Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, refused the draft annulment of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
The MPs refused in second reading the proposed amendment to reduce the penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having concluded a previously disadvantaged agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court is due on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the judgment of political revenge of the regime and has provoked a process of suspicions of bias of the court to the west as well.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 Members.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already won its victory.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winner remains to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but they are moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has established the usual law of the Sharia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a country free of crime because for a theft you cut your hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, the possible non-respecters of faith are subject to capital punishment...
It is the Qur'an who will join in place of the personality of the dictator the society composed of opposite tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot represent it and as we would certainly not love it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and it would probably not be advantageous for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted the help with recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who directed the strikes of NATO, but rather Allah, to whom they celebrated the greatness of every attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not a part of it.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our pelices turned away from the dictator as a political ally without bringing any profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militaryly deal with Libya.
So there is no problem for the premises to get rid of the "croarses".
Without land occupation, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of the protection of human rights interests.
As little as we can prevent these charia followers from doing so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eye of investors.
A statistical tornado passed on Tuesday over Europe.
Each state has published GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all records.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France's growth by 0.4%.
Both countries changed the data for the second quarter during which Germany was better positioned than expected (by 0.3% rather than by 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was a question of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
However, GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, it is confirmed that there is a gradual decline in economic growth.
Results are worse than analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to data projected and recalculated periodically.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is what analysts had planned.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Performance over ten years is 28.45%
The yields of the obligations of Spain and Italy are rising to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The yields of the Czech bonds remain below 4% while the situation worsens in the region.
A vote was taken in Germany to say that the ECB should be the last instance .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and competed for 200 million
The performance of the football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super-Cech and guardian Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also successfully defended its qualification in the second part and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second part.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super-Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
Montenegrins were under pressure up to the second part because of a specific Czech defence.
The vicitms of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent from the European Championship next year, and also a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech Football Fund.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams had difficulty mounting combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not come to perpetuate the Czech defence that answered precisely the long shots even during the first half of the time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield
Hundreds of senior school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support the nuclear programme of their country in this way in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Ispahan have created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
They have thus openly stated that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran had not ceased to strengthen its nuclear armament.
A possible attack by Iranian nuclear institutions is reported in Israel.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: do not eat breakfast and take the carcuerie for dinner
Over one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren weigh above the average and 5% are obese.
As the current research shows, obese children come from families who have a unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models around it is.
At the tables of obese children, for example, carcuterie 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had dinner fries according to the survey carried out with awareness-raising action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In small-scale families sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most of today's schoolchildren - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last year of school and attended 900 primary schools in Czechia.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", a action supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 students from sixth to third have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children in overweight, or even obese, is the absence, of proper diet and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch - tasting- dinner, which is a basic principle of good food", says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and catering for dinner
Experts draw attention to the fact that in order to have healthy development, you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Czechia, only 23% of students' families eat at the same time.
In most families each takes his breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been found is that one tenth of the population doesn't eat breakfast at all.
Yet breakfast is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that obese children's families are more often consumed with unhealthy fries.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks drink every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children asked make sport regularly but for parents it is only half, only 15%.
Get your food ready.
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls in 13 schools) to prepare their own food on the basis of opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the ideal for a healthy diet."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of cakes, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is particularly a great preference for sweet lemonades", is indicated in the results of the investigation.
For lunch are the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not want to be fertilized and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Head of Health
The investigation also showed that children are prepared to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obesity is not a coincidence," a determined commitment was made to go to a healthy diet," the results of the investigation were reported.
The most significant was, for example, with regard to sweet lemonades, as children have begun to give preference to drinking water.
Children have mostly checked white meat and fish as a main dish on the questionnaire and would reduce sugar and knedliky (Czech specialty of bread flour or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals say
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry with the fact that there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I didn't think about what would happen next.
The presentations by three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what's going on in place.
And it'll be worse.
The more we approach final exams and the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "burred".
This time we have with Director Alenka (there are no boys in the course) to treat how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, no particular curve, another of the overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically minimize broad arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have come to highlight the character very nicely and also not to dress too prominently of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
If, for example, there is a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or trousers do not pass at all, that is worth making it custom.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccablely is invaluable.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel a lot better than in the one that slides constantly, rolls and does not hold to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance, Tucker may afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of fabric, or embroidery.
Of course there are many examples of various appearances and I am happy that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that with what I have to do at home there's too much.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into account the present appearance, the type of personality mode and its appearance.
I should "dress" Miranda Kerr, which you may know from the Victoria Secret campaign.
At the bottom of my mind, it's my pleasure, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who's taken nearly 100 pounds lately (don't take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work on graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting also on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only wears physics but creates, for example, the productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphicist, has kept us from all this.
But this... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse aspect to the Saturday session, filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, fashion graphic Jakub Polanka and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist can work with one dress differently.
Variability is crucial for this example.
As for example this trench-coat that has to be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can dress the bare body, with scarves and take it in a photo as a dress.
Or just go up the sleeves or collar and have a new look immediately.
"Play with that," he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start contradicting it," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more variety of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say, for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (including a dozen models) I have to be ready to "retire" at least a fortnight.
And also, a dress and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to count on this in the course of a model creation.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In Czechia, the approach to the use of stylists' services remains frivolous.
And the faces known sometimes regard them as useless (it's enough that I know something but what I seem to be going on to the second level).
And if someone gets to do a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he tells us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we only have to sail on the google and make sure that the boulevard info reveals the celebrity in question, whether it is thin or thick, etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it's not enough for the stylist to get in the fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresss and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
You know how to guess people, don't flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort his wardrobe and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything out and tell him, My God, what a horror."
"You'll find a few things you'll find pretty and him you'll advise them with," said Mario.
The latter has shown us concretely what everything has to contain what is called the "platevka" or the stylist bag.
It's the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things like scissors, rollers for depilation, or even spindles for feeding, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products like bags, or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple are not usable because they could break the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we were not only listening people but who tried something practical, they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could get out, at fortori outside.
And so we got caught and caught.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors to avoid inadvertent injury.
So there is a real need for skills.
Mario enjoyed it when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I'm reporting is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of the course
I increasingly begin to understand that styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed Le Run competes throughout America.
By Way of Review
Originally a smooth race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work.
This fills up to a certain extent the ambition of everyone but it serves nothing if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitled part The Run has produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new lead with the already old Need for Speed race series and exit a kind of game from playable parts that would not only count on points.
We were therefore curious how the passages added during which the main hero came out of his car and did what he wanted.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is entirely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole pulls down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of incomprehensible pheasantness on the part of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are caught in the adventure of the main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them starts to take part in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the steering wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten steps and then over 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the steps planned in different environments that are rather different from each other and are interesting.
The player doesn't have the feeling for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are quite beautiful, even though the graphic technical level is of the same type as previous series.
Finally, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The trials are more than occasionally approved of an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that avalanche does not fall upon you.
Alongside this, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There's only a small number but that's enough.
There are moments you are trying to overcome the number of opponents (like in a classic race) and then you will run against the watch (conventional duel with the chronometer) and then again you are waiting for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make you difficult.
The novelty is the out-of-vehicle passages.
Rather, it's an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs in front of someone and you have to help him by taping on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is as good as this because this element does not risk to disturb and, in the context described above, places itself in the elements that please the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is nothing extraordinary at present, but we cannot say that it is negative.
With regard to realistic simulation, you will have to go somewhere else.
But although we can better find in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a certain period of time.
With the difference of the driving model, the collision model is not yet ready.
We do not expect this game to be a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, it is not entirely good.
During tight overruns you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy volts.
Or they'll find themselves in crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really upsets you.
The reboot is done so that when you have broken the figure or have gone out into the decor the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 reboots.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't happen as it should, that something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and the solution needs to be found by recalling the piece of itinerary in question.
The big part of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that have to be passed in a certain way or that does not happen.
Otherwise you meet on a specific location of "civil" vehicles in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or one minute in delay.
What angers these are the situations when you see easily passing the opponent between two cars coming in reverse direction and when you arrive, you either have to stand aside and turn them around or slow them down.
It's equal if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always happens near your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
All the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This pisses the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long bridge upside down.
The opponent must come before you at all costs.
When he passes before you he hides the view of other vehicles in reverse direction and you collide a lot of times.
We can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you are getting bored quickly.
And that's bad because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique itineraries, that the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You need to be careful about petrol pumps on the routes because you can change there by car but most of the time you have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, big American cylinders for right highways and super exotic sports cars on very technical roads, for example on the lacy roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places you know about adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that are in addition to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest driver level, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog feature that compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult hits to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (ca looks like) where you are driving in the dark on the tracks (ca looks like).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a metro line that sends you the car directly to the scrap metal.
In writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about creating this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really super.
What's troubling is that in more extreme situations, imaging doesn't hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This mainly concerns accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer useful for you.
The sound part is good and the track is in the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the most young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confusing.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
Fun is really good, but prepare yourself to get the mistakes to lock you in your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
Le Pupil Students in concert with Charles University Chours
The Festa Academy festival offers for the third time festivals that connect the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs from upper and secondary schools.

Interested will find all information on the Internet pages of the festival www.festaacademica.cz.
Vice-nova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs act like negativists and Euroseptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players are used to their new role," and Miléna Vicenova began her presentation to the Faculty of Law of the Czech Ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different bodies of the EU and their relations so understandable and visible, to the extent that a large number of speakers from Charles University Faculty of Law could send her, she showed how she took her motto "understanding and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Ms Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms were echoed that it is fade, that it is a round-skin, that it cannot fill any mission and I must say that it has cut the breath to everyone because it holds its role to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the context of an answer to the question: "Who is it in the European Union?" "What telephone number do I have to call?", so as an important step towards the unity and greater legibility of the Union's policy in the face of the states, such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid our syrecky (sweet cheese that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda she has lived, lived and will live in close proximity to the European Council.
It qualified the Czech Presidency as a success two years ago.
The Czechs have resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of Mrs. Ambassador, "the activity has beaten its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself now.
Moreover, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which has become very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and for savings, which sector will be the priority, which countries will help most, at least, all is to be resolved in future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador reminded her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a understandable Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As must be understood by the citizen that it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornichons, bananas differ widely or that no one has forbidden us to do syrecky".
It wants to use the EU's environment better and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe at several speeds awaits us
According to the Czech Ambassador, they have the reputation of being Euroseptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault is the result of several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a small support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish came to me, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French man says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group of Visegrad still doing?"and he is not happy."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, these are tough new budgetary policy rules that are awaiting the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at several speeds, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the enhanced cooperation institute."
First of all, it was said that the countries that want it and those who do not want it will cooperate with them."
"There will be a lot of such institutes and there will be a really two-speed Europe," Mrs. Vicenova expects.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis for all themes having an impact on the EU to be discussed among all EU members and not only the Eurozone members.
History of a brand:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone was to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy as close as possible, the closest would be "the long term".
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm felt as very present and yet since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that many of the world's problems can be solved as long as people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the fingerprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the company's culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years because it remained faithful to its core values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more"has delayed for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to deal with his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM's people were the only first American employees to have paid vacations, insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and custodians.
Similarly IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
Society was at the beginning brilliant in the discovery of talent - as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano with the head of IBM.
It has been working at IBM for thirty years and is currently in the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has done what is called jamy, brain-storming online from what come many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that provides a secure position in business.
"From the beginning IBM had a rather institutional concept than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard Economics School and author of the book on IBM.
"IMM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems by using its technology," added Geogre Colony from the Consulting Forrester Research firm.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is familiarly known to the United States with regard to its slogan - in one hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest firms in the world.
It is of course the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, Council services at server product level up to nanotechnology.
It has numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.
His discoveries include the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM was found this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it passed in 1996 Microsoft.
Previews in progress
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the client and of the time - IBM for example has not succeeded in betting on a OS/2 own operating system, the Prodige service online or the PCjr IBM computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the forward movement you can't emotionally stay stuck on the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it out.
In contrast, for example, Microsoft's account that stands at the base and remains under the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a dominant place.
However, in 1990, it was with more than the strongest motivation of participation representing hardware.
As of 2000 IBM sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, over the past period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of perspective technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the principles of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its investment volume.
Now it appeared that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The IBM share price increased by 120 percent from 2008 onwards, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
For this we can expect this flexible giant to control other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
The IBM (International Business Machines) company was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four companies whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointive" ones, the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was chairing the Society's Supervisory Board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a competing company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then made shadow to the founder of the firm - it is about Watson's ideas that so far rest on the identity and culture of society.
Watson led the Kusqu' firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - from cheese and meat cutters to registered caisses.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, turnover increased to up to $9 million and the expansion of the firm began in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership it was his son who occupied the chair of director Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s people and computers of IBM helped NASA to guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded IBM in the last three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas that have not yet been exploited, such as transport and city management.
As far as IBM trade is concerned, it has recently developed a "Smart Commerce" platform that helps businesses manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history on our territory as well.
She created her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first Central and Eastern European country.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also the research and development team at the global level that is responsible for the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
Only she was unable to wait and established clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave summer shelter to Bartosova in her house, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not dismiss the singer.
And he publicly confesses that he loved him.
Over time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's connection and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separates there will be no wife to welcome her at the door of the house.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost ass, but a man with whom I have a special relationship", he let Rychtarova filter by showing that she has detached herself from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The society continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Dariana we're discussing completely normal but we're not sleeping together," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop him.
"We don't sleep together and I'm not interested in knowing where she's going, who and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take full responsibility for myself," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Is that also about you?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all of them, like each other, are capable of "getting them out of their sleeve".
My dear ladies, you will meet in the following lines of the female vices who are able to pump the blood of men's veins.
Purchasing
Your half of you make remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy and package at the time of the balances?
In your case, you can speak of purchases as vice.
Some women believe that they should restrict their passion for buying.
But you'll say, who would resist the winery of the clothing stores, to look for yourself nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse he's waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"Would I need to lean at least 5 kilos - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Do these phrases not remind you of anything?
Yes?
You are therefore among those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop caring for yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partners are always complaining about their appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints is increasing and women become poisoning.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite drive.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the soil, make the dust, undress the bathroom - and that twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they broke the sink, smashed the window of the living room, and that gives you a lot of work?
If you are suffering from this obsession, try to keep in mind that there is no need to exaggerate and that order and cleanliness should not be at first in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationship and even family peace.
The work of the sword
"Put this worn overcoat into the trash."
"Are you going to put on these old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do with land."
If you do this work on your partner this way several times a day, you're really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much digging...
Defamation, Persifling
Defamation, persplementation, but also insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and thus are happy to deal with subjects such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets escape a little harmless persplexing here and there.
However, the hand on the heart is a woman's particularity.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflate, even look down on others and are around them - especially at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
Hockeyist Jagr twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL Monday game on Caroline's ice and is again leading the Czech players productive for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who still made an extra pass and was named the best player in the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also recorded two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told extra-Atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game he'd give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you" explained Jagr after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shooting of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the pallet and presented it to the Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer went down, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the best three," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play in the end of my career with a hockey player like him."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline did a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again Dwyer on a penalty shot she ended with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read didn't miss out on any other complications that end up in two against one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) left to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and arrived there," describes the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia came with this victory in the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montréal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he went out second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candiennes did not face an experienced defender their advance of two goals lost after a 2:3 penalty shot.
Tomas Plekanec didn't turn any of their attacks.
That's the fact that the back line was sick, which mostly haunted the local coach rather than lost fists because they only played the game with 5 defenders.
"It's null."
"We only played the game with one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement replacement has not been enough and we have not been able to resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For this we had limits, "he added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, a Czech defender, took part in the thirtieth Winnipeg attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the Jets goals, which arrested a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time were offering trips especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, as trips to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a western inclination and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, in Poland or in the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter or the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however, it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The agreement for currencies that was the condition to travel to the west was denied to people "politically incorrect" who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
Czech travel has since experienced a great revolution in 1989.
Although until 1989 the holiday in East Germany and Bulgaria were at most, Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world.
The great paradox we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The removal of visas in the last 90s in neighbouring western countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least one moment.
For example, in Paris travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our incomes did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at this time to take with itself its own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the exchangeability of the Czech crown which enabled our tourists finally after decades of freely buying Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average wage have increased what has caused another important time around 1997.
Thanks to an increasing travel demand, travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter links that thanks to contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
In the late 1990s, Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world except the EU which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year, direct air charters have taken Czech tourists to faraway hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100000 Czechs who visit exotic countries each year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to settle completely in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for vacation abroad including the attached charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this could end with a situation without a solution "a bed"
Nearly 5 months already Czech football is without President and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hasek to the head of the Czech Republic Football Association will not yet be known after a General Assembly to take place in Nymburk on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting regulations should be adopted.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the management of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the year after Hasek the football went back to differences between the Chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16 when a new president had to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily at the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was not even a question of dealing with the way to choose.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, like, statutory representatives or also fully-fledged staff.
In this single point, there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the State and Law Bureau, that representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences still continue with regard to the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which, in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also failed to contribute to the situation
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The apple of discord lies in the following: whether to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Association du football de la República Czecha Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, the third round wins the number of candidates who have received the highest percentage vote in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to retire to win the candidate who will have received the largest percentage of votes from the two chambers.
And the Czech side investigates the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the votes.
"It would only then lose the idea of two previous rounds, and this would completely deny the two-cameral concept," Svoboda admits, which includes the objections of the Moravian side and says that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even if he considers that the settlement of elections based on the most advantageous status Pelta among all candidates.
"I wish to see the maximum vote in accordance with the statutes of the association".
"For there is not yet any sagrene ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen's owner who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations was mainly defined against Pelta.
There's still optimism.
According to him, there will be a new President in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone".
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation" adds Jablnek's officer who, among the three, has the greatest experience in the management of football both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are trends in changing the regulations to design."
"It may again cause a blockage to the General Assembly."
"I still hope the sound reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement on all sides.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but which can tell whether the entire direction of football will be complete for the game.
The special chartered flight to Podgorice, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee on the field of reprisals.
At the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth and Sports Education Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parts in the country's strongest sports association and to bring them into agreement.
In the game there are many: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union, which must determine the leadership of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the battle for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the leader of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to all he requested for a new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association (AFRT) he would not be campaigned for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I struggle for him and do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," said Paclik to the Czech Press Agency (CCTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the AFRT's head that would be favoured in the first place for this election.
Paclik also points out that if he won the elections he would hold this position as President only until 2013 scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would well see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but who is not related to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said to be particularly awkward is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Roman Berbr Regional Football Union, a man with the renowned contraversity who is known in the backstages as lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates 'the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to occupy this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high-flight merchant, it would be even less favorable to football," proclaimed Paclik.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of hearing in an investigation into a case of corruption, for which Pelta went without a penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA" said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen."
In the event that Paclik triumphed at Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly, who had finished with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
"He has great abilities."
"He would be able to introduce himself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as the manager of the Association he would not be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September drew a great deal of attention when he spoke for the annulment of the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macella who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to run private companies and he has also been leading the Plzen Club since last year, which has celebrated with his support last May his first division triumph.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and bring it a certain culture."
"I would slow down the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, which leads to situations of poor taste," said Paclik, who does not look for his antipathy for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power with high-level policies would allow for more money to be obtained for sport of gambling tax.
"This is one of the key points the new President should take care of."
"If it's the gambling tax as the political parties say it, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current link to the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the President of AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again connected with Jablneco and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"That's not the ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my actions from Plzen's club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half after," said Paclik.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to bed situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates to the Miroslav Pelta Presidency has promised that if elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end to the dispute in the future on the settlement of the elections.
Jablnek's official is before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that today's success of the football performance should calm this victory before the vote.
Pelta before the election in September that did not take place has just promised to devote itself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly, and this two-month delay could enable him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and are waiting for a President to arrive on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he adds, but it is primarily related to the Jablneg club, worked a lot of years in the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That is also why he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of the Statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone saw."
"If there had not been all these various interpretations, we would have had a President since September," said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took all the attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take on all responsibilities if it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
He then strives, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He had previously stated that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized with regard to his legal training and that he knew to be his first Vice-President.
Nor has he long attacked Tonas Paclik who on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and has already had some success."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honourable and many people were surprised during the campaign."
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said at the address of his opponent, but he remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to the national representation.
It's supposed to be a football vitrine.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that begin with that of the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for all the football," she told the Czech Press Agency CTK on the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment at the head of the football would not lead to any change in people.
"I should get to know all employees," he told Strahov, where there's a sense of nervousness since there's no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of disagreement about how to vote on the third round, we will be able to overcome it."
"Football needs credibility and he will only get it when there's a new leader in his head," as Pelta's optimistically stated two days before the most likely decisive day for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT would start working hard.
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday this would not please many people, he would say.
Rajchl, however, promises that in the event he would be elected, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring to football more money and continue the work begun by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying that I'm going to do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members can deal with a specific area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions for football to face a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He stated, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth the blow and if I have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in the wheels and cast doubts on each of my actions," he explained why he hesitated.
"A lot of people have said to me that I must not give up because they would also give up."
"This trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, we say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the past two years, there has been a great deal of de facto work and I don't want to drop it."
"There are processes that have been initiated that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them." He said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation within the Union does not return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
" Behind him are people who would do football in such a way that it would be only for those who were chosen."
"One can blame me for a certain number of things but certainly not to bear anyone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it not only those who have been chosen
And he again confirms that he would only be a President for Czechia.
"And if there's anyone who says otherwise, I'm ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts a Czech and the other vicar whose winners would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation like at present with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech House that elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be success," Rajchl said, who is considering among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations with televisions and the gambling law.
On the contrary, the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has to offer football.
"No one can question Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he was elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make a notable change among people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his success," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
Parasols in ovni optics, beautiful pools in Budapest: Who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his legs rest tired in gas baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Spreaded on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged cupolas, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the Art New meticulously restored from these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool enjoyed it, she would note in her book without delay all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were investigated in this way by the historian of Meder architecture and presented them in his book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The covered municipal swimming pools of Münich, the historic bathroom palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
It has led its "travels to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a real fervent in the culture of the bath.
Meder, explains that she has not much interest in sport but he feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is annoying that swim-bearers should just look at blue tiles and be comfortable with the javel water bridge while players breathe from the scent smelling of epicéea forests or can listen to the funnel of birds in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools must in fact always be if ugly" said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water double reinforces the architecture
A dive in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders were given a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are optically double: high vaults, multicolored tiles, trampling.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives you the desire to make a jump in the blue.
The Meder collector discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Alongside the splendid well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (bain of cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and found in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zürich bath you have the whole city in your eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can watch the animation on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal to the sky rise.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of Javel's water does not emanate from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate from a odor of sulphur, from the Harpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekscsaba is a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be found in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues you to the skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During his search for beautiful pools, Iris Meder also experienced disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool and outdoor of Czechoslovakia, she was in front of a barricaded land.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was then closed.
By taking a look at the new red-white-yellow building-Art window, she observed the development of weeds between the tiles.
It observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: The spa palace of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; we can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its design in 1844 but also a maurial hall in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it originated from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a good performance that melt construction styles if different in such a formidable unit," said Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon speculation about raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the group leader then wants to bring about the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions break down this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation into the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this article, author Harald Schumann points out that the speculation of the Scholarships on global raw materials, rises prices upwards and that the banks share a complicity with the global famine.
The consumer protection campaign specifically aligns itself with the head of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting the same way.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, the majority of experts share the view that betting companies have seconded their offers and demanded - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism of American competitors differently: He promised to investigate the blame and said, "No case is worth putting into play the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review is to be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, as usual.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be achieved.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built audio Image
The leader of Foodwatch Thilo Bode praised the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how today's banks are damaging the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be especially under obligation today.
" Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation," Bode said.
"That doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may appear at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the group's CEO wants to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving his duties.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything that is foreseen in the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with a abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And with regard to possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One out of two would solve investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires of 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank would offer investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many bank clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one out of two would terminate all investments for which money was injected in speculations on raw materials following the survey.
43 per cent would advise such a bank around them, 49 per cent answered that they would reflect on the termination of their account to change their bank.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then collapsed.
Now it is again open and is held in the exhibition house.
If you are excited about modern post-war architecture, its clear forms, glass hangars, its lively and daring features and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal Brussels exhibition in 1958 is a good example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
Construction is still considered an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavillon for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became famous at the international level in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the station of southern Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang works of art, so it was not a good environment.
However, it has been used as long as contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly weak.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavillon, now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday night the museum Belvédère opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance at all points of view.
The new departure was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedère.
Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among other things, in his youth as an artistic skater, subsequently at Sotheby's, at Guggenheim Museum and as the founder director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she has led in particular to the completion of the transformation work with men of politics and the protection of monuments, she has obtained public funds and private sponsorship and has established the exploitation of it.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exposed, a coffee shop and a bookstore are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the Krischanitz realization was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and sensitizedly expanded Joseph Olbracht's secession and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "mostly every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and his change of use.
In the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "a gouffer in energy," Krischanitz said.
The window profiles of glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced glass fibers were placed and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.
The thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements have made place for the new operation, a light panel slammed between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge led to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but always the light Schwanzer Pavillon.
The exterior doors of origin have remained, the house is painted in a protection against red-brown rust.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision by the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"There are materials that are good and cheap that should be found, and that also please the office of monument protection," said Krischanitz, and he draws attention to a rough ground in the ground.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavillon, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Jardin Suisse is just setting up the "quartier of the central station" recently planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance is perhaps to happen: the House of the 21st Century could benefit from the reinforcement of another construction Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg purchased the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, it already negotiates with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million extra this year.
The "Bild"-Zeitung newspaper reported in advance, invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snowing of rail and rail facilities is expected to double and increase to 16,000 people.
The objective is to clear the rails from snow and ice up to the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the necessary track equipment for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube was cautioned by the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents that occurred this winter as well.
Last winter the railway society had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacked, among other things, reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
For many years now, many new regional trains have been awaiting authorization from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing what it has been doing for years, since it has to have the axles of the ICE trains checked significantly more often at the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE in the central station of Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not enough, the past of this sector giant also caught him in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays compared to $145 million (EUR 106 million) to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The financial market regulator NCAUA carries a whole series of charges to large banks, encouraging cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and led banks downhill.
"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution in this regard, without the parties entering a court proceedings," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank recognized no fault in comparison.
This is also valid for Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCAU President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the cooperative banks of the USA and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
NCAA is trying to repair the damage incurred by several billion dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first in their kind.
The regulator has also taken other major banks in part and in summer he has been assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents, this is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit homes are at the base.
When the US real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though events have already occurred for a few years, at present it is blowing on American banks a stormy wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have resorted to numerous remedies to seek redress or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It blames 18 major international banks, the two US real estate finannie Mae and Freddie Mac for being in-kind advantage in mortgage business of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to file an appeal to FHFA, which here is a number of operations totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities demand that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increased by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests colossal amounts in the IT company of IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares for a value of more than $10 billion.
So far, the American major investor Warren Buffett explains that he is constantly investing in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad predictions.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
It had already had to be understood much earlier than IBM offers mainly services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight attack in the world of finance.
As a result, the TI IBM activity is granted the right now to be known as "Mr IBM".
Car Buffett today revealed to the CNBC economic issue, which he has purchased since March of IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway thus became a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IMM never knew anything about this commitment until now.
He congratulated management, who had made reasonable profits even during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time put on IT lucrative services as a "exploitation of accounting centres."
The computer pioneer, over 100 years of age, offers both Software and consultation as well as very performing business calculators.
Buffett has so far avoided technology companies.
He says he invests only in businesses that he understands business.
But on the contrary, Buffett is engaged in rail brakes, lubricant manufacturers or machines.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as parts from a wide range of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rück municipality.
This 81-year-old had resumed in the 1960s the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company and had erected it in the ranks of one of the most prestigious world-wide companies, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
Following Buffett's investment announcement, IBM shares increased by one percent to the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also called IBM, has a stock market value of over $220 billion and has Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft's Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of Zwickauer's cell, Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would be reborn now.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist background.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish people respond with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks the spectre that was believed to have died for a long time re-appeared: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was no more violence comparable to this extreme right-wing context against the Turks.
However, there has never been a question of xenophobia in Germany.
The right-wing extremist network, which has been detected, however, reveals proportions of which the dimension is far from predictable.
"This is a return to the bloody ideology", "Tel was the title of the online release of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right bubbe.
It was reasoned that the Turkish community in Germany had reacted: this weekend she called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence at Brandenburg's gate.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought of a ceremony on the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a history of success.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a gifle: "the gift of Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of the unique conditions.
"eça cominà taner", is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He pointed out that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turks forums and they subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why has it not already come much earlier in the minds of the German authorities to do research in certain suspicious environments of extreme right, the authors are surprised.
More than one is ready for at least rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be blocked, it will remain for migrants nothing but self-defence and arms".
"it will be the best self-defense."
"Inland peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the network as a whole," says Selen.
What that means if inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has more clearly shown the Turks living here than there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, on which mistrust and distance by acts of violence could result.
However, the attacks have sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past mistakes
In the past, it was mainly the failure of the German policy following the attacks by the Turkish press: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of the Turkish State, he was represented at the funerals in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was counting at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German-Turks has been towards the "state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of greater clarification and re-evaluation of extreme right terrorism in Germany, this time a clear message is needed.
The scandal bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous Bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial and skate crisis in the meantime from one crisis to the next.
It's a German who has to lead now.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After its spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was known in July, that it would occupy an almost as spectacular position in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praised; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently obtained solidity and made a pleasant comment on future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded in the Turn round."
"I am pleased with the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities market in London had diverted all the Bank's security systems and had blown up about €1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS has been considered as suffering - and all ask: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank as of February 2012.
And he will resume the Presidency of Administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economy and president of the bank, and he would certainly need a period of adaptation.
At the same time he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
In fact, the UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been stabbing for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing, it seems, spares such proud Swiss bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, quiet and solid, but also rude, had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become a very large bank in the area of banking investment.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later a long-standing bank teacher in Zurich says: "I have always taken the BUS as a good bank model in front of my students."
"From the current point of view, one wonders: how could I have just cheated on this point?"
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something didn't turn around at the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, which was so far regarded as a high intellectual and a great banker.
A few months later we felt what he was leaving for.
The division of the bank had burned with subprime documents and had to cross billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross over.
For this, she did find investors, but who, a short time ago, would have rubbed the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which had passed under silence, to the extent that its name had never even been learned.
But that was only the first time.
In April 2008, this worsened.
The bank was to announce again losses amounting to billions, the president of the Marcel Ospel Board, who was still in 2006 the second most well-paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank purchased tens of billions of problematic securities from the UBS, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet for the UBS 2007 increased to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We haven't been able to save the UBS yet," says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second disaster followed.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy clientele, who had cheated the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus, the UBS published more or less that it had helped in tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich customers: prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
This is followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: bad speculation and asset management because of tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a bit of a calm return, and as we thought, the UBS would come out of it, it followed from this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single flame marketer €1.7 billion, before the bank realized that something didn't turn around.
And it's published: with investment bank risk management it still doesn't seem to work.
"In the case of Adobe, it has been found that the control of risks has changed too little," said Martin Janssen, a economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich Banking Institute.
So the financial director of a large German bank is sure of this: "the problem of the UBS is that it does not control the risks at hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken their place, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unbreakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich is still pairing with the solid private Swiss bank cliché - it's just a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its seat at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Zurich Lake, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's are found here among Swiss tradition stores just like those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the palace of Crédit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another deviated from the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with both major banks as well.
The UBS would have become too big, it finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the morals of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, made high profits and then the break: no European financial institution lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"On Wednesday, the small country's government coalition of seven million people has undertaken the greatest rescue operation in their nation's history," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The Fall of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks together concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and continuously recorded an increase.
What helped is that the two different pre-decessive banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a more poor, but certainly already more highly internationalized.
At once, international investment banks have had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the ascent of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who set a way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted himself until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
The staff of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group has always said the same word of order: dethroning Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" classifications, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all the UBS wanted to climb all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of currency and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
However, the business advisors, who had responsibility for it, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the "Fixed Income" banking jargon, there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS launched itself into an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Associated with growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. subprime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packaged and sent forward value documents based on American mortgage loans - but which has also retained risks.
Even when other banks had been looking for a long time to go down.
"Even in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, the bank expert.
The more euphoria the greater the fall is brutal.
A manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts, it turned out to be harder than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and have so far been bankable.
The one running the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger, already has an idea: to stop the investment bank, concentrate on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) want to go so far.
But the investment bank must atrophy, as much as it is clear so far.
Next Thursday, the bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only supposed to be transitional when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has imposed itself: it must carry out the affairs of the UBS on a sustainable basis, the Bank of Zurich communicated on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to progress in the mid-1990s.
He cancels 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked.
He says publicly so far only that he was going to look for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, and there are also other signs of weakness coming from banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: "it is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early in its view to invest in obligations coming from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett has cast a ten-year-old principle into the wind and entered the American technology industry.

Smart corneas spread in cities
In many places, brakes are considered "bird problem" but experts claim that these very intelligent animals have not been chasing cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Cornelles have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are multiplied because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
During the first Ostfriesisch symposium on the cornellas, experts said that it is no longer possible to chase the friars from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They seek alternatives in cities
Nature protectors were also based on the problems of cities on the exodus of specially protected friars: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, planning and slaughtering of typical curving trees made life difficult for birds.
Cornels are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 couple of coves in the westälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative publicity because of the carnation massacre in the region.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and killing them with particularly brutal gourds.
"The normal expulsion, the evidentiation, is useless," noted Leer's planner and landscape planner, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using water under pressure or to kill trees, often resulting in adverse consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Bade-Württemberg.
"The animals go away, the great colonies divide and they disperse in other places."
The evidence is only imaginable in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of animal whitening with a reverse conditioning and sticky offers to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for "info panels instead of stretchers" to establish completely different relationships with the: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-chemining-educational of the crows at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing the lives of these very intelligent brakes.
In the meantime, this project was adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of bird noise: "There are a great number of communications, these birds have much to say about."
Animal intelligence and skill are legendary: Freux not only use working instruments to reach a regal but they themselves manufacture their tools as working tools.
Hethologists at Cambridge University recently tested four brakes, to what extent the intelligence of the birds comes.
In an experience, the birds quickly learned that they had to crush a scaffolding with stones in order to achieve a larvae.
Without much training, they firmly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second test, the cunning cornellas then had to solve a more sloppy problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
Birds could not reach their butt with their beak.
However, the researchers had put iron wires at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four brakes were even successful from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks suddenly remained unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will also participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czechia, Croatia and Ireland bought the latest tickets in the 2012 European Championships in Poland and then eliminated Ukraine.
Led by the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal turned against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and became perfect, after the 0:0th of the match, its fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the elimination return match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) had already been obvious.
Nothing was also burned in the zero 0:0 match between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72e, 82e) and Miguel Veloso (80e) marked the other shots for Portugal.
The former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a hand-made 11-metre penance (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) made a double shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Stadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a 30-meter-in-a-front shot in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills of shooting at a distance and fired at a distance of 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to attacker Edin Dzeko.
Ex-Wolfsburger, the leader of Manchester City's English championship, initiated a headball heading down the crossbar, the balloon did not cross the goal line (33th).
Jiracek drew a goal for Czech
Finally, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, um, um, um, um,
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian Penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card in Portuguese (36e).
On the other hand, Stark granted a 9-foot penalty to the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 Vice-Champion of Europe succeeded four times and everything became clear.
For Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
For example, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) also had the chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goal Guardian Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9e).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the Stevan Jovetic duo and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to the Cech shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the aid of the world class guard of the Czechs who had already killed, once again, the attacker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50e).
The goal was short-lived before the end, finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the Zagreb football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, Turks in Zagreb were not able to go beyond 0:0.
While the national coach Guus Hiddink also had to abandon his seat on the bench of a third EM in 2002, Croats were able to rejoice on their fourth round at the end of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the time of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic from Dortmund at 62 e Minute, the legions of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish have celebrated their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had already successfully supported 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) has equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first chance.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence was able to prevent a possible goal of the -the first buyer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars (€1.5 billion) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," PDG Bill McDermott announced to its clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader of enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
To date, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of SAP's 176,000 worldwide customers are located in this growing country.
Growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.

"Now, we want to expand our activities..." said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
The slaughter of personal masses
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that warms your heart.
A tip to start: carefully tear this page and make it your page label.
You will learn about these people in detail. In this Romanesque account by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the shadows of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here a book out of the ordinary he accurately described as "an anti-history book."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is hardly any ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it could look like." There are the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of more or less ordinary men and women, from both sides of the war, from young schoolchildren and botanists to hikers, passing by doctors, ambulancemen and vendors.
Some will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose their members, they will become crazy or they will lose their lives.
Their lives vacillate here like the waxes of a church: while some of them turn off, new ones come together.
Peter Englund's book differs from traditional history books.
It denies the idea that the First World War is summed up only by the terrible war of trenches on the western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" artfully describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under rocks; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies tset are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina who can cord it.
When cannon blows are at a distance, and you are a mother at home, do you stay or flee?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been enhanced by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracyist theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English feed in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are primarily drawn from memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most address deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German student, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere Ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep's fat (and finished with a false wood bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried skin of potatoes; seeds of wooden shoes."
He states that "837 authorised substitute meats are recorded in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse to savagery and says about war: "You feel that after all, it is what men were destined for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, reading a newspaper or best-seller, and rather than claiming that such varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your heavy and nailed shirt.
On the other hand, a British soldier realizes that he is at risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we are reluctant to sacrifice ourselves, we hope to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, it's rather comparable to "a man convicted secretly."
Other comments concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," wrote Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He seizes the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beast of the early century: the well-articulated mass murderer and ideologically convinced, in well-cut clothing, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act in an unexpected manner; there are as many basic behaviours as there are heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, that soldiers buy and spread on the genital organs in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a blindness for life."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he seized the way in which the war " triggered forces that were exclusively uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People start wondering why their leaders are making them a war.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the West Nothing New", by Erich Maria Remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had come up from his book, grab your hands on this page where the list of people is listed and burned with a lighter.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some carrying helmets.
Monday night to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all the errors of a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the outset that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against the department's regulation and generated a public solidarity storm for the demonstrators.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared to observe the progress of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall, for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that consist of moving a large number of police quickly - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park were reached "at the last minute", said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know and who were called did not know they would go to Zuccotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones who know they'd go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city has managed to hold a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police wanted to clean the park but had been pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of plans.
The Tuesday operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the district - dozens of officers used to serve in particularly criminal areas.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and coming to the park during the day, as migrants, so one hour in the morning was a convenient time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The light and recorded messages from speakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
While community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue cutter, many protesters simply gathered their business and left.
No tent was hit before 1:45 p.m. told the police, which allowed the occupants time to bring their affairs together.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson of the head of the police department, claimed that this measure had been taken only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from seeing the intervention within the park, which was rudely withheld by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police were moving west across the heavy business of demonstrators, including luggage, plastic lawn and sheets filled with clothing, teams of the sanitation department followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, said Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
There was no arrest in the park before 3:30 said Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Mostly for "public order trouble and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most grateful officer to be found on the premises.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were patient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barracks were located on Cortlandt Street, a pastry of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
The police have seen the perimeter widen well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, mostly equipped with shields, would have even been seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
About 5h00, south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped on the top of a police car. Others were seen cracking down on the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood appeared on the wheel of the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The school aid union continues the city for dismissals
The union which represents hundreds of school leavers who have lost their jobs last month plans to bring a trial to the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate to schools receiving disadvantaged schools.
The prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to attempt to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school aids, parents' coordinators and other employees, being part of the city's least well paid, lost their jobs on October 7, and union leaders compared these to political revenge for not letting the city access to a health fund led by working groups, and which would have enabled the budget gap to close last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this charge.
At a hearing of the Municipal Council last month, Chancellor Dennis Walcott said that the dismissals were part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council replied that the dismissal of school aid was not specified in the budget.
The Council officers of the 37th District stated that they would file a notice of complaint, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce prosecutions to the Manhattan Supreme Court of State.
Dennis M. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City will be the defender. The complainants will be represented by eight laid-off workers, all of black or Latin American origin, like most of the school aid that lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the city's legal department, said the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore could not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints from the New York Times, the union sent the number of redundancies to schools in the most disadvantaged areas of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there is no dismissal on Staten Island, and a few barely in the institutions of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school grants have lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern Bronx districts.
Noting the loss of five school grants out of eight employees at Harlem's 36 public school, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecutions state that "It's not a well-known parent district that can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget for public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each underprivileged student registration.
The union also claims that school directors may have been misled by certain terms in a memo allowing the dismissal of parents coordinators.
The memo used the term "extension" to describe the action, even though "extension" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "six parent coordinators have been fired", and "not just because of overrun".
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on the question of Libya
Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats had reached agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It would have taken a successful uprising, capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Kadhafi as well as the American involvement.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republicain - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their rebellion and the American troops for their "heart".
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving the military role of the United States in the NATO mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day as the bill failed, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of US operations in Libya.
The American mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress was upset enough to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under foot.
Congress's indecision was surpassed by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "welcomes the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "welcomes the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their partners in the coalition engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win all the support of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators as in June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Richard D. Lugar Commission (Independent) opposed the last version.
Her spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Chapter, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other question, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have not so far succeeded in having their amendments approved, but it is not without trying.
The Goodlatta amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled to the Congress, on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations in a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the Chamber only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handle that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but they give their support - in particular the new Republicans who wish to gold their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, approved last August, called for the House and Senate to vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to lift the limit of two mandates for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is proposed forever, as does the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the annulment of federal laws if two-thirds of States are opposed to it.
As much as members have been eager to offer amendments, they are not as fast as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The cadence slowed compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed at Congress in 1789.
"Massacre but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him at Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday night on a television show, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said he wanted first of all to re-enter instead of returning to Congress.
During his appearance on the television newspaper "20/20" on the ABC channel, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The show approached his difficult return after the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing his head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified his recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords replied "soon well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of "20/20", broadcast on the eve of the release of the new couple's book entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special broadcast tracked Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the 8th of January shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he was noticed on his hospital bed, shaved head and a wide scar on the forehead.
She can use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords was sitting in a wheelchair while the doctors taught him to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with doctors, said not to remember the gun.
According to her husband, she was reading an article on the March 12 shooting when she stopped her and asked for the first time for information about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being dealt with vigorously pending trial.
"There were a lot of deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
At her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I've been beaten."
"So I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're going to get out of it, get back and get back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie suit stood at his feet to cheer him up.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, the spring fundraising organizer.
A military high school present at the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were presented as some sort of orphan," wrote the military high-grade in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But that was not respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have settled between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praises are provided to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they declare a few soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if it is sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops of the Vietnam war has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about mercy take place in full confidence among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they have been confronted with insurgents and have traveled to distant territories.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who made him spend the interviews asked in a subtle way if he would be able to get the shot under the stress of a job demanding in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you approach the subject of service, you are confronted with negative impressions," Colonel Cancian recalls when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arose, in part, from American indifference to war.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a country that is so unfamiliar with the army and that sees little direct advantage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for the Second World War," said retired lieutenant general David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of the politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
The troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The Army in the face of growing pressure to attack the rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant on the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
C"was in October 2008. She would return to her barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a beer pack.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"C" was an alarm signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her in the back, thrown down and raped, she pretends.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still on duty and others not, will eagerly await the decision of justice at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, and will decide whether a trial against the former secretary of defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not stopping the generalization of rapes within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all of whom claimed to have been sexually raped or abused by fellow soldiers. They also claimed that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says he's taking care of Galonese soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future legal proceedings.
Her strategy: instead of bringing together all the complainants in this case - putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defence, led by US lawyer Neil MacBride, tabled a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a decision of the Supreme Court in 1950, called Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for injuries caused by staff on active duty.
"The alleged wrongdoing is inherent in the military service of the complainants " indicates the documents.
The Department of Defence has refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not, officially, have the right to go to war, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely male only.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, the teams of women's soldiers play an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
As a result of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernise itself says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in conducting this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Centre prepares a case against the four main military academies to encourage a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America non-profit foundation prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of "personal disturbances" attributed to victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network (the military women's network), a human rights group.
His group tried a trial in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to treat claims for benefits for those who claim to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Centre.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
The March report also examined the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of the cases recorded in the army were tried - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the military police of rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her aggressor - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat in front of a judge at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator of the crime, which was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was rendered," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions.
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commander, "It wasn't his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was referred in less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any advantage.
Will Lyman and the other complainants move forward or not, this is a long story, says John Turley, professor of law at the Faculty of Law of Washington University.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward".
Only this doctrine that has been criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
There are decades behind the army because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence as it does.
"The chances are hard against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things only change when good people have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in their favor, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will bring together hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who shared his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been taken by murder in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some million nationalists who support the extreme right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... log in on Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by DEMOS' think-tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so many personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
The Jamie Bartlett team discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. It targeted them with announcements, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the announcements invited users to respond to an inquiry. Questions related to their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of the right-wing groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
DEMOS' study is just one example of how Facebook became the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Thinking groups, medical researchers and polytologists use the site to study all the topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I like", publications on walls and updates of statutes.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the "data supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose site name appears in the title of almost 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a means of identifying and addressing health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Mr. Megan Moreno of Wisconsin University, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits had a lot more chance of being alcoholic than those who were discreet about it.
Megan Moreno suggested that students' colleagues, such as counsellors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status would be too often about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Children's Health, Behaviour and Development at the Research Institute for Children in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized."
Facebook also has constant access to the information of its users.
The data team studied statistics on the situation of Valentine's Day, the participation rate in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national rate of happiness (only available information - digital freedom champions have for a long time argued that the site could make its data treasure available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in return for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than through the Internet, it is something else online.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study that he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a block-notes and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social aspect is not in front of a computer."
"Froid et inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Temples," he explains in front of a audience room filled with 500 people.
"With regard to the jurisdiction of the court, I regret it, because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting a hatred ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, speak to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondences for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman" said a survivor of Utoya on the Norwegian TV channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced after seeing and hearing the suspect."
He was wearing a dark costume and a blue tie, and Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at the journalists and survivors in his eyes by entering and leaving the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of "resistance", the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he has acted with accomplices.
As a result, the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some of them.
But this does not reduce the pain and confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"That would have been a lot easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing himself from the engineering and inventor of modern computer science.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in an interview with Steve Jobs recently found and which will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on major markets, is how much this creative spirit understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an improvement of organizational charts - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "illness that lets them think that a brilliant idea makes 90% of work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Crygely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds." This series traces the computer's birth, and he sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs died that a complete video was found in the director's garage.
This little-resumed video is the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast to the cinema on Wednesday and Thursday next.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems amazingly enthusiastic here to expose technological philosophies and its business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a specific answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism rises, where he seems to be eager to hear Cringley's questions, kicking him in to speed him up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely cherished aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he views as good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of IT.
It's one thing to read Steve Jobs' posthumous career evaluations, but there's something gross and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
It has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then puts them into action.
Here is a quick summary of seven outstanding Lost Interview sequences:
On how he learned to run a business:
"During all these years, I have always asked: 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'
Nobody knows why, nobody thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to provide details of his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Perplexed about how the costs were recorded - often started with a "standard cost" measured with nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour to the Pope:
Steve Jobs recounts the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack the telephone networks and phone free of charge in long distance.
The device has been written many times in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in its description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, passing a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball of different things a half a dozen times and you cried in the public phone and it would come a minute later on the public phone next door," Jobs explains by laughing.
"We were young and through this Blue Box, we learned that we ourselves could create something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know much, but we were able to invent a little thing capable of controlling big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever exist without it.
Steve Jobs continues to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night, turning to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the U.S. diplomat, the two accomplices are laughing crazyly just before the Pope himself is awake.
On his love of technology (and release of Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, at the spare parts hunt to make a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gave him a wire.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This had a remarkable influence on me. C" was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first ever designed desktop computer."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a little cathode tube. I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was going back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several times in the interview, Steve Jobs is talking about making new products on a head.
At the beginning of his career, as he settled to sell some printed circuit maps, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he should be responsible for assembly and delivery of finished equipment.
Later, at Apple's, he recalls difficulties in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big quarrels... I was raised on it claiming it took me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that would be incredibly reliable.
Of the large companies that are experiencing:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders were going to cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Let's admit that you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copywriter or a better printer, and after?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these types of people] that end up leading companies and specialized product personnel are set aside from decision-making.
The engineering in product that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product from a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have made ten times her current size. Xerox would have been Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a brilliant idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by bringing them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and that great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who have simply proved themselves the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health law opponents while the court gathers
On the day that the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the issue of political discord, namely whether the opposition to President Obama's health law would be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that would defend the case in the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question involved a trial by 26 states challenging the reform of the ambitious health care passed by Congress last year, a law that had been a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5h30 is expected next March, and the result will probably be in order to encourage the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is being rendered.
The lawyer to be held before the court and will argue about the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as a solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément's legal firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society (Federalist Society) dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial issue in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican of the Senate, and a declared adversary of the Health Act, was present.
The guests star at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing going against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fund collections of law-related and other organizations although the judge cannot be an intervener, an honored guest, or on the programme of such an event."
Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas close to two of the business's law firms, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest, was sufficient to alarm government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court abides by the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"Judges drank and ate and collected gala funds with lawyers who have cases before the court."
Their presence and participation in the fund-raising of this event demonstrates any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they too easily mix court cases with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a top-profile conservative activist.
The Conservatives also claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general solicitor of Obama's administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the level of the court of first instance.
Her critics pressured Kagan to accept the case, saying that she had invested too much in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for line aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated $1 billion market.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order covering 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is a whole case when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 planes reaches the record sum of $18 billion.
Also incredible is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a rising gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In the published forecasts on Monday, the Chicago company believes that the airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft in the next 20 years with a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.
It was the Dubai-based Emirates airline that issued this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also able to buy 20 more planes, which would increase the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated on Monday that the company Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, known as Dreamliners, a model that boasts important fuel and convenience savings for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than one billion dollars.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
Not only do they have the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil increases, said Dihora.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
Emirates's order reinforces Boeing's predominance in the wholesaler aircraft market and helps to curb the Airbus competitor's attempt to stop with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aircraft show came four months after Airbus' announcement to postpone the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus repels its beginnings to increase its growth as a result of its customers' demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing company shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican President openly beaten in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo du PRI in the race to the position of governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to access the office of Governor of Michoacán in the course of violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favoured one of her adversaries.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was in the lead of the race to the position of governor of this Western State.
"The intervention of crime organized throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officers... they got polls, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just noticed Calderon, who was in the lead of polls before the day of the election.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, who currently serves as governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former Mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence has persisted.
A week before the election a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally because of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections have aired, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the race for the presidentials, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to prepare to help the euro area out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director General of BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growth in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indigent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent the long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We're all in this crisis together."
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain point but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, nothing prevents them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan is dangerously raised in the arrow and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece resigned.
The growing crisis of sovereign debt in Europe gave rise to the fear that the global economy would fall into recession, and called on the major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would provide any Asian aid, but he also stated that bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the US financial saving fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can to help the euro area because its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a reduction in foreign capital arrivals.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to meet and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where will we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to make Europe eligible for 1.2 billion Indians, of which at least 800,000 live with 2 dollars a day or less.
"One day, they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and that they go on vacation in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many Greek officials well paid in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro area was likely to cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
BASD's forecasts of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now face "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "relief plans" to protect themselves from economic reversals and significant capital leaks.
Strong Warnings from the Pentagon on Potential Defence Reductions
The Secretary for Defence, Leon Panetta, put pressure on the Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget compressions undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, through civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon already has $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more compression will be imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditures.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating to the ministry," said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from the so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"An equally important reduction, applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and inexhaustible construction projects - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm the other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay to achieve the goal."
"These changes would cloud the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
Reductions would possibly affect combat troops, continue Panetta.
"Although the funding in wartime of the accounts of contingencies abroad is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be adversely affected by serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support war."
"The staff managing wages would be reduced, leading to delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defence would have led to a rapid decline in the United States as an undisputed world leader of the military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," Senators declared in a joint communiqué Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to occur."
That the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself has reached the highest position of the Pentagon gathering years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he faced difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks in the Pentagon.
"It's a depressed, poorly prepared and incapable of dealing with potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could " generate significant operational risks: a time frame for responding to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could go to the cupboard, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new scheduled bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new land vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Putting an end to F35's development and testing could generate $80 billion over 10 years of savings, but its supporters say that this is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at recent headlines shows how deception and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life.
The Republican candidate for the presidency Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been accused of wiring for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner went on to make an idiot by quickly issuing false claims by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violations of campaign funding related to the coverage of an extra-marital link.
And then, none of those who have experienced history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The school and university tests of cheating stories are legion.
There have been instances where teachers have given the test responses to students in order to be well looked at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lies and cheats are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a particular day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners are lying three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted a thorough research into such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths on the lie have been demystified.
The liars look into your eyes.
They don't cheat, pray or don't always bother.
Do not conclude that liars are hard to detect and hard to expose.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the time to answer.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are skilled at reading others, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more lies "focused on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people less often lie to their partners than unweds (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, the others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "setting the benchmark data."
This helps to provide a benchmark to measure subsequent changes.
Look at the posture of your subject, laughter, voice quality.
You need to know if someone usually removes his feet permanently so that you do not throw unjust accusations when you see him kicking his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for hints of verbal and nonverbal misleading behaviour.
Consider these clues as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
Deceivers can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards a exit, change their posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated breath of relief, a change of posture when all difficult questions are passed.
Questioners often falsely indicate that the interview is just over to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, watch out for your subject vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson disarmed using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceiving individuals can also use a distant language: "I have not had sexual intercourse with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or completely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" in his answer to a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember good... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be disbanded after the threat of late approval by the United States
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay approval of an pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - which arouses the anger of the trade unions while calming the environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says that it is prepared to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada stated on Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Chapter.
TransCanada's official, Alex Pourbax, says the company is confident that it will eventually obtain the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it received further studies of potential itineraries to avoid areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, vast underground water sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have reversed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although staff members denied the policy involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries of Texas.
In order to do so, it would have to cross six states.
He is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have put on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to this plan put pressure on a law to force the remoteness of the Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The ongoing Department of State Environmental Impact Assessment found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation into the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist committed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hilary Clinton in 2008, would be a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice from its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit with fear
A New York family claims that the Diva Disco Patti LaBelle launched in a riot of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point of she vomited her fears.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened little Geneviève Monk, 18 months old, so much so that she suffered "from personality changes, sleep disorders" and "the increased fear of strangers," said her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year while stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to leave on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the hall of their boulevard Riverside building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped by the door and laid her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came after me and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said, "Yes," and I went looking for her," she says.
LaBelle angryly warned the pregnant woman.
"She told me of an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to him, "what you say or think I don't care."
It became rooted and began to use oaths - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling from the bottle's water.
She said that at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who always held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her surroundings who drove her to a car waiting for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl cried so hard that she got sick, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but no response was received.
Lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damage, but family lawyer Sam Davis said that he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially towards a mother-in-law teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate Adversity Has Stopped the Economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informality increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year to be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-called for change, which has generated high expectations for economic progress, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, apart from causing trillion losses for the agricultural sector, have limited the opportunities of the State's economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report on ice cream from the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there have been damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent have suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent have suffered partial damage, the main crop losses have been vegetables, corn and chic peas.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the State's unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated increase, as while from January to March 55 thousand 053 signals were unemployed, at a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, the rate in the second quarter became 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, higher unemployment can be explained indirectly by public policy actions.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment, which is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources under the legislation approved in Congress to combat money-laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally, it is not easy for them to work to gain them, invest them and use them in something," he says.
Migration in detention
López Cervantes reported that rising unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad, in the United States was restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and second because they already have a lot of difficulty in finding work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labour market is increasing by considering the high level of serious lack of working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state is working without contributing as a worker in any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for disqualification for the state is low wages, the entity has lower pay in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of the signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, very lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI Contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, the highest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in 2011 for the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Economic Secretariat from January to June, the State FDI reached $630 thousand 697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5 million 143 thousand 312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Government's Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, registered mainly by the tertiary sector companies.
Debt
Given the economic contraction scenario, in July the Government of the State requested approval of a 3 trillion-weight credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the state congress was 2.600-billion-weight and until November no profit was observed for debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the employer sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really very poor, it is necessary to work intensively to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we need to double our efforts, it was necessary to align the effort of all and above all the good already synchronized walk of this new government team, hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as the ice cream of the beginning of the year have retained the state's economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced from several events, including ice creams, one of the main effects was a slow economy which does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level and flow in trials, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriahte, President of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that it is intended to channel the State into productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms, we have observed that we have worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he says.
A lot to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better channel the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to achieve good results in different areas of economic development there are some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, which I can say is that much has been done and the Government is aware that there is still much to be done," he said.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marijuana
A person resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and 100 days' fine for the possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Public Prosecutor has informed that the small convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for an offence against health, in his variant of marihuana possession for sale.
In accordance with the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army officers on June 7, 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker circulated in a pick-up, white-coloured pick-up truck, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle trunk and on the copilot's place a small backbag where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Center for the Enforcement of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debt to contributions to works
Social literature in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants may not be finished where to record serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk, as the Government of the State has failed to meet its obligations to provide more than 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that the total investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, from which the State has to provide 25 per cent and until now only the Federation and Municipality have provided resources for the works, so there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They must provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end they have given us nothing, even though since July they had to give us a part," he said, "and we, in order not to record any delays, have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration, the Municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the 7 million that the government had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and programmes continue to operate and this year, in order to have access to these programmes, we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had not paid," he said.
Despite the State authorities' commitment to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management to ensure that the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end, they have not given us anything."
The Court valid "analogue cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has emerged from the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue cupupre" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes required to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been set aside for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court can decide on the constitutional or non-constitutional nature of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft award, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the decree's declaration as non-constitutional, because radio and television regulations are a statutory award to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Coffel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and statutory reservation.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and to admit the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of Ministers also resolved to resolve the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project of which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the President said that he disagreed with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures to be prepared for the public administration to do so.
"I also consider that if it is being done, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of the government.
Substituting analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years and this results in better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
To adjourn the change, he supported, would be to adjourn the benefits of digitisation which implies a decision of public interest which not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "are requiring the operation of a whole system to establish, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, a group of powers which the Constitution grants to the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite their having the highly specialized technical organs.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has in one form invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress, as it ensures in the administrative sphere that the laws issued by the legislature are respected.
The possibility of a vote is analysed in Michoacán.
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of "vote by vote" is a reality in the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved either its Constitution or its Electoral Code of State or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the Congress of the State has approved reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral process to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has omitted his publication within the time limit provided for by the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state's representative for constitutional reforms, because he does not have the right to "sanction or contest them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that with the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to make the partial and total discounts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no poll record and count in the ballot file is not in the chair; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all polls may be made when there is an index of the fact that the difference between the alleged successful candidate of the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the poll is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition by the representative of the party and/or coalition who presented the second of the candidates reported.
The total voter count may also take place if, at the end of the joint count, the difference between the alleged winner candidate and the second-place candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate has gone out second, in which case the electoral packages that were subject to the partial voter shall be excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PRSP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without accounting for the 129 votes of the total 923 minutes.
His final will
Its ashes will be spread in the Zapalinamé saw, confirming the family.
The remnants of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, and Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a mass of rest.
According to his family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes be spread in the Zapalinamé saw.
After receiving tributes from the others who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the guard chapel of the boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends went.
At 17:30 a.m., he was paid tribute to the Institute of Technology of Saltillo organized by his former colleagues in the Bachelor of Technology and the American football team that was part of Felipe Bacio when he was preparing for the Bachelor of Technology.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and his ashes spread in Zapalinamé's Sierra, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considered that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, an affectionate brother and he cared much for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he was even sick of a truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: driving an aircraft.
I'm late.
With honours it was said that the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, tribute to Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Institute of Technology of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, next to the government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all officials of this service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the splanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies, located in the property of Caderyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found killed with fire fired in different parts of the body and with grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Caderyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of the road from Caderyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who went through this place observed that in the property, whose close has beige color and coffee the portal was widely open.
Looking inside, at approximately three metres, they located the bodies of three persons, which is why they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the people wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At one meter distance there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were spread over the belly.
According to data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, as there were no contact details found on site.
At the close of the property there were legends directed by one crime group organized towards the other, apart from some bullet holes in the property and in the portal.
11 captured in Caderyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated primarily in the municipality of Caderyta and who are considered to have relations with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine inhumations.
According to the information published, first on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, eight persons were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty had been saved.
Three buildings and one cell phone were confiscated; they claimed to be part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, the military personnel made a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Caderyta, detecting a car without registration plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 2:00 p.m., one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed to clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadreyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on board of the economic disaster and put the entire Eurozone at risk.
A press release from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, named on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can train the Government.
It is expected that he will present a firm composed of technocrats in his majority, even if it is not clear when the new executive will take his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly state that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well-traceed," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normally, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to levels that are impossible to support.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard austerity package required by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that has been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to move forward, the instability of the markets to place the yield of the Italian BTP obligations at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian Patronal Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the majority technocrat government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy in Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll finish his tour of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano on Sunday, which enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief summary at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now come to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will give it only time to implement reforms before the elections are made.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of Spanish is greater than that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 summoned participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 countries convened by the two countries for today's friend, at 15:05 a.m., Stade National de San José.
While both national and European champions, the number one of FIFA's monthly ranking, account for a broad record of Class A inter-selection games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Humana as the only one to have the 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England maintain intense activity in the year in national league and coup championships and fights in European Cups such as the Champions League.
To all this one must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the football World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have limited international experience in an area such as Concacaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goal keeper Iker Casillas, who on previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) has matched the record of the former goal guard Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas today will play against the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, brain wheel of Barcelona, 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the week before UEFA next to the other hundredths of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front-centre of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
One hundred-digit loan is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the coast side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five were over 30 games: Keolior Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar only has one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not begin.
The historical editor of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who recorded the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said the group is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will also be a dream to happen in this country.
It's because the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its celebration tour of two decades of work and on Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
That day will be on the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the complete transcript of which is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I spent only once in Costa Rica; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we're excited to carry our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, fans live with intensity the days before.
What is your message for your most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so long had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that their concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the biggest shows we have offered in the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We have offered two giant shows to Sao Paolo and we hope it has formed us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to it.
We love this country, we like to do surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that is how we learned it, through people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you've offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never worked there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What is the reason for this?
I think it's partly because we have nine disks and we can play more than 120 songs and each one loves different songs, that's why it's very difficult to choose which songs to play each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't interpreted for a long time, this helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting for people as well.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I believe that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock band, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together is very emotional.
We love and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunt?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of great groups.
We are very close to the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor to be part of Seattle's group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we attended a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that arose.
It is also very strange that a group like yours will stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
First of all, I believe that we are all fortunate to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned with others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to each one to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and this could not go any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what it has brought, not to be overlooked the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn't really matter to any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We've been a group for almost three years and we haven't published a record before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustration about the fact that it lasted so little and most importantly is the fact that we are still very close to Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture I think about the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The Las Robertas national group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose him for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer on-line and that must be very distracting.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbeter's words live for?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's the one who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he can imagine.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
Sometime ago...
Among the first ones I remember was Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunt in spite of the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the groups I just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if that is relevant now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney now do the best music than ever.
At first, its music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs probably represent this for me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even so we can make music obscure.
Peru:
Fujimori again hospitalized for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in the feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during her Government (1990-2000), is suffering from various conditions, including a cancer of the language for which she was operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, stated for TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasmic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he did not want it because he felt he was innocent.
It has been performed four times with cancer of the tongue, it has a weight loss of 18 kilos weight, and other pathologies, such as a severe erotic gastritis, a pancreas cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and walking problems, have listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official court, leading the Uruguayan President, José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and employers, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda of the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proprietary for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French agent Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador to this European country.
Mexico has been chairing since November the G20, a group formed from the strongest emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of the tax exchange agreements to exit the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), composed of countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004, a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
Lead moustach passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, untiringly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the bad Bowser claws, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores from around the world, has been designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopic without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", because so far successes like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the less skilled users.
Once surmounted, the most expert will be able to make a "second round" at the levels of play, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, which was no longer happening since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo looks at saga's followers and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists of the fact that lead moustachu has to go through risky platforms to release Princess Peach.
Even if I'm a player, I find something new in the movements, the environments, costumes and enemies and also in Luigi's "playable" cases.
Colom supports the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States' conspiracy for the laundering of 70 million US dollars.
Thus, the trial ended for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that called for Portillo to judge it.
At the press conference, Colom stated that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term of office "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and he had given course to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did involves an executive approach after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former deputy of the 2004-2004 period.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for the diversion of Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Public Department appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 youth at risk
The entity was born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
In addition, the long hundred jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make a balance sheet in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping untrained, unemployed people with problems of drug abuse or marginalization.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, during the electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
On the side of the President of the Regional Catalan Government (Generalitat), Arthur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act of the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor of the mayor and current municipal councillor Richard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended in the large room of Fabra i Coats.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present one is also, but he added that the work carried out so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it performs," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders were suitable for 11 of the 13 apartments of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday at 12 noon the building they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-fests that despaired neighbors, in judicial order and without need of police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from happening again.
"From this day there will be an access control," said the administrator.
Squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of that of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially alcoholic beverages boxes.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass festivals, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europe Press that as soon as the occupation of the building her business dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the invaders of the property made him unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation facility had to respond to neighbouring complaints about the noise, while, according to it, the disturbances were not caused by the clients of the discotheque, but by the occupants of the occupied house and especially the participants at the parties there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbours of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the problems were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it's been nine months since this "he forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guardia (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from the neighbours about this situation.
The president of the mayor's PP municipal group, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common and civil life that it caused the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "it must end with impunity and be implacable against antisocial behaviour generated in the property."
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to Rue Mont-ral's number 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the opportunity of convening beyond the polemic on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, in full support of the already-exhaust Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters from Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also had a numerical comparison with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (mer).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is for the benefit of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park or Yellowstone, with leashers in the role of Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for all entrance gates to Collserola.
A door goes back to the park idea, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared all by itself: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a theme of conversation by all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former elite class speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, academic professors, have come up with.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because the speech by Ildefons Cerda, that of the pastas of green houses has not been completed.
"It must start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect gave the verdict for which the title "ports of Collserola" contains a "lexic trap": it is not to think of them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it must act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualify the proposal as "intelligent challenge" with "some perils".
Perils that derive from the "uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," that is, its overrun.
"It is necessary to think of new urban planning instruments, as the current ones (referred to by the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM))) can cause real disasters."
With more attention to the question, Modol thinks that, by simplifying the slope of the El Valles region of Collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronate that "does not have to be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the mayor offers to her corporation to intervene in this "first time" project.
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the exception that allows the architects to enter the debate, but "sudden" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success", he says) that we have to create: "We, the architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the basis of the competition there is a lack of an overall vision of Collserola: "The 16 cross-sectional contests have been convened - he says - in the direction of the mountain-mer, but there is no longitudinal reading that goes and understands the area as a whole".
At least in this case, he chose to take part in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project for one of the doors to be able to collide in the program and define with that of the architect from the nearby door.
In her opinion, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the Casino Red's legal power base granted forgiveness to the mayor's brother for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founding of the legal power of the Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack of the Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic contribution so that the mayor of Monterrey allows the illegal operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the mayor's brother PAN and on 2 September the Prosecutor was arrested and held on temporary arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Department 3 of Patrimonial Offences, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained there for the following 49 days when he was given a second order of detention after the Public Prosecutor's Officer had dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadreyta penal center allegedly for having made the Casino Red owners sing with one and a half million pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the middle security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Penal Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as that of the 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom within the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Officer, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who were partners of the gambling house had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under the 197/2011 case, legal forgiveness will be granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no claim may be filed concerning the trial brought against him; no compensation will be sought for damages and no punishment either.
After the hearing of the foundation of the legal power of the gambling house, the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered at 15:50 p.m.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the order of immediate freedom which the judge has issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which he lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and seven others
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results highlighted the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter has directly impacted the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions were adequate for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contact with the soil, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that investigations carried out in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In one research, it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the Secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation may last for a few months, it may even last one year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the moment of impact, the state helicopter Presidential Major was operating at a speed of cruising and this happened on an ascending mud floor.
"This information supports the assumption that normal operation will crumble at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, TBS licensee Pérez Jácome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual Flight:
According to the air regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft moved towards the border area between DF and the state of Mexico, there were layers of low-level nebulosity.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to conditions of nebula the crew sought a lower and more visible area of height towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the remaining parts of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has occurred on a straight and lateral path.
The aircraft's balance dispersal model suggests that the helicopter struck against the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
In the place of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple ground contacts.
During the field work, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, with a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
Photographs show the sequence in which he was possibly disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with soil.
After thorough search in a larger area than the surrounding area, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact took place under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by NPI specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Assurance (IMSS) has announced that it conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of obesity of children and adolescents' that will allow to have markers associated with overweight.
In a press release, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialities Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been trained.
This team is supported by third-cycle specialists and students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvesav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (INP).
In the investigation, it is invited to participate the population with or without the right to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where evidence is given to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the sports unit Cuauhtémoc (State of Mexico West) and that as of 8 October, the activity takes place in the sports unit of Nezahualcoyolt (State of Mexico East).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Independence Unit (south of Federal District) and finally in the Sportive Morelos Unit (north of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that is to know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
As will be celebrated on 14 November on World Diabetes Day, he noted that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and history of family legacy of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that Saturdays will be applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, size, circumference of size), arterial pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic levels (i.e., people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that, in just six years, there was an increase of 77 per cent in obesity and 47 per cent in overweight girls, and there was also a dramatic increase in overweight girls,' said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from the others by its genetic history.
He informed that, on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent of indo-American inheritance, 30 per cent European and 5 per cent African, and that condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics translate into the inability to burn the excess of energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full evaluation of children, which allows them to detect if they present a degree of overweight or obesity.
She even said that the presence of dark-colored plus (acanthosis) on the neck and forearms indicate the probability of suffering from metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and the doctors write it to the parents, to whom each is explained of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they must carry out in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is high calorie intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (palms - meat pasta to corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid the cassation
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemicals of UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair approximately 200 thousand cassia every rain season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, alert Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous paving is adequate, the casssia could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on the cassis, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the yield, and therefore, the formation of cassis.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the paved its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, adds.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City in most of them were covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the small stones that forms the layer, pointed out, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through the vehicle by generating efforts, it allows forces to propagate very well into the pavement.
If the asphalt was altered, the asphalt would propagate better, the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, we put a last layer called rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
Since this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
Being the part of the Pave that receives and distributes the efforts, the rolling layer also requires that the Pave requires adequate thickness and the material it is made to be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, as they significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil is wet, the water spreads inside the layer, it is difficult to do so, which swirls all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes the cassation.
In the process of forming a cassation, he said, the first one that gets damaged is the rolling film and only later the asphalt layer is affected, but the damage is not done immediately, but it is a process that needs to be treated for the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Searcher System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassation and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent training of cassation.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow for easy repair of casses and without having to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Colombia Miss?
Analysis of factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna to fail to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives its title number 14 as a princess.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle with the fact that she was on the winner's podium, wearing the money crown and the band that accredited her as Colombia's new princess.
With the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico was mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department already 14 titles of Princess and Melina joined a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Visage Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by the Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to appoint First Princess is the fact that she did not believe with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here's the Valle candidate's answer to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it's a way to culturalize, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Câtement", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Ardor of Blood".
This answer did not first because of the term "culturalize" and secondly not to explain in concrete terms how each quoted book marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, read, please, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the assumptions launched is that Valle was destroyed by favourism.
A Bogota journalist suggested that being the preferred, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (the Oster gastronomy challenge, the vote of the public for the best craftsman costume, and Queen Mother), "it woke up the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage."
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the crown.
Although she had found it safe on both sides, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program (Comme à la casa), of the RCN Canal said that the fact that Melina was designated princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the jury about its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Competition of Beauty.
That is why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition they are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his defects in his back and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the body healthier, good food and responsible physical work.
The Queen's Preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better bodies, "but his fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in reality had not been too well known to me, left points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, considers that the error of Valle's candidate was the surgery she had undergone.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this aspect."
For this prize, which the National Competition of Beauty gives for the first time, after the swimsuit parade arose a cruel prediction that was accomplished last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina now begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, it will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite its dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
Thus it was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali dactyloscopicist went to history like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4th, a CTI miner from Cali came to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme chief of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Seven Dactyloscopicists working at the local ITC offices, this week was the "availability' tour of Eliasar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and after following proper courses, he specialized in dactyloscopic, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano we warned Eliasar to take with him clothes for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much lighter.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galton wolf, ink, a picker and a lantern, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the map.
His eye did not wrong him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible who confirmed to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the Farcs.
Looking for the print
For a Dactyloscopicist of Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliasar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know about our work.
Dactyloscopic is an accurate science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from identifying the bodies, dictators support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of those captured.
When captured, many offenders have false identity cards or do not have any documents.
We take their fingerprints and searches in the database.
The researcher said that in a flight case he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had held his hand to get out a safe full of jewels and silver.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a digital print, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of all our hands and identify the offender who had participated in different flights," he recalls.
Prints may also rule out or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drinking around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be suspected of the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even though it doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it puts him on the crime scene.
One ITC dictator explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" are extracted.
When they appear, a picker or a band is used to remove them.
Subsequently, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the declicant database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the ITC expert.
He explained that everything is not how we show in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, all that you touch does not necessarily become a fingerprint.
It can, however, be used if the necessary confrontation is made.
The "indignant" defies the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people have reached the evacuation order and have moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupe Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to enter again, through a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Pomme.
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allows the 'indignant' camper back in that place, while the other part of the movement responded to evacuation by occupying a park more north of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," says one of the spokespersons of the "Occupe Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the 'indignant' to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignant' occupied a new park at the confluence of Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which united New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church parish.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested a few demonstrators, even though Bray could not confirm the actual figure, ensuring that he saw some journalists who had also passed handcuffs.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in support of members of the movement and tried to intervene in their behalf before the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private precinct - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday during which the lawfulness of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
A few displaced protesters so far carried and distributed copies of this judicial order at that time and even delivered it to the agents who monitored the place, which caused 'some small clashes', Bray said, which denounced the fact that some officials had hit the protesters.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuateing Occupe Wall Street members or applying 'laws issued after the start of the occupation or from prohibiting protesters from returning to the park with tents or other properties they used earlier'.
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, to which he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 persons were arrested and decided on account of the fact that the demonstrators 'violent the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given orders to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to do harm to others", because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation this morning at dawn has been repulsive and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests of American workers," he added the spokesman for the movement, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The "Occupe Wall Street" officials also indicated that they do not think to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television program of Noel
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescued in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Canadian television Noel.
Today, CTV's private television channel announced that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting a doll that represents Jesus in a crèche.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, the CTV's special Noel program also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan Reborn After Earthquakes · Global Voices
GDP increased by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ended the downward spiral of early March
Since March, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, which is still prevailing after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated the material losses at $300,000, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seemed to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data from the Gross Interior Product between July and September have been used to turn the page permanently: GDP has reached 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rates.
The second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the recovery of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of the capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of unabated increase.
However, the real incentive for the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructures, use the deficiencies for zero-croitting.
Japan has mainly woken up from the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable has grown by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The Banana Stigmite
Tokyo went back to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "values shelter" elected by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the United States forecasts, a privilege that weighs as a result in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low performance between July and September for the assessment of yen.
While the markets continue their seats in the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not drop custody.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen, have to be followed," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy emphasized that the main powers are held back.
For it has dropped four decimal points to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 points in output.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, not lowering eight decimal points to 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds doubts
Papadimos said the adjustments would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to engulf itself in the labyrinth that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The sense that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional Government is imposed rather by Brussels' demands that a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos yesterday pointed out that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of a hundred days established in his designation may be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for a new election for the planned date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," said Papadimos when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not raise any doubts about his position: "We are committed to assisting the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the organizations that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and clearly said that he would not approve any letter of commitment for the implementation of the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the whole papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not release the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main parts of the Hellenic Republic do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the necessary elements to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasises Spain's "preponderant" position with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading place at the global level in the role of Microfinances".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the past two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "pesence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the Vth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and, "especially, in the one who aims to reduce the volume of people living with incomes under one dollar a day, to which the "poverty threshold" is set."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and takes on this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originated during the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "met a lot of goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum of debate but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families come from the poverty line in which they now live.
Impulsion in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneer manner" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the struggle against poverty", the work of which she had known 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," Her Majesty explained, whose relationship with this project gave her yesterday the "head of the family" that was brought together in Valladolid by the "bank of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her speech by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and in seeking solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that micro-credit assumes "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" of giving "of trust" to people "exclusive to whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Congress on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, a chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
Europe's future was not originally planned for the programme but imposed itself in the fall, in particular to satisfy the activists who judge the government's policy too laxistic towards Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, following their speeches, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave any doubt.
The idea-master of the chancellor - and of the motion - is in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face".
This is in any case one of the proposals for the motion adopted by the Congress of which Wolfgang Schäuble is clearly inspired.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Sept will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile there and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also so.
But the threshold is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country to the European Central Bank's Director on the basis of the weight of each economy, which obviously strengthened the weight of Germany.
The chancellor increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she also did not seek to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in a difficult time to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in crutches.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does sickness arrest fraud represent?
After the allocations, the PUM and the government launch the offensive on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and to give a speech on the theme - which has been going on since 2007 - of combating social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts with a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less annoyance of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, most of them want to focus on disease arrests.
First of all, for budgetary savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day's work deficit on private workers prior to the end of work.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, an employee who becomes ill would lose four days' wages, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could give rise to anger, but would bring EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of a more symbolic scope: to impose on civil servants a day of uncompensated shortage in the event of a cessation of work (they do not have a period of shortage until now, compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunchs the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to unemployment.
"Controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will repay," Xavier Bertrand warned the RTL micro on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud at work.
It has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are not sicker than they are in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (NAAM), more than €237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008 with EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% concerned sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
And so 2.5% of health expenditures.
In 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average covering some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any sick days.
Another study, this time of the Sickness Insurance , states that in 2010, 37% of sick stoppings were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no longer inclined to stop work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for health reasons or not) in France ranged between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud of disease arrests is very low in the face of black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, it is limited in scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that controls are systematic on disease judgements of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of stops of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of cases "inadjusted or unjustified" in 1.2 million, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "unjustified" cases, therefore, out of several million employees who have had a disease stop.
A figure that represents very little, for example, the one of black work.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, it would amount to EUR 9-15 billion of tax losses per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus infinitely more than fraud.
Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to correct its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said in front of Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the hundred days given to his government of union would not be enough to do this task.
"In order to continue the economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader on the right, supported the measures already approved on Monday to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage in an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and combating waste, but opposed to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the loan of EUR 8 billion needed without written assurance from all the parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says an expert committee.
Canadians live in the denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the committee demands that governments, health care institutions, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an imposing report of the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to enable assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to be made by a patient who has been deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
If Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, they report to us experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring at the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that they do not want to change anything to the Criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide assisted by non-compliant or non-consensive persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, said yesterday in teleconference, there would be more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
We recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people in the end of their lives to ease their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the life of the elderly or disabled is less valuable.
As for persons who have committed assisted suicide, the respondents estimate 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or cessation of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect an end-of-life refusal, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the area of palliative care, the committee demands that governments, health care institutions, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some health law experts have already made reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's report.
But Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to those who are terminally ill.
"It opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help to kill himself," said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appear to place the person's autonomy above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society," he says, "there are beacons and constraints."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifesta".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests in particular the data in the report on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damas denounces a conspiracy
Syria is increasingly isolated
partisans of Bachar al-Assad showed yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry premises.
Diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bachar al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, resists them and denounces a "complement" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union reinforced its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a stand for the departure of President Assad.
Jordan's King Abdallah II was the first Arab leader yesterday to call President Bachar al-Assad "out of power" in Syria, where 40 civilians and members of the regime forces were still killed.
"If Bachar had the heart of his country's interest, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a neighbouring Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, deplored the failure of Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot cope with them," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country for which Turkey adopts an increasingly tough line.
The United States, on the other hand, welcomed a "enhancing the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey are becoming increasingly harsh" in the face of repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
In the meantime, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces perished in the Deraa region, in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians perished "in the exchange of fire and pilotage to heavy machine guns in Jobar" in Homs City, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualam nevertheless felt that the country was "directing towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly reacted to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus's work, which he believed constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not fling," he added, ensuring that "the bold plots against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers in the country.
French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also welcomed the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression that he believed is confined to paranoia.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to review the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in connection with the challenge and release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergueï Lavrov judged yesterday 'incorrect' the Arab League's decision, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while maintaining support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
The demand for time in Italian markets and sacrifices
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for some time in the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today the unions and the patronage.
It should set up a relatively small office consisting of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the talks, after meeting with the President of the designated Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the introduction by Mr. Monti of a small list, no doubt one dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets yesterday, demanding time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "sometimes the markets will be patient and understand."
Its designation by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern had been raised, in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, even though he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is due to last until 2013, when the next legislation was approved.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti committed, once he took office, to work in the emergency and in the aim that Italy "become a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson from European Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, in particular called for new stricter measures.
The Italian "patron of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of serious" and another "Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place EUR 200 billion in state bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator usable with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specialized in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents emanating from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week its "serious concerns" regarding a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk, Ural, and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diaminants" in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would have subsequently cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA refers to "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "was assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a Member State has informed the Agency, worked during most of his career on this technology within the nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Crimes and anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence has declined slightly or little, according to statistics made public on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is 49% increase, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews, and an overall increase of 14% in crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased significantly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes increase again," said the organization of human rights rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be seen as a serious violation of human rights," added one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he adds, believing that this could result in an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is an inheritance from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual membership.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging site introduced on Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to enable its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes their service a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allows you to follow more freely, live the activity of the other "Twittos", netizens following the messages ("tweets") and those following you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, told AFP Twitter's spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its instinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to broadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the initiate happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the major public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were debating tweets about the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity functionality will help me follow some elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
Inclusion of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social-Democratic/Democrat-Christian Coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budgetary "gold rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus prevent possible degradation by the rating agencies of the Austrian sovereign note (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision following a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced only from a single skull, from AAA to AA+, we should pay EUR 3 billion more interest every year," said the Christian vice-channer and Christian Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria therefore responded to a request from the euro area member countries in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the "German model", Germany having been the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease every year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017 onwards, the structural public deficit of the federal state will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and municipalities will have to present budgets in balance.
The aim is to move public debt to 2020/21 under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens a new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the exchange market if the yen were to continue to mount.
"We will intervene as we did the last time if we find excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, explained Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of force since 1945 against the green ticket.
But the yen has been constantly rising since, driven by purchases by investors who regard it as a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is broken down on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro is lowered under the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This boom in the Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago because it is costing Made in Japan products and reducing the value of foreign revenues by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan struggles to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), said Noda who feared that this enrichment of the yen would not kill in the egg the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power has renewed with growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in one year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of the disaster-leading households.
But the Prime Minister found that the price of yen did not reflect the "economic fundamentals of Japan".
Mr Jun Azumi, for his part, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of his monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken the "appropriate measures", suggesting that no additional relief was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Emissions Institute increased by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) its purchases of Treasury bonds to 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts it devotes to purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The rates climb, the scholarships flange
The risk of contagion in the debt crisis always undermines European indices.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and higher growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
Always worrying about the stability of the euro area, the European Fellowships are sinking a little further into negative territory on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10h, CAC 40 loses 1.4% at 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new strains on the yields of euro area borrowings in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains ".
"Revenant investors are only too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down by 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed market concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and exchanges will continue in a narrow variation corridor until investors have proof that the situation is stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, managing funds at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalizes the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved at its lowest level for one and a half months.
Around 10h, the European currency is $1.3570, reflecting 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she withdrew after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion, including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian 10-year-old bonds reached 6.85%, that of the Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time in the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be his government's " main task".
Spain is in the market market line, while legislative elections are held on Sunday in the country.
The rate gap (" spread") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new higher historical level.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
In the statistical area, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, which is driven by household consumption.
However, Insee has revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a decrease of 0.1% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
And it's really the fourth that worries the most about economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11h, while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the shock, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the basis of nuclear issues.
The debate will be successful only if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, the demographic evolution will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless it deprives a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to curb the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate deregulation, a missing subject of environmental debate.
The accident in Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case with Belgium, which submits itself to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor with Switzerland, which simply intends to build only last generation power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but one thing, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by restarting the construction of a power plant interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, which focuses on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality runs counter to the speech.
The choice of Berlin will be to increase the price of electricity, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these negative effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be studied.
The European champion of the wind, whose electricity derives 30%, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to wind intermittentness; therefore, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the least expensive electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the part of nuclear power would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make it illusory the fine declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French refuse to pay, even though they do not show opposition in principle to this energy, polls show it.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has built an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it generates a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and makes them very job-creating non-relocalizable.
If France had just decided to leave nuclear power, it would have sacrificed many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a skin of sorrow.
Which electrician would command an EPR designed to run for sixty years while its manufacturer's decline would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be acknowledged that there is no source of miracle electricity, nor is there any diabolical power.
The development by Areva of low-emitting, nuclear and renewable CO2 solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a Safety Authority that exercises intransigence and transparency control over existing power plants as well as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same security obsession.
In a half-century, the nuclear industry suffered three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the unforgivable reactor and human fault caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two unprecedented natural disasters that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had from the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While considered by all electricians to build a power plant, the halting of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the free way to take leadership in the undisturbed development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate a debate that is also decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised at various angles - including police, judicial and administrative services subject to the statistics policy, compatible with the self-proclaimed status of France's "countries of human rights".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23rd) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analysed under the economic perspective.
There is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right on this subject.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't host all the world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by Polish lead hordes was shared on the left as well as on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that immigrants will be given.
In his program, François Hollande cantonates with banality, indicating that co-development will solve our "migrant problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electoral payout; but it is economically very expensive.
As noted by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration has animated growth and has an impact on employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace national workers, particularly low-skilled workers, with a downward pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mainly in jobs in sectors with a shortage of employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country that has a shortage of anesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows results in an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
This does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that, in Germany, an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (less revenue) of EUR 150000 to the average public budgets throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, using to deter immigrants, have had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think of European democracy
Democracy is a very precious thing; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, in order to have invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be sufficient for democracy to permanently succeed its enemies, to carry out the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner that is possible.
We know, from Napoleon the Little, that it was a simple thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become "an instrument of oppression" as once said Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, the Lights, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true Greek referendum will have had the value of double revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved away, and that for many of them Republican soldiers no longer draw in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized on the basis of needs and in dispersed order.
A white-seing to the absolute European monarch or a jump-to-foot in the vacuum of the nationalist replica: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to make cuts, but we want a common exercise, of full law, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we can no longer know where to stop listing - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole Europe that adheres to the dictatorships of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
The whole Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the piloting of the European project to popular sovereignty.
For it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, except of course lead to disaster.
After fighting for this socialist and Jacques Delors proposal for a long time, everyone today calls on the European economic government.
I'll bet.
But thinking of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by the citizens, would be a new folly and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
In order to make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" the Republicans.
The Revolution in Interest could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, genuine European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
The "no contact" flash cards are generalized
The world trade fair on the map opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% of world sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card phone...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart firm.
The most important segment is that of the technology without contact that allows to pay for public transport or to adjust its purchases by simply approaching the map of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold around the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and to represent nearly 10% of the overall market for smart card (6,925 million cards).
For the duration of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe gains ground for contact-free payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double jaws.
Carrefour issued this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed themselves to systematically broadcast to their customers of bank cards equipped for contact without contact in the future," said Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally know a real boom next year."
"Our tables on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 around the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhone of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société General, too, said yesterday, to prepare the market for an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Boko Haram Nigerian sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Alger has now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which the two organizations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two French people in Niger last January would have updated the gateways.
Kidnappés in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their followers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the collapses of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators needed to find several Terrorist-owned telephone chips.
Terrorist axis
Analysis of past calls to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, a cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is an advance, but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" had been increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and speeches or in his operating methods, which now involve the use of kamikazes or explosive devices increasingly complex and with the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a community of illustrious little interest.
Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haousssa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic Emirates in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the sharia while its militants engage in the fight against the central government impious.
The latter first target churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invests the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison.
Then the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs in the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed Jos 80, and then another one in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took care of the police's secure QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia now worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Hebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information" .
The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete with simplicity and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been increasing their thunderous declarations and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unstated - were founded.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them "to manipulate their currency", a theme that brings to an America excited by the migration of the whole of its industry to Asia.
So much worse if it should involve the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador in China of Obama and only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that "flates" the emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is stagnating in the depths of the polls, remains unheard of.
In Reagan's Picture
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he's fainted."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to this partner.
Contractor Herman Cain, second best-placed candidate, has a embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he was calling against the Chinese military threat because Beijing "trys to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has owned the military atom since 1964!
Governor Texan Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy foreign policy player.
The adversaries of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to put water in his anti-terrorism wine.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the too early start of Iraq's "boys", on its tergiversities in Libya, thus sticking to a low label.
But the attack is not that easy.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security balance, which has eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been suspicious of military interventions that lead to a landslide.
And, arguing that America must be rebuilt economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The North Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, connecting Western Europe directly to Russia by going to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, went into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with bursts.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated, on Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffets, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline which connects Russia directly, under the sea, to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together the wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a 1 224 km first tube connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
A second tube has to be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we already mention the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction site has airs of victory.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will enable gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land crossing through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to the West European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security from its supplies.
But it is at the price of a weakening of Europe of energy, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has been able to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas consumers, and whose deposits are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us organically," confirmed François Fillon by opening this gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles displayed by the Gazprom leaders, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical operation.
The submarine tube is made of concrete-gained steel to protect it against ships' anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at an average of 200 m.
In order to build it, it was necessary to avoid mines from the Second World War.
" A hundred must have been removed or destroyed by caution," said Jens Müller, spokesperson for North Stream.
There was also a need to multiply the measures to protect wildlife and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts on its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off Sweden, but project managers gave up while the Swedish were reluctant to see a Russian state society permanently on their shores.
"In case of damage, we stop the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is carried out by a underwater robot, driven by a vessel, for external observation, and by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
Of the form of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide by a diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the 3 metre second speed, he provides accurate information on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline was designed to run for 50 years without having to suffer any repair.
Gas circulation is simply driven by pressure.
It is 200 bar at the start, and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the shares.
Germany joined E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have established a joint venture, called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the total gas transport capacity to this company for twenty renewable years.
" Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to be EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has increased to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their fees, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 meters tall, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that comes before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand name card.
Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
He has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine Carnet is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves with a broken white colour, as old as by the time.
Yet, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo company, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a book of design notes but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The carnet is based on an old production technique, the muskin (skin skin) which means a varnished cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of booklet was very popular with writers and travelers.
" Moleskine gave to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, up to the 20th century ", says Maria Sebregondi, who became responsible for the brand at Mode Mode.
The success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first few years, where only 3,000 carnets were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a rough portrait of the buyer, as the notebook of notes seduces both businessman and student and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, has almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from Fnac to the small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," says Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies Moleskine's development: the brand recently launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists present their own books.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and its cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer covers... The brand has a wide range of supports.
A success that has made envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy set up in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is even twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the whole population.
Discouragement?
"No, Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled."
" The progress made over the past 15 years has been considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"There remains, however, a great deal to be done."
It must be said that for the unemployed, there are still many obstacles before they can get to employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the bach and of the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for disabled people, compared to 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that specifically complicate the return to employment, and which "are the core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help firms recruit disabled workers.
That's for objective brakes.
There remains the un-dit, the mindset that evolves, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City indicated that the interviewees have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychological or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment objective of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of... 1987.
The last known figures from 2008 show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 (and from 606 million to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
" But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of businesses from 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "How Happy"
Before confronting the Blues Tuesday evening (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have not hidden the pleasure that this friendly match brings them.
We won't even write that there was connivent between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the freeway of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made peace.
Five months after his attacker's mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian picker only has praise to do about him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, with his progress and the fact that he is a Belgian."
"I want to move forward," he says.
As for the contrast between its club and selection services, "it's all, it's justified."
"In Lille, I'm here all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Made against Romania Friday evening in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "briller".
However, without omitting the notion of "pleasing".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he says.
It is therefore taking part in further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
As well as in front, "there's Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan ( Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), remember him.
"We've crossed all the time."
"To play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomies, Leekens, for his part, referred to "kindliness."
"Fair" to fight "a gala game."
"Fair" also finds - as "neighboring" - that France has become a very high-level team just over a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a job of thunder," he became enthusiastic.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be happy to share the plane with the Bleus direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians become great," he pointed out.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You are going to report on the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento started its return to Bosnia (22h00) dam with great optimism this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, both teams lacked realism.
" At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt, the Selecçao, whose handcuffs have been on hand since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is in fact only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to play.
In view of the match go (0-0), Friday in Zenica hell, it was obvious that the games were not made.
Portugal has dominated the part for more than an hour, of course, but it has been unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk because we haven't marked an out-of-the-way goal."
But at home, in their luminous Stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there too boiling, even though the party obviously announces itself "very tight," said a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We expect a very tight game, but we are absolutely convinced we can take the top," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012," has nevertheless relativised the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The reported no-fifty of Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
No one can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk, because we haven't marked a goal outside," Bento regrets.
"We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided you're realistic this time.
