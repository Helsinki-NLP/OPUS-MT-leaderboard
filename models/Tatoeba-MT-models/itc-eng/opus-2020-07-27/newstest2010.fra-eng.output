Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American history president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
He will be awarded the diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The White House Chief and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy schedule.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides for an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth American President to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize within the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan when the prize was released.
The President does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at present.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics would forget to mention.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a degree and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate to charitable works, but he has not yet decided on which.
His program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, feeling that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all those who uphold the same values as him.
From the time of the announcement, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act."
A nature defender accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police accused the president of the association Société des protecteurs de la nature de Litoměřice as blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in return for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesperson of the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Société des protectioneurs de la nature de Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and at risk up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bennes are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their drinks packs, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting buckets at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before you find the right bandages.
I don't mean we wouldn't pick up all the waste in Brno.
But I feel that the city's second-largest city councillors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of buckets devoted to these wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is all science, which requires especially time and steel nerves.
The only place I've found for the moment is Moravia's place in front of Potrefena Husa.
Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want it, but I don't think it's very much.
Not to mention that in other neighborhoods of the city, it's not a safe haven either.
So to finish, many of my friends don't triage their waste.
Per paresse.
It makes them a trot to get to the buckets.
I'm not surprised for them.
I myself, after a party, offered to throw out a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't notice any Kounicova Street color bean.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste overflowed.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city the best, isn't it?!
It is likely that ecology and a so-called estheticism are not of much interest to Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city a first-class hockey league place that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying some extra buckets and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to strengthen my impression with official statistics after having spent a moment on the Internet.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is truly the worst in the entire region of South Moravia.
Parubek's budget has taken care of retirement and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the Government's opinion, farmers or civil servants may be lacking money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of State debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will borrow for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "That is only returning problems later, mining the ground," said Janota.
We need to know that the interest to be paid is increasingly high and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have the choice to know where to draw money.
If it does not lower social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those who are currently increasing on the left: firefighters, educators, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of higher government debt - next year there will be no more than 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will increase more rapidly and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to repair it and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of electors.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and started, which cannot be modified to possibly reduce costs.
At the very least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 large construction sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very rightly - it will gain in the dividends of the ČEZ (electric power supply and distributor), which the State largely owns and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement retirement accounts, or to serve as a reserve for the reform of pensions that is being prepared.
In addition, this approach increases the real budget deficit of 5.7 percent of the GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various damages to the victims of communism and crimes, or even the savings of housing, has declined by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, Janota notes.
The Minister will then have to save the department or, at worst, reach the government's budgetary reserve.
There is also a shortage of 100 million in the two-billion-dollar state fund project, which must be monitored online for each administration's expenditure.
The first step will begin in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota was warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed appear promising.
Just one button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American VMware company, which deals primarily with the development of software virtualization for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alter between them, you can differentiate them in staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones has nothing to do with fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a modified N800 Nokia with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is increasing.
VMware now works with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices 2012.
The snow shortage in the mountains worries hoteliers
Desert tracks do not pose a problem only to climbing operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to set up free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users travel through the offers, ask for the prices but do not dare to book for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, using the Spindl Information Portal.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams to Špindler.v Mlýn, you'd better not hesitate to book.
If you give priority to savings and the quality of the accommodation comes next, then you can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hotels offer for the moment only one week stays for New Year.
I think they're going to try and put them in a moment, but they're going to pass on too and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," said Jandura.
The Vrchlabí tour agency also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas week for the moment, it is not completely sold.
It's still free, let's say, half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some cheap last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February go as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, the interest for winter stays was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend winter in the snow-free mountain.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," says Schiefert.
On the other hand, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for New Year's and Christmas's.
There is great interest during the holiday of Janvier des Polanos and February also sells itself well," informs Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at ninety percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupation at present.
February is a little lower for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will still increase certainly indicated the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, hotels in the Krkonoše do not have to expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there are precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, time should be warmed, inform Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of the sage, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he himself regarded as very simple.
When he ended up allowing his doctrine to be breathed so eagerly awaited, it turned out that he had picked it up in carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not happy to use in the text even several times the expression "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, who is, in addition, to use the title of the speech of Bush of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by civil war as being "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
However, the following months showed that Bush's strategy, which made recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful so that newspapers currently do not speak of Iraq as a whole.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, which said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a final situation far more favourable than we could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan the miracle will reproduce
Again, the campaign commanders asked for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habit of subordination.
He called for 40,000 men to be able to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months but without a better option, he cheated the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to remove an additional 5,000 from Europe's promises, even though he had about 10,000 in origin.
This leads to the most problems throughout Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this whole process in three years' time. Obama's entire doctrine brings more questions than it provides.
Many doubt the fact that a half-increase will bring the same results as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is marked by the opposite - no one can count on, and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their leadership from day to day according to what arranges them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain purely powder in the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups in the light of the lack of clarity in relation to relations, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "ready-to-act state", which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy makes it perplexed by its voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of the war for their "promple return to the house" will bring there a true miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect confession of the US defeat.
NATO's last summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of Iran-related events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, Americans will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
For example, it will be necessary to respond to this at the time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of the troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution of this type will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only rustin for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time to plan a new strategy, in case it would prove to be a total fiasco.
Bank leaders Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums
High-ranking employees from the American Goldman Sachs bank will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced this to respond to strong criticisms about its wage practices.
The group of 30 leading leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell until five years.
The actions may be withdrawn from the leadership if they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus leading the effort to link salaries with long-term performances on Wall Street.
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense to take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank became the target of criticism after it set aside nearly $17 billion for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, strong bank sector premiums have become a sensitive political subject in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it was counting on assigning a single tax of 50 percent the bankers' bonuses more than 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel prizes in all fields except physics
There are five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel prizes in technical and literary disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two U.S. biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received the Nobel Prize in Medicine with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry price was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't have a winner this year was physics.
This award was given today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with William Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all the digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary reward.
It reaches 10 million Swedish crowns in each category. (about 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The highly awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed over this afternoon to Oslo in Norway to President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward, since he was only at the beginning of his journey and was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations war is indispensable for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is planning to resign. Klaus invited him to Château
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who will put his stay to the government because of his disagreement with the State budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota at the firm will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticized the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which further deepens the financial crisis.
President Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to budget legislation that will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies validated on Wednesday the left's proposals for money transfers and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government was repudiating the proposals of the Social Democrats that they were going to indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, which questioned the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the SDO, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by Members of Parliament, removes the savings package passed by the Fischer government and that it must, according to it, assign the State debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but does not force anything to do so, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that policies have long overlooked the "serious problem" of the "irrefrendable deficiency" of public finances.
Now there is no positive solution in his opinion.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could build on a consensus of larger political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget is faltering and that the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and Greens obviously no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dramatic truths".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is faltering and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD has successfully qualified the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman is going to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticisms of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans say that Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu's new film will expose the world much about the country, its battles and its victories.
The story is about sport, race and Nelson Mandela's relationship.
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded for the Oscars, embodies Nelson Mandela's life film, untiringly fighting the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that it was a ninety-nine-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally..
The sixty-two-year-old actor who was rewarded with a prize for his role in the Million Dollar Baby drama of Clint Eastwood in the middle of boxing, for example, has incarnated the leader of a movement against slavery becoming himself a slave, a president of the fictional USA, even even God in the film Evan Tout-Power but never someone else alive and as important for so many people as Mandela is.
The former South African man was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word that means invasion and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela recently elected knows that his country remains and is still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people with sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders worldwide.
The South African team will eventually make progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story to large screen.
I had no other goal but to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, talking like him.
The actor stated that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind bars before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to hold his hand.
I realized that when I held your hand, I recovered from your energy, it was transmitted, and I had the impression that I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pinear, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard rugby environment.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pinear was: 'I look a lot bigger in the movie'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the actual models, Invictus under the hood of the director Eastwood received positive opinions and even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety newspaper summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very successful film."
In film evaluations on the rottentomatoes.com site, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway was observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava"-type missile which was originally the pride of the Russian army gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got damaged in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as the "non-flying missile"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was carried out at the beginning normally.
It's only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the device.
It is clearly the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be set on fire from a moving and immersed vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was likely to have been by a defective "Bulava".
Furthermore, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the avalanche touched only the third.
In previous cases, engines have experienced failure on the first floor.
Although none of the test releases went without a crash, the Ministry of Defence's management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost 50 percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and therefore always states that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will take even ten hypersonic nuclear kernels of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again take part in a 51-year-old professional match.
The world's former champion, the Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend his hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will make his entry probably already during the Friday game against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who completed his 40-year career in 1998, is the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details on the form, says Coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov became the oldest professional Russian hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he has twice released gold at the Olympic Games, seven World Championships, he has won Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member since 2001 of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancelled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions have reported a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai factory confirmed it.
However, management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, so that voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December, knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
Sedmička.cz reported that the company offered a bonus 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
He will also be assigned a postponderary for the day worked on November 28.
According to Vaněk, the company decided to change the way its employees are motivated in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can place a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their end-of-year holidays indicated Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and warmest point in union comments and claims as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, management decided to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory were forced to work almost two overtime hours daily in more than eight hours.
Trade unions will cancel the strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions must take place Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the strike in the event of agreement on their claims and signature of a common document.
The situation at the plant ended last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went into a strike due to unrelenting overtime.
They also protested against the poor conditions of wages and alleged seizures.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the requirements for car production.
On Monday's strike announcement, the unions also asked that employees who ceased production should not be subject to any sanctions.
Trade unions call on society to reduce time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (about €299) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started production in series last year in November.
It produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "endurant" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the enhanced substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
This reality, in some cases, takes the top on the fact that the combination does not deal as intensively with the current variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present time.
However, the life of the sick can be radically extended through a mixture of medicines that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of side effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which drugs have no more effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Czech Republic's Academy of Sciences, the Prague VŠCHT and Heidelberg University opens the way to coping with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarborans are acting on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are an assembly of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far, and that is why they could overcome the resistance problem.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their links to virus proteins.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are made up of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a HIV protein that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of HIV caused by HIV protease, there would have been no mature infectious particles in the virus.
If HIV is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will be stopped, and researchers will explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Republic's Academy of Sciences.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in specimens as well as in its resistant variants in HIV-contaminated patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalcarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, but it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarbores, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to examine further to address the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína  in the direction of the structural biology laboratory of the organic chemistry and biochemistry institute and the molecular genetic institute of the Academy of Sciences.
Debates of the European Parliament
The President of the ODS (Democrat Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek has qualified as "doing" the approved budget for the following year and he believes that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge its existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the SDO's remarks for drastic verdict.
He said to take time to analyze.
ODS Spokesperson Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party was obviously no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to take part in the House of Deputies' support for the minority concerned with combating the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDO and the democratic social groups in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however, with the proposed amendments of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The Chamber has increased money for employees' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance with the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government as if an amended budget was less bad than an interim budget.
Disappointment and inappropriation
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of needlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to quit her duties in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota met on Monday with the Prime Minister after his transition to government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering whether he would remain in his duties.
Its disappointment with the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of ČSSD, who imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not at issue.
This is the case of the head of Fischer government and the whole government.
The Ministers appointed by the SDO did nothing harmful, highlighted Topolánek in a text communiqué from the United States.
He recalled that the vice-ministers of some departments are demanding TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign from the struggle against the deficit in public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently in the Chamber."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of democrats.
I didn't think about it, and once it's on the agenda, then I'll devote myself to it, said from the Chamber to the journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO went backwards at the Prime Minister's request.
At the same time, Nečas pointed out that the SDO would probably have voted against the modified budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democratic Members to allow the budget to vote.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, did he react to the question of whether the SDO had not been blamed by the President of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have failed.
I already knew when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolshevisation of the Chamber and destruction of everything that was positive, so Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new ČD schedules, there will be fewer trains for the same rates.
Czech railways will delete or limit from 13 December certain less-loaded express or regional trains and will instead strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will fall to the date of entry into force of the new two percent timetables compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
For example, it is the people of the Ostrava region who will have more links to the capital, the Railways will add a pendulum line.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be fewer quick trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest reduction in transport concerns the Hradec Kralové region of eight percent in total, on the other hand, Prague and its surroundings can be excited by an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and a few express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced to only a few days a week.
Among the major transformations, one can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the suburban system Esko, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distance lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main train station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will start in two hours.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13th.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million extra crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the railways next year at a total of four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate to almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have again signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not used a price increase of the vast majority of transport securities.
Changes will only affect one-day tickets ČD Net and low-price eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the journey, while until then it was valid among cities of a region to choose and was at a unique rate of 160 crowns.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, the children have been released
The rebels today removed 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including a few students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP that informed it, but spoke of the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
Hostage taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields when fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first pursued the raiders as a result of the violence caused in the settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre linked to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province was arrested following suspicions of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, these have renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the American halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the global known apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, feedback from critics and the audience was heard.
Nelson Mandela
Of his full name Nelson Rohlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvesu in South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov prize for his freedom of mind, then in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full readiness to cut off the world of football, and on the other hand because the media are driven by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are, for the time being, rather positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles in which Hollywood stars "pavan" came.
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film by taking his own words.
I dreamed of this role for years, and I was well prepared.
I have also often met in person Nelson Mandela for power - as it is said - to recover from his energy, he indicated during the first film official in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing to remember Mandela's personality and message through the film.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual.
Bringing the National Rugby Team T-shirt
The film based on the history of the novel of the British writer John Carlin is the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave his creation to the people depicting the South African defender of human rights during his term in office.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries to collect two racial groups from a long-divided population during the film and Nelson Mandela in 1995 was wearing the National T-shirt of the South African team on the world-cut lawn, which South Africa had then won.
Mandela had been long ovated fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by white people.
Hopefully the football championship will rejoin people in one nation again, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the situation in South Africa is going to improve.
South African whites, however, are skeptical as recently told in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flame in the Luny region
A fire caught in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps from the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesperson for Ústí firefighters, there are six units that operate on the fire.
They originally had to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinion and turned off the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, and according to Pavla Mandátova's spokesperson, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission package.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a nine.
She adds that in ten years of activity, Čeps did not know anything similar and that such incidents are isolated.
The electrical power supplies were not interrupted, says the spokesperson of ČEZ for Bohème du Nord Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries was not influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transport sets to distribution sets and lines traces of a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, the owner of Student Agency, will file today a complaint for defamation against three Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the region of South Moravia, against Radko Martínka of the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minute of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in some regions.
However, all regions have signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three of us have attacked and said that we are making the ends of our mouths, while we have only made an offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So there's nothing left for us but to defend ourselves.
In exchange for the slanders on the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
He also indicated that he had evidence that no region had complied with European law.
We are therefore preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the complaint filed by Mr. Jančura represents the follow-up to his media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, willing to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertising that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and that he was counting on him to resume after New Year's.
He explained that the campaign would aim at corruption in the broadest sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a call for tenders.
According to Jančura, such a way of doing so is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to Jančura threats from a Member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name, Jančura said today at Radiožurnál.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse the old habits from January.
She will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
A number of votes are already in place, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Experts are also clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for August children.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcals.
Yet the parents paid 1600 crowns or more for one dose.
Younger vaccination requires four doses.
Experts believe that each year health insurance spends 300 to 450 000 crowns in vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
So far, the state spent about 500,000 crowns per year on all vaccinations of children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Jonota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including meninges inflammation and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age from pneumococcal infections occurred.
Apart from the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible requirement for vaccination in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and voluntary.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský association indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcals.
At an international conference at which our association participated, specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad we could have imposed at least this.
I think this is a direction now to follow, said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not looking at him for the moment, said his spokesperson Vlastimil Sršeň.
Vaccination is optional to its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society for Pediatrics, acknowledges that a Vaccination based on volunteerata's shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, a decrease in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such an amount I understand the decision making vaccination optional," however Cabrnochová said.
Experts expect that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a break since it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance rather than by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release prevention funds, thereby saving on possible future medical care.
Physicians will have to buy their own products
This, however, is related to the concerns of paediatric practitioners regarding the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to purchase vaccines by insurance, and doctors receiving them in the same way as other state-provided vaccine products.
Some Members, however, feared that this would allow insurance to "decrease the amount of health insurance".
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to repay them.
It is estimated that paediatric patients will have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is an important amount.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Vol de musée"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings for a value of $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interrogated while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr.Frazetta and another man used a mechanical leather to force the entrance of the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reporting to the news agency Associated Press (AP).
AP cited a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Frazetta Jr claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the tables to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior refused to have given such permission, the agency said.
Labour defends the increase in the budgetary tax.
The Ministers defended the increase in the tax and reductions in the expenditure announced in the Pre-Budget report, despite the criticisms of opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that it was serious about the reduction in the deficit by reporting its decisions until after the elections.
The chancellor also attracted the forts by addressing low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5% of Social Insurance and a ceiling of 1% on public salaries from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
Trade unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession of which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" were announcing.
The decrease in social security - which will allow about GBP 3 billion per year - has put the world of businesses in anger, because he believes it is a job tax while the objective should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will still increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
The increase in corporate profits tax for small companies has been abandoned
Taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning GBP 30,000 per year will lose GBP 90 per year and a person earning GBP 40,000 per year will lose GBP 190, while a person earning GBP 10,000 per year will win GBP 110 more.
Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 resulted in "hard decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be weighed on the first 5 per cent of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, rejected an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in expenditures was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and the growth of the economy would start again at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP above the estimate.
"Hasn't been a chance"'
The Conservatives who will launch a new advertising campaign this Thursday warning against Labour's "debt crisis", claimed that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, highlighting "cyclically" difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to be held in June 2010.
"They presented nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
"The important announcements will be made after the election, whatever the winner"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from the coming reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals, which would result in a faster and more significant decrease in the deficit.
But Lib Dems claimed that the money collected through the increase in taxes and the decrease in expenditure would be used to support next year's spending rather than to reduce the deficit, claiming that the plans were "constructed on the wind".
Nick Robinson, a BBC political editor, said that the announcement calendar - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April next year, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda accusations, with money simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although the ministers did not publish the details of spending beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that restrictions on public spending would start to feel only in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Estudes Fiscales) has argued that the Chancellor's figures in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only deferred," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report.
FBI Investigation of "American Arrests in Pakistan" · Global Voices
The FBI investigates the arrest, in Pakistan, of five American reporters, suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested at a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab , announced the US Embassy in Pakistan at the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sought information about these individuals.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are held," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesperson said the agency had heard about the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and if they really are the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
She said that the house was already monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
State Secretary Hillary Clinton denied any comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters press agency, but stated that the United States had to "collaborate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been carried away from home by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
In the past 20 years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the report of the Amnesty International Association.
the report presents "repeats of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the June presidential elections.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's contested election led to major public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Twelve were sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claimed that at least five persons had been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, said our correspondent.
"Fausse confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, always in blood and half conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the candidate losing the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he was locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the park of the city
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform Bristol's site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 skiers and snowboarders semi-professional in competition for prizes in kind.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park, a small tramp preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the top view of the track was beautiful but that it was rather intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shining down.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents", he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned at the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last book of the author, "Why the French don't like scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for some fifteen years, and the effects of which are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a much wider and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country today.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim Spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the discussions between teachers and students on the issues most relevant to them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or the mayor (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a interest-based banking system to get a loan?
These are practical issues, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the very end.
The conservatories do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers of a Sunni, a purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia today, are a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the secularity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians (and the guardian intellectual elite so virulent in secularity) were really engaged in pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, in relation to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The Darkest View of the World
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the Great North, polar bear.
He knew of the history and complicated policies of whaling, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter, then brave, 14-year-old aspiring who had only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show assembled 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually one millionth of the area needed for an adult in freedom.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae that were growing in its thick fur.

Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose on the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians on motorcycles use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the most northern waters of these two nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a thrilling overview of what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphere nor the oceanographers can accurately report the speed of changes.
It's all right to try.
At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th, the pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information about the fountain of the ice cap.
The submarines of the cold war then cartographicized the underlying relief changes.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the largest of the work is done by hardened men, camping in cold.
Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice tax system, formed by the saumâtre water nets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who have deposited crowns on graves in Arlington
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus trip to deposit a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it happens to me, I want someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to gather on Saturday mornings to deposit crowns on the Veterans' tombs, in different sections of Arlington Ceremony's cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make every year travel, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial for the victims of United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given over $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embroidered in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, as they are not often visited as the new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children were playing and the couples were holding their hands, wearing fresh pine crowns on gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Closely speaking, he was planning silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying and families and friends were supporting themselves in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others thought to see the small black and white information cards, sunk into the wet soil for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She was a member of Zanesfield in Ohio and had taken eight hours to come and gather on the tomb of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free of... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who was distributing mobile phones and portable computers in the country, and affirmed the services of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to have access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and is followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but the authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of an American national may increase the tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that continues a "sweet" approach in order to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government move forward through concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can make the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are authorized to Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or an employee's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press member of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide further information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a major mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas programme of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a strict report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country leader to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often reacted negatively to the United States, when the two countries began to engage in better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities found an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five North Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill American troops, hoping that this case would bring about an important network of terrorist recruiters who were looking for radicalized young men on the Internet.
The investigators claimed that they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after having discovered them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Having arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, al-Qaida home and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistani secret services who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince Al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the banned mountains of the north-east became a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered to be infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed himself on condition to keep the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into the camps of al-Qaida when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are interrogated by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in determining those in whom to give their confidence.
Since the September 11, 2001, US secret services have been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of custodians, refusing entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their advertising value.
However, Evan Kohmann, expert at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups also need to pay more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept because US secret services have become experts in terms of their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following their recruitment model than so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen are calling for "action" for climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked on the streets, here on Saturday, calling for more action on the climate of the negotiators working in the palace of the city's Bella Convention Center congresses.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 but at 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists have lit up some explosives near a set of government buildings, downtown.
At this time when little has happened during the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists have walked through the city, deploying banners in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, saying 'The Earth says it has enough'.
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that travelling to his mother's native country, Peru, opened his eyes to the devastating problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change that already occurs."
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the big road -- to put the word through and to appeal to leaders from all over the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or owned pocket knives.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or owned pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to keep the anonymity due to its involvement in climate discussions, activists who wore black masks and clothing have lit up several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palace of Congress, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that demonstrators have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's representative for the climate.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English: "In fact, it's something I didn't realize.
He then went on to Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and of the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or harm the freedom of others."
Test results reveal tenacious differences between races
Last week's federal report on results in mathematics brought good news to public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more advanced in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of the Progress of Education) are the persistent gap between the results of Afro-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in WashingtonD.C. increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American classmates only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the gap in success increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average result of whites was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view over a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was reduced to only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the teaching group director Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we have raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and awkward, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I do not leap with joy for one or two winning points, said Kwame R. Brown (a related democrat), Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (basic school).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the message of test results is that the city's middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the elementary cycle end classes and college start classes that did not integrate the foundations of reading earlier into their school course and are fairly late from their peers.
Every day, the math program, for Kindergarten (Maternal) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as they were put in place in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to continue to work to provide better interventions to these lower-level students than the one in the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that NAEP's results are asking whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall system performance while providing money and resources for less successful schools in order to reduce the gap.
It's a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at Berkeley University in California who studies the city test results.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighbourhoods of Washington.
Therefore, this targeting may have political implications that hamper this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, they try to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, wherever they are from, can be assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap in success was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the Washington District, to be in competition with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, whom he considers to be a "start point" to get an increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, comes down and blinks for a moment in sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other class 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of a new student who was impressed than enthusiastic.
That's where I'm going to study! She exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them toward the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? says she's a dreamer, when she was given the low law teacher ratio - a student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit the children during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widely raised for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left the high school where they became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a hispanic of the "second generation" over fifty-eight years of his high school studies -- a remarkable success if it is considered that both of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico and Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they open the way for the next generations to play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study drummers claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an inherent need to succeed.
Many parents also set high targets for their children and found ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university -- in particular, if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children of low-income families with parents who have no experience and skills to help them navigate in the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support to these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared) , it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when students of low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi Oil obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Iraqi Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China,Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, which has been invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies went out with a stake in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only one who did an auction is lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in opening the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies opened the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability while U.S. military troops retreated, have stopped American oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, analysts say.
In some cases, U.S. companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and West Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The largest U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which had strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and gave it their technical advice, were given empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the State, has more expensive contracts than other companies and has been divided with important participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesperson of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected auction companies made offers that were then compared to the bar fare that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, having hit along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, reported on Friday by the U.S. counter spying authorities.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles thrown into their cars on Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that missiles had been fired by a non-pilot aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchist tribal border of Pakistan.
They drove a white car, headed to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani Civil Secret Services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority stated that suspicious local activists precipitated themselves on the spot and quickly confiscated what remained of "totally undeclared bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of Al-Qaida's military organizers leading the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities that wished to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistan's territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of Al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said that Somali had made rapid progress in the al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be familiar with the American general public, but that does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major character of al-Qaida or second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of the CIA drone attacks has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also impossibly killing suspected informants, says the site.
The United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he was going to resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate of allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure intervened as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said that he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States schedule for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and would force the other Governments of NATO to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a Kabul telephone interview.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military Powers to increase the number of international civil servants helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not resign but would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement," said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The representatives state that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been quoted; it is a citizen Italo-Switzerland who recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, the accused in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of mass election fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but said that the accusations of Galbraith -- which was thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism in relation to the international observation of elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged United Nations leaders to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that he was not assigned to the mission to Afghanistan, saying that this would give them greater confidence in how their money was spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy UN employment regulations hampered his ability to bring new talents.
The United Nations rules are such as I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic, and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary for Defence, Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world's great powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a midwife of 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, during a one-week visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a breakthrough. ̈
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates pointed out that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He stated that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer enormously from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesperson of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme in full conformity with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has stepped up such an agreement, a way to build confidence on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Iran has since shown itself to be far away from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's consolidation of some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set the deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to the proposals before turning to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue its talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday morning, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister, Nuri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich Kurdish oil region to meet with the Chiefs of the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delays in American plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops, from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the suspension. The US authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband have grown up with propaganda posters, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "A baby more, it is an additional grave".
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the ageing of the population, radically changed direction this summer and started encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
There is no second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good toys and spoileds, called the "small emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 years and older is expected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050, is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "so old - but not as rich, however - as the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the only child is to date, without doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist Government.
Couples who transgress this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination at the workplace.
The Chinese authorities assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers denounced the abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women of a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys and girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007, they softened a lot of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, University of Beijing, said that central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters that encourage families to have only one child have been replaced by detailed copies of regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city's government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, at home, and drop prospectus under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planner, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although the leaders in a rural town in the suburbs of Shanghai said that they saw an increase in the demands for couples files wishing a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The town of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the town of Caolu, Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to fill their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would love to have two children and are legally allowed there.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly believe that the policy of the single child is a problem of rights, Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant by the first child of the couple, said.
It's true, we're robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and had the habit of everyone taking care of us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says it more harshly.
For middle-class working couples, who lower their birth rate, it is said, it is necessary to be selfish but successful.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up watching their parents fight in the early times of capitalist China and don't want to have themselves this lifestyle, he says.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best nursery."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for emission reduction
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized allocations and mutual recriminations -- came back under the fires of the Friday ramp, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden, in the coming years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it has clarified the path to be taken.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in time-consuming negotiations, with over 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a United Nations special working group, the text does not state how many rich countries would give to the poor to support climate warming, in the course of the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be ready to tolerate.
It gives a great deal of flexibility to the process," said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington, Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on climate change in the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as the "full picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States for Climate Negotiation rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming more harsh towards China than the Bush administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from major developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei stated that the US lead negotiator, either "good sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help financially China to fight climate warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, defects have appeared in both the third-world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States complaining about their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rica delegate, said it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major issuers responsible for their actions.
It is truly a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to put pressure on obtaining a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum of political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of Climate Unity of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states "has put political pressure on the complete political process", in part by what they are now unified and that they call on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the need to resolve most of the problems in place before the heads of governments reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister descended from their aircraft and precipitated in the Bella Center building to attend open-ended meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- in which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des congrès daily -- of guitar players exhibit night shows mocking countries that they believe are betraying and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by e-mails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity only increases: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the Grand Court," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the World Conservation International Policy.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a blow of whistle will go through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of the transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
It hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will link the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The small lost holes will become thriving suburban cities, the length of business travel will be much less long, and the passage of aircraft and car by train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable planning battle, and the fear of environmental hazards, are likely to stop British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will render its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a higher-speed network going north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch going west of the Penguins to Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is over, the time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the network at high speed.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be required to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping travel between London and Scotland over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, constituting a reference point for rail revolution.
Taxpayers reimburse 75,000 GBP for the Tory orange loan
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orangery that he built in his constituency house.
The party leader who was endorsed by David Cameron to complain that the members of the parliament were "maintained", increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build an extension of oak to his second house in Rutland.
It had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not interrogated by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a control over the spending of the members. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that the complaints could not be "lighter or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the most wealthy members of the parliament, is the owner of a two-storey house in a village in his Ritland - Melton constituency.
The neighboring houses were sold for nearly one million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda at home, describing it in his plans as an orange tree.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Privileges and Standards of the Commons, concerning his prior arrangements for borrowing.
The Committee found him guilty last month of any charges of non-compliance, after an inquiry into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of his London property loan to his constituency that he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March of last year.
In April, her applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The variable standard interest rate RBS rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Director of the Ghost Cabinet in September, after a covert journalist filmed him so-called saying that the members of the parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expense scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated as "m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The member of the parliament, millionaire since his former position as a oil dealer, began to have to explain his spending, in May, after it appeared that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the expense office that it could "be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the form of £ in the lawn of M Duncan, to protest after it was revealed that he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the fee office and by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with the theft or development or use of the rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It could not be clearer or simpler."
Faithful, come and see the Brighton Advent calendar
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way of promoting the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for every day of December, using as theme, Noel songs.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 to 6:30, every day, with pasta and hot wine served for free.
The Noel songs selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-remunerated priest in the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter into an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the beach cabin Advent calendar came right after a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police have conducted hundreds of inquiries.
At least 30 thousand people, according to the police, about a hundred thousand according to the organizers, walked into the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, to reach an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization of climate across the world, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making "the political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the courthouse, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, broke windows with paving and hammers, found a journalist from the AFP.
Anti-Smoker police intervened immediately without a household.
A total of 600 to 700 people were being interviewed by the police, mostly according to the Black Blocs members, these ultraviolent clusters, which, in particular, were illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were asked "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were always held on the street on Saturday night" and held in a seated position despite extreme cold".
Parliament's party, the courthouse, quite a good child, took over the direction of Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without looking to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the speakers planned, before a candle stand with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by and by the large cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Earth's Friends, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we go down to the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the Beninese singer Angélice Kidjo.
There are rivers that are drying up in Africa, streams where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992, with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alter-globalist movement approached environmental organizations.
French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had triggered demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, with bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, gatherings of a few hundred demonstrators have also called for strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered several hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazie elected its president, Georgia denounces a "flash"
The Abkhazie elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called upon to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to the officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first interim results were to be announced on Saturday night by Sunday.
The five candidates in high school, including the outgoing president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, who condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "reports that Abkhazie has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 people, while the rest of the world views it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed thousands of people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who said he voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to the polling station in a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination lies at the heart of the president in this region to the sumptuous landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are located in this small territory of 216,000 people.
In Gali, west of the country, the district leader Beslan Archba, has given warm welcome to Russian officials who have come to monitor the conduct of the polling process.
We, the Abkhaze people, are grateful, said during a small ceremony, alluding to the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims neither to support the current power nor to oppose it.
A 50% majority plus a vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate meets this threshold, a second tour must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people walked around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the living, interviewed nearly 700 people in the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about a hundred thousand according to the organizers, paraded in the cold the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes the delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament's party, the courtroom, a generally good child, took the lead at Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the centre, not looking to get into it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the speakers planned, before a candle stand with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the courthouse, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke windows, found an AFP journalist.
They were immediately surrounded by riot police officers and intervened without a household, throwing several of them on the ground.
The police announced the inquiry of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of "Blacks Blocs", these ultraviolent clusters, which in particular were illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pedestal and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the interrogation of about 20 people, according to the police.
We have extremist groups, warned the police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the forces of the order turned to heaven.
The majority of the protesters, who came in and out of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Earth's Friends, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we go down to the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, told AFP to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The organization Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including Danish mannequin Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had triggered demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, showed up, wearing red robes and brannas boasting solar energy in front of the Philippine capital mayor.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of a few hundred demonstrators have also called for action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered several hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The history-geo comes out of the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "enforced" from the reform of the general school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific terminals.
Now the first students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "you have to get out of hypocrisy" because, he says, "S is no longer a scientific course" but "he concentrates the best students."
The ES and L branches cannot remain S sub-line, he continues, but still emphasizes: "I have not heard much of historians and intellectuals intrude from the absence of the history-geography in terminal in the technological high schools".
On Saturday, a survey of Ifop published in Humanity revealed that almost seven French out of ten (69%) disagreed with the government's plan to remove the mandatory teaching of the history-geography in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and some elected on the right.
On the other hand, the minister added that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilisation on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe sacrificed the teaching training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will undergo an admission test at the beginning of the year, which will deal with their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test that will deal with their ability to teach has been explained by the Minister.
They will also follow courses in situation during the year of M2 and then will be a first year in front of students as trainee teachers.
If you add all the courses offered before the competition, you already get more presence before the students, or more than 300 hours, has continued.
Finally, the Minister states that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "by 2012".
At Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues at the Copenhagen Summit: it was the challenge of Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Superior Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, 15 minutes each, filmed and opened to the public, found a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that caught people and gave them the desire to know more, explained on the margins of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day who took his name from the one given by the students to the fish from the school basin.
Twenty participants were selected from among the experts in their discipline and were selected for their charismatic side, he said.
About climate warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but using graphics, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will retain that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record".
The videos taken from these conferences will be posted online on the school website from December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bi-monthly pace.
Delays of payments: anger from prison guards, planned actions
Prison supervisors' unions called on Friday for "general mobility" to demand that the end-of-year holidays be paid for overtime premiums and overtime for which payment was delayed in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd Union of Supervisors) has asked staff who will not be in service to manifest themselves in front of prison institutions on Tuesday morning and to "block" them to "denunciate the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "gather in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", judging "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "additional hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first Union of Supervisors, the Autonomous Federal Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Corrections Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensure that the remainders will be paid in January.
The Chancellery pointed out at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the supervisors' unions guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am not unaware of the efforts of staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I asked the director of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not happen again in the future, added Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be low, except for senior management with the so-called premiums of functions and objectives, deplored Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints are good".
This is a pure scandal, the interregional FO union in Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until the new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those in October are not regularized in December, same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take care of personnel' money, says Bordeaux's CGT-penitentiary.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less poorly than others.
But the account is not there anyway, found Ufap's Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "successier tricks" than those he receives
President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, confided in the little Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things nicer than those I receive."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on the ABC channel on Sunday night, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate their new and prestigious holidays at the end of the year.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be on the side.
Santa loves Bo too, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "surely" a gift, according to excerpts from the broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama pointed out against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: "Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she tricked the president.
Absolutely, has it been forced to give up before replying with humor by displaying the First Lady Pearl Necklace: "Who gave you this?".
During this one-hour show, at the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous entertainer who was a strong support from Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball ball that his kenyan father rarely saw offered to him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball ball, the president said.
It's only later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims it's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to important "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors found the "lesions resulting from the operation" of the discal hernia suffered in Paris on 26 November, told Paris its press service, stating that these injuries had "necessed a repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, sought to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued within 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "paining and complications".
It's only in 48 hours that we'll have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
Interviewed by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic for this discal hernia.
The intervention, programmed for several days, had been practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a physician well known in the artistic environment.
This one was not available Thursday evening to comment on RTL information.
Following the operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for a follow-up infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured himself not to be "concerned" for the rocker, who is "a beater".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because having twelve hours of aircraft after such an operation, it's not playable, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure him, claiming that Johnny Hallyday was "satisfactory reaction to antibiotics" and that the infection was "inferred".
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, in general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operating a "small colon cancer", then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been quite commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulty of the singer moving on stage.
In mid-November, his surroundings had even to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the Worlds-2009 in large basins, released on Thursday an international title on a distance that he particularly cares about, the 50 m free swim, during the Euro-2009 in small ponds in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three records in the beaten world while waiting for a transfer.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, which ran on the record of the world 50 m free, of which he holds the brand in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the free 50 m, was the 28-year-old French who imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took off against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet preceded Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in the dark, I said that if the world record was at my disposal, I would try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from January 1st.
Originally from 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epics in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations did not serve this time to German Paul Biedermann, dual world champion in large basins this summer in Rome, records from the world to the key.
The young swimmer did not succeed in lowering the brand he owns over 400 m of free swimming (3:32.77) but imposed himself, however, by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't really give myself to that race.
I knew this time I couldn't make a record of the world, but I managed to defend my title and I did my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola awarded 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded Thursday 1.5 million dollars, clearly above his estimate, announced the merchant of art Sotheby's.
This panel before two meters long 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysia scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five scenes in the world," he explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
He was sold in one hundred lots.
The sale is still under way but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have most expensive so far, told the AFP a spokesperson of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola goes back a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his particular Parisian hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council prior to the accession to the power of the Maréchal Pétain.
There was a shadowy area of about 50 years.
When searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "succession Emile Zola" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Maccart".
Attempt of abortion of Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied an exception from the putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation the night with President Zelaya, it seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Having arrived in Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government's aircraft has departed to its place of origin, according to a source of the Migration Branch.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "get out" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a discharge.
But the President deut refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as an invited Head of State.
The putschist government "has suffered a new failure in wanting me to give up my responsibility (...), they wanted me to resign," said Mr. Zelaya on Thursday on Globo radio, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements the president fallen, refugee at the Embassy of Brazil of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has submitted us a request except for conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain asylum requests, said the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to be made as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Mr. Zelaya's departure rumors had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the fallen president, who had come to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military had strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overturned on 28 June, on the day when he had organized a popular consultation to prepare his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
He was exiled to Costa Rica, returned by surprise on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian Embassy.
If he gets out, he will be arrested to respond to the crime of "high treason" whose justice charges him, according to the putschist government.
President Putschist Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organizing a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against the return of Mr. Zelaya to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street climbs, the US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with figures from the US trade balance showing the resumption of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and Nasdaq, with technological dominance, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index was 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, found Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, did it storm, considering that the market was focused on "the half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the US trade balance figures, "which show that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit declined in October from 7.6% compared to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expected to reverse a breakdown of the deficit.
Imports as exports increased.
The great news is the growth in the volume of trade, especially for the export of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners in the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against any wait last week to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% Tuesday evening and that of the 30-year-old to 4.492% compared to 4.408% before.
Cuba: hundreds of supporters of power consist of the "Woman in White"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government had married wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on Thursday for the World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were interviewed.
Forty "Womans in White", married or close to political prisoners, were consummated on the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched towards the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, found a journalist of the AFP.
Below the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" were scanning, the uplifted punch, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents coming to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar event had taken place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Hawaiian neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to manifest themselves on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were, they, asked by civilian police, found an AFP journalist.
Police officers forced dissidents who were constipated by government supporters in civilian vehicles, according to this journalist.
Discidental interplications in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Winners of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Women in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200 according to dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain in lockdowns.
The Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" to the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
In the most rare event, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "control-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of encroaching on rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forced man kills an octogene in the knife and gets 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed two-tailed soldier killed an eight-year-old and wounded five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have struck with two knives and for undetermined reasons, one octogener, in or before a pharmacy of the 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, learned from police sources and from witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929 by a police union officer Alliance, died in the hospital after his injuries.
In or before this same pharmacy, he then took a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, aged about thirty years, was arrested and injured.
The first two victims, severely injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian died.
The other injured days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, depending on police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and would have been hospitalized "in shock" according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled to the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passersby, apparently at random: one 30 and one quadrantaire, the latter grossly.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two knives to slaughter that he was carrying in a cross behind his back, explained in place a head of the Alliance union in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, according to testimony collected by the PSA, tried to control the forced labourer.
I've seen a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept her.
They didn't get there because the guy was tough, Alberto, the server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Still boulevard Jean-Jaurès, in line with No.61, two municipal police officers, their leaders, tried to intercept the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers have come to tell me there was someone injured outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, put him in a security position, and I saw a very important wound to the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, 30 years old, was injured with a knife wound.
They are the national police who have arrested the man without identity papers.
Nanterre's Public Prosecutor's Office seized the investigation of the Department of Judicial Police of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The coroner was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source has not ruled out that it is interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to master him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all forced into this species whose forces are engaged under the effect of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the abandonment of prosecutions
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of prosecution against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, counsel of the director of the "Pianist", denounced three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second district of California with serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I demand that the charges be dropped here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- dead since -- would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedural fault.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wantedd and wanted" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the prosecutor's very mouth in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "false" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court would refuse to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argumentary.
The prosecution reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no discharge of the charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski would appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, prior to his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
The Deputy Prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the hearing."
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to flee?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "demands favor to the court, while disregarding her authority."
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out that there were other alternatives to the flight.
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the abandonment of prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also demanded, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September on American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad chalet, awaiting a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends undirected, restrained by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended undirected Friday, in a trumped market between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while Nasdaq, with technological dominance, abandoned 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, noted Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think it will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend has been supported by the publication of better than anticipated economic indicators, which "contributed to improving market opinion on the strength of economic recovery", summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second month of arrears and much more than anticipated.
In addition, the confidence of American consumers rose significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been hampered by a further rise in the dollar, at the top of two months in the face of the euro, which "pulls down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of the Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and that of the 30-year-old to 4.497% on Wednesday night, compared to 4.492% on the day before.
Miss Monde's election again in South Africa
After a month's journey through South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss Monde are preparing to cross the last line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already booked their ticket for the half-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta du Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo de Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma du Canada were elected Sports Miss or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape was extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and experienced so much!, Miss Sierra Leone calls herself.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17h00 (15h00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to restore my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova points out in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian girl, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "the landscapes to cut the breath in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood stars.
It's the dream of every woman being crowned the most beautiful in the world but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to go home with the crown, throw Miss India with a big smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will show up in traditional costume and of course in swimsuit.
The show will be animated by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a committee member of Miss Monde Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knew how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
The candidates did as last year did a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time on bicycle, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with the South African President Jacob Zuma who held their hands.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone notes.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the fate draw in Cape (southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been dating people I never thought I could get close.
I'm definitely coming back for the 2010 World Cup, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport where he had to go to his father's hair hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong, it is happening very well, told the press David Hallyday at his exit from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1300 locals (21H00 GMT).
The son of the singer, the relaxed air, assured that he was going to go "very fast" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a consequent infection to the operation of a discal hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for a subsequent infection to the operation of a discal hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laetitia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade was educated to attend a school show, and found a photographer of the AFP.
The head of orthopedic and traumatic surgery at the Pitié-Salpétriere Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would go to Los Angeles on Monday to the singer.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the Monceau International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were fired, said Mr. Camus.
I have heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday was "part too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem with this trip, and that surprised me, since I had two discal hernies myself, he added.
Not before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "go without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the arts.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before his death in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to rejuvenate a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a sulphide-repute doctor, who has been sentenced on several occasions by justice, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scrupulously" pursued "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well conducted" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a tour resumed on January 8 (at Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and sum the New Centre no longer using its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the OPA's attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the e-party of the Giscardian, by holding him back from using him on no support, subject to judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy before the NC National Council on Saturday.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP) who claimed ownership of the UDF mark for having been the first to file it to the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to let themselves be plundered, came out of his silence in order to initiate a remand to the minister and the MP, so that they no longer use the acronym and transmit the ownership of the trade mark to them, subject to judicial prosecution.
Over the past few days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement of +recover+ the UDF acronym, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it was good to have your militant material tracked on and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, the slogan +the UDF of today+, also found the mail signatories.
As you do not know, you have no right to the use of this acronym, explains the UDF office which enforces the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium and (on) the website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (la) mark to his legitimate right-holders".
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, preventing the signatories.
In their mail, they state that the UDF "is a fully-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UMP".
In their view, the New Centre has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recalled that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, "when he filed the trade mark", he was not "more adherent to the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
He is scandalously and fraudulently benefiting from the abscess of deposit of the UDF acronym to do so on his behalf.
This indelicacy is becoming a crime, they denounce, before ironing on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which we are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as accused by the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian for the spoil of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his pictures of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment and 375,000 euros' fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter broke up while holding the reins of the term of the L'Oréal cosmetics.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The principal heir and shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any event not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The designated physicians will be required to report by 10 March 2010 in particular if Liliane Bettencourt has been in a weak state and at what time.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'm going to talk to her about it, she said at the end of the hearing that Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For his part, lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old lady that we have to protect, said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been prosecuting the criminal charge against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist at all, who accuses her of having used her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleas at times turned to the large family breakdown Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters from her client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to lawyer: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to him since his wedding."
For its part, Nanterre's Public Prosecutor's Office once again felt that the complainant was not eligible for action, especially since a guardian judge had refused in recent days to grant her application for a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in its place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than ten years, the attitude of managing large companies towards their employees has been a reminder of the position of companies facing consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a matter of making employees join "values" determined at the top as it once was, of imposing products thought by factory technicians to consumers.
By putting the client at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has handed over the procurement strategies to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preference factors comes back on a regular basis!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilisation seriously undermines the development of all the company's intellectual functions, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires employees to make a commitment that authoritarian management revenues are totally contrary.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be to put the employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as the client.
Any relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Internal opinion surveys – like Orange's questionnaire to his employees – will they encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First because I could see that, in the face of a new situation, all structures finally arrive, after many diversions, to do priority... what she has always done.
- Then, because of authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old life-threatening theory, recently reactivated by the "uniane-neurosciences" and widely disseminated, on their own, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leviers" (sic) of the executives' engagement, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr comforts leaders in a position of mechanical governance, inadequate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, involves adopting a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists of incorporating, in any reason or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of achieving some of their dreams, ambitions, projects.
Currently, only the studies from the Reasoning Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business based on a pre-determined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life plans.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and restore their management of human resources "to the place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: The "Just War" is worth praise right to Obama
The U.S. right greeted the speech given on Friday in Oslo by Barack Obama, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the United States' enemies.
The Conservatives, who had cut off the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former vice president candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, a woman in the right wing of the Republican Party, at the U.S. Today daily, adding that she herself has addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that have just been published.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over there, she thought.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done very good work in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this whole-of-historical speech, said Mr.Gingrich, interviewed during the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a potential candidate for republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen "a president on the left" remind members of the Nobel Committee that they would not be free and could not give a peace price if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's former pen in Washington Post, Obama said "a very American speech."
In addition to being present in "citizens of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president", reminding the Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Mr.Gerson.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a Bush faucon, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "mother, ampoule and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the President, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When war is wrapped in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the centre-left press remained laudable at the President's seat.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was prematurely attributed to Mr. Obama, qualified his address as "superproduction" even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the daily Californian fires.
Obama "spoke the speech he needed," said the New York Times, judging him "both dark and uplifting."
Roads: Three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three rounds of negotiations-marathon, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employer organization to remain until the end, arrived on Friday evening at an agreement that ended the word strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" of this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators left on Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement at the end of the morning.
And the same if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had shut the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting started at 11:00 to make everyone agree and the text was signed at 6:00 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very harmful to businesses" and "it was to fear that he would be disrupting the holidays of the end of years," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9 per cent for the highest (international transport).
At the hourly rate, for low wages, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're leaving very far, said Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we're going to give orders to our militants that there are no blockades, no blockades of refuelling centres.
But we can still have a few recalcitrators who aren't happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, praised "a good deal", even though it was "difficult to grant increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be about 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the re-evaluation of travel costs of 3%, and the holding of general road transport status in the first half of 2010, which will include addressing the question of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of €100 million in the employer's expenses" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending financial law for 2009, which was voted on Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical terms".
TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply in the first instance to companies that adhere to the organization, and in the second place to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible", assured Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dope market", as the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the dinda eaters of the next wake, unostra deplored.
For the Other, the agreement is likely "to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector within the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, disgruntled trade unions of RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A, France's largest urban transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday to the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP management left them on their hunger as to their request for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important Christmas shopping weekend, there will be only trains between 10:00 and 8:00 p.m., due to a two-on-one train on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and a four-on-four train outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change train.
Lafayette Galleries, which await 200,000 customers every day, were delighted that "RATP is making efforts to serve large stores".
The West Through the RER is the Parisian agglomeration.
The short RATP section of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains circled at peak hours, and almost no copper in hollow hours, as expected.
Like Thursday, there was no copper on the quays, the Francilians were organized.
Thus, in the early morning, the St.Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially due to the absence of colleges and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbabina explained that he had risen "an hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive at the hour".
The Saint-Lazare station was not known for saturation, the SNCF, which had provided for an officer and law enforcement officer.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare train station to reach the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "magres" by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, which claim a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its parentheses premium proposals in the same way, pointed out the CGT, stressing that the management "was not careful to solve a problem when road and SNCF were done".
A new meeting is planned on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," said RATP.
Which also made the trade unions say that the company "was mocking the users of the weekend."
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded a headquarters establishment committee in Paris.
It was then that the management, who refused to discuss during the strike until then, had suggested "in the interest of calming down" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to extend to RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros vary (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to millions daily of travellers.
The RER drivers, all in second part of the career, reach 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for the time-drinks, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurde party, a heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court declared Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurde party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the government's task, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "framework of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the President of the Court of Hasim Kiliz told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified seven-voting majority was required to declare the dissolution, said Mr. Kilicç, adding that 37 party officials, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity to Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a proceeding initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Number of observers believe that the DTP is the legal policy window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court then comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to cut the Kurds' support for the PKK and end the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had argued that dissolution could lead to increased tension in the south-eastern Anatolian, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Upon the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeast town populated mostly by Kurds.
The forces of the order fired tear gas and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones, with leaves.
A hundred people were also shown in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the Justice decision was going to "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurde, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
In principle, we are opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the government's democratic openness, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
One can of course expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
Early snow may fall
What Wolfgang Braubburger wants is a tough winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sanding service (ESF) makes it clear that it is not to haunt the citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn how to master them.
And according to meteorologists, this could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles are ready to tackle snow and ice.
The EDF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Braenburger explained that as soon as he went snowing on the city of Frankfurt and that the temperatures fell below zero, large sablading vehicles traveled 20 main routes (called itineraries A).
This includes highways, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Fire-fired access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and roads are also included, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road shall be salted with a road fondant that adheres well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
This is why the FES service starts at 3 am in the morning "so that roads are cleared when daily migration begins".
That's where it gets harder, it's when the snow falls at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, we are told by the road clearing and sanding service "because no car is willing to let the salad vehicles pass."
Then, if it doesn't snow anymore, we deal with access roads and dessert roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Sideways and lateral streets come last.
Mr Braubburger is well aware that this still causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES foot team sets out to prioritize the areas deemed dangerous and crossings.
In the case of bicycle tracks, FES services are generally unable to deal with this.
Mr. Braubberger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the condition of bridges between 22 hours and 4h30.
As the mirror forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salad vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
Police may also use this special service in cases of need.
Dinosaurs are blushing.
The Tawa foundae looked like other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipede was about 2 meters long for 1.50m tall, its posterior limbs were powerful, its long skull was filled with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with scarves and had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, like the Sertling Nesbitt report from Texas University in Austin and his colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the land emerging from the supercontinent, the Pangee and was located toward the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa illuminates the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the ties of kinship, distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt began searches with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch website north of New Mexico
Randall Irmis from Utah's Museum of Natural History and member of the search team tells that they sometimes came to find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories regarding the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers baptized her by the name of Tawa according to the word of the Indians Much for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bone.
Not all Paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, however, he says that it allows to confirm certain theories regarding the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth approximately 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making the classification of all the first dinosaurs very difficult.
The experts ask about the time when the sauriens were divided into three major groups of evolution: the theopods (carnivores) that include the tyrannosaur and the velocipator that appeared later and of which the birds, the sauropods, the quadruped long neck, and those that are related to them and the ornithischi herbivos that are part of the species such as triceratops and the stegosaure.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first therapists.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, S. Nesbitt said.
Researchers found clues that the Tawa found small airbags in its skull-level bones, as well as the birds that are the descendants of the theorems.
These small air pockets facilitate bird breathing compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa found the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest airbags with small airbags in its bones.
As the related line of huge sauropods also had airbags and light bone, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the sauriens had appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, namely all the emerging lands that formed the Pangee supercontinent.
This appears to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists has also discovered the remains of two other theopods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, advancing researchers.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn says that there is an even older species, the silesaure, which lived in today's Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong vision because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era while they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, remains a mystery today.
At the time of Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and many other sauriens.
Towards the end of Trias the dinosaurs spread across the globe, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between Trias and Jurassics.
Such success, however, is not everlasting.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There was a massive extinction where dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or at that time, dinosaurs were better suited and they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favouring the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which had been in the shadow since then: they were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors at the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
There are courses officers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
Evacuation by the casino police at J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt made waves on the whole planet.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with protest students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, the police requested by the university's steering committee conceal the intervention of the police.
Last week, the president of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in a strike after walls and works of art had been barboiled with graffiti.
Five students were injured during evacuation.
The signatories felt that degradation did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commander against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention solely on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegate and criminalize protest" and tries to make the reasons for mobilization forgotten.
The University's Steering Committee was thus excluded from the discussions that would be essential.
Course officers require immediate suspension of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
Young people from the Verdi Service Sector Union and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) are supportive of students.
The protests are merely the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, the regional secretary of the youth of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Sciences of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) , she took action and caused the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and site degradation is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the Aksuelle Stunde television show.
We understand the meaning of protests but do not accept vandalism, said the CDU member of the Peter Beuth Regional Parliament.
Parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (Di Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the party La Gauche (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the students' arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion for the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions for police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
For a long time it had been known as a secret city, forbidden to western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place for searching for secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
There are important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics.
As of September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, the place of French science – with academic institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Strategic Collaboration Protocol".
The signatories were Moscow's deputy mayor Juri Roslkak and Zelenograd's Anatoly Smimov Prefect for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Head of Project Section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will start in Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
It is located at the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the big Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika companies.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd ( Literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centres are implanted.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The extent of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
S21, it is much more than the sinking of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Bade-Württemberg, into a hopeless chaos of construction for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 80s.
The line-head stations, with tracks ending in the middle of town, were renowned at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that made effect of the brake shoe of the modern rail traffic because it took a lot of time to move the locomotives from the rear forward.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what to do.
That is why the line-head stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
Also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is located about halfway along the Trans-European Magistrale of the rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from which the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the line-head stations no longer really pose problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with highways and car-pilot at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new intercity line to Ulm.
It was taken away by regional and municipal policies.
The railway company is a party because it is the taxpayer who costs the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphics of the planners generated by computer – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of people to whom it was attributed - and it is typical of the 80s - a huge growth.
At the time, there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening the traffic of goods because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other rail projects.
For example, €6 billion will be included in the Souabe project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade, this money will be lacking for other joints and bulking points in the network.
The Ministry of Transport lists sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the 180-kilometre Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 this line has been built slowly.
It would be really urgent to support the mushroom here in depth.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international goods traffic, which is in the heart of Europe.
Government Examines Judgments on Airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility of appealing to the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Tribunal concerning the ban on air flights at night.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to review from a legal point of view the judgment rendered by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction project of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport would be carried out.
The authorization to land for 17 aircraft between 23 and 5 hours in the morning, as envisaged by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air nuisances.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticizes this time frame and attempts to pressure the government representative to issue an appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel parliamentary group invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be conditioned as a total failure to a given word.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep his word," said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the Electoral slogan of the FDP "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's complaints that the Government of the Land is still trying to authorize night flights by using "advocacy and roubles".
It takes time to carry out a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely flawed.
U.S. banks repay the aid allocated
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, derive from their ties towards the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it fully reimbursed the Treasury $45 billion (more than €30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to rid themselves of imposed restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of funds, such as the limitation of bonuses to managers and the regulation of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors who had paid it 19 billion dollars of fresh money.
The remainder of the sum comes from the bank's funds that are well filled through the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America specifically thanked the U.S. taxpayers: the capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult time.
The banking institution had assumed its ability to redeem Merrill Lynch's investment bank at the highest rate of financial torment.
The Citigroup also plans to raise money in financial markets to free itself from the state's guardianship.
The U.S. bank could thus launch an increase in capital of $20 billion on Thursday, the CNBC chain citing the banking community.
Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Eventually everything happened faster than expected.
Only two weeks after the limoting of the current position of editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German chain ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wished to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs ZDF's Berlinese writing, was the great favourite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further harm the ZDF manager Markus Schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 Commission members on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council supported Brender's reconstitution and 7 others voted against. Brender's removal by vote was a well-predicted failure for Schächter.
In fact, the CDU, which is a majority on the Board of Directors, had already heard several weeks before the vote, did not want to reschedule Brender to his position.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly estimated lead editor by referring to the fact that the rate of listening to ZDF's information emissions had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests still took place, almost until the vote, flogging the growing political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had entered the debate and considered Koch's way of acting as an anti-constitutional one.
But it's not going to do anything.
Peter Frey, who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, teaching and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked in the Südwestfunk (Rhénie-Palatinate radio organ) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German national newspaper).
In 1983 he became a editor in the ZDF first in the news magazine "heute-journal" (present-day newspaper).
Then his journey continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the associate of the editor-in-chief of the time; then he corresponded to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was the chief and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (a bimonthly information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then the editor of the Berlin edition.
After Brender's misfortune, while he had just been elected a journalist of the year by the magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent to the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the employer's proposals could not be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political figures from the supervisory commissions of the ZDF.
Peter Frey, Brender's probable successor had skillfully acted with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission with vehemently in his decision to limoger Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as could the Board of Directors elect it without being suspected of placing a political partisan in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as left liberal.
Large cleaning in university studies
Part success for students: After one year of school strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliating: during a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the rectors conference, an agreement was developed that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to come to the end of their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the exams: a single examination should allow the study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will need to be recognised to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and institutions of higher education wish to facilitate recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also undertook to organize more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master branches.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of Länder and the rectors of universities have constantly spoken the phrase in fashion: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Each module should normally be completed by a single examination", which can be read in a document of about 30 pages on future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, states that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, we should be able to stop the deraping, which had a significant impact on studyability.
In the future, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
The modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if you cannot avoid this feeling of suffocation that you sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition considers that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and flexibility to enable and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that in 2015 only all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programs were not too busy and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
To date, Rhénie-Palatinate is the only country to have agreed to provide more means for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities need to organize tutorialsand strengthen educational guidance offices as well as review offices and the international relations service
The Länder and universities are planning a budget of EUR 10 million for this purpose.
In early 2010, the Government wishes to present an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
As a result, only one exam is required to complete his studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, the more it is necessary to ensure recognition of notes from other higher education institutions and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students indicated that he would like to see the organization of education policy no longer happen in the future "last closed doors" of Ministers and rectors of universities.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as individuals should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education are supported by the Chair of Delegates of the Rector Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us" said Thursday at a meeting with Ministers of Education of the Länder with which HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the education and science union (GEW) decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. He demands the right and the opportunity for each Bachelor to enroll in a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder ensure today's Bachelor students, that there will be enough space tomorrow for Master studies and study conditions as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education have not referred to the possibility of lightening access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematizes in brevs of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany that gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a German and English teacher in Bucharest and subsequently a collection manager in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the chair very coveted of poetry from Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum of Hesse at the artist's house of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He talked a lot about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a convention in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deforming mirror of your safety records".
Obviously destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized his fellow German-Roman writers as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer as an informer for the security policy police.
Söllner received the German language price in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The recruitment tests began insidiously in 1971.
I am, therefore, concluded by Söllner, "someone who has not been able to resist security intimidation tests."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honouring of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary brittles with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and the base of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victims.
In his own security file, IM Walter played a role, ensures the specialist of literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
"He was able to get it out of all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however, the belief of a former dissident of his collaboration with Romanian secret services is not in fact so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had previously written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of its own file.
It can be assumed that the victims have speculated and sometimes guessed what real names were last hidden by the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter borrowings.
On the contrary, Germany, in the meantime, where consulting the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Security files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been continuously counter-argumented and braking in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has been rather delayed since.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of Temesvar Security who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller, expresses itself in a three-detailed manner with respect to the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power was thought to be able to express itself here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many issues are bound up with the Söllner case as they occur so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now ? Who has been swept away ? The heavy reaction of the auditors, in Söllner's testimony, lets hope that the follow-up to this chapter will be more defined by a thirst to know that only by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Tumults at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived there, shot at four pins coming right from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross mounted less than a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, let himself be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our fiftieths could have taken the wheel himself - he had not drunk alcohol and was not drunk of happiness either.
He had had a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because now it was gonna start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just begun three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth of the final," that is, in the league of the champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. This will be a brutal battle not to return to".
The "great work" awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is about repeating in Mainz the results of the league of champions daily.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have surfaced after the three shipping goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing on lot
The eighth final finish of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23.24 February/ match return 9/10. + 16.17. March) will be fired on December 18th in Nyon.
The joy of the entry to the fulminating function of the successor of Babbel was therefore moderate.
And joy was not moderate only in those who had been lucky, who had passed on to the professionals of Stuttgart destabilized, a smooth motivation and pleasure to play.
I saw the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be braver, explained the "soul plumbing" – Gross - the recipe for the success that sounded so but that it did no more effects with the Babbel healer.
He triggered a certain magic, consa Jens Lehmann - partisan of Babbel -, "in the football when there is a new impulse there are sometimes things that we would never have believed possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, advances to the rank of the best player thanks to her dynamism, tried to describe the "probial "fresh wind" phenomenon and the working method of the new leader: "It's someone who moves to action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But Babbel apparently missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't been running yet, warned manager Horst Heldt
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Like Gross, players and managers are careful to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated defence and weakens Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before having had a bad wake four days later at Leverkusen with 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't had a hard time yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th birthday did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home win for three months, it was from the events of the weekend that a television interview by the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann had rebounded just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, countered Heldt, in response to the bitter criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the management of style weakness and said that he had decided to change his coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann also saw as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of freedom after the games was eliminated.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a pure egoism" and highlighted the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life these two quadrangles.
In any case, they agreed for the rest, i.e. that without the group's prior work by the coach replaced, the strong sport and combat representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in the success" retorting Heldt and Lehmann in the choir – and even the man in the plastic bag aquiesça.
World heavyweight championship
Warm combat in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger was constantly causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko and the world champion.
But after twelve difficult rounds, the Ukrainian defended its title as world champion of heavyweights according to the WBC federation.
At the same time as the judges, he imposes himself on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a single-point victory for judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defended his title with honour since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had twice won the World Championship of WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, out 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, confessed twice his defeat because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko sought to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, on its left side.
Johnson, 11 centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's hits, thus causing Klitschko to play against his dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried mostly to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and in gestures his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital of Switzerland before the fight.
He insults Klitschko the treatant of "vila zombie" who "is not really capable".
On Friday's weight, the champion could not help but provoke Johnson by dropping his nose-lit sunglasses "in order to see his eyes."
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko again imposed on himself in his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a nearly four-year break, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his WBC belt that he had previously left without a fight.
This year, defending his title as a champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," said Klitschko to explain his quick return on the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was due in September.
It would appear that his promotional company is now planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack on the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Gutenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and La Lefte parties (Die Linke) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following consideration of the latest information on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formed a contravene" on the murder of two tank trucks last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the ARD Chain information show "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given to the full disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Gutenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the strike was in fact not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two major Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the US air attack that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Commander Military of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left have asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday, to speak to the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the Verts Renate Künast party are of the opinion that Ms. Angela Merkel should make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan federal government's policy if the chancellery, the army and intelligence have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesperson categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellorship did not in any way influence the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, more and more voices were being made to express doubts about the real reasons why Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert had been referred to by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Gutenberg about the attack of tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some disturbing details from the Minister.
However, in the midst of the two senior officials, they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a military police report.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reported that Wichert would have in the meantime asked in a mail for clarification of the facts.
Up to now, he has not received a response
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these allegations and referred to the Federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, which was to be set up the following Wednesday in order to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dream
Some people see, wake up, images and hear voices that no one else can see or hear.
There is only in the case of mental patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything goes very well.
When we lie in our dark rooms, we can easily indulge in the worst dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who wakes up makes the experience of a state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in patients with mental illness or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at issue: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the limits between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even though the trigger and effect are different, the visions of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the prophet of New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychosis and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when balance, neurotransmitters of the brain - first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achethylcholine - is broken and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earthly Attraction Force no longer has power over the person.
From antiquity, philosophers and physicians have always focused on the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T becomes a character of a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions with creative colors.
Earth attraction no longer has power over it, it plans at the height of the ceiling.
He's feeling a bit.
Behind him creatures of wild devil, screaming, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They follow him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, feel pain throughout the body.
Tonestrating voices, foul, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from its stereo chain, actually a loop and the hook attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He goes up on a bell and passes the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop goes away.
That this serves as a lesson for you, shout the voices in a heart to pull out the tympan. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first of 20 years soon.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manico-depressive, it takes medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics it is the most frequent disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitation, which makes them suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, sexual madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is drowned under the sensations.
Just like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis focuses on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatric department of the Heidelberg CHU (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrene is at the heart of the situation, with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Experience once in his life of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
The delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of life takes place within a real framework.
Why does our brain make this kind of cabrioles, it's always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals concerned have severe brain damage.
Neuron maturation of the brain is assumed to be disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the abnormality of the neuronal system occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience may be a psychotic trigger, if there is, however, a predisposition.
Likewise, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses as they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms up.
What's crazy, we're told psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of viewpoint.
Kasten has been gathering reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Mind".
The hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychosis but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, as well as migraine, epilepsy, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Halucination, according to Kasten, consists of souvenir fragments that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently cooled; when our brain heats but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as a brain injury or a psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants recognize having experienced hallucination at least once in their lifetime.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. was 16, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania before and going to high school.
A young girl all to make normal for real.
If there were no images and voices.
During recreation, a young boy, thin, long-haired, sends him the word.
When she answers her friends, they look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this nice young lady.
I'm crazy, she's wondering sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally scary.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while she is invisible to others and the teacher is clearly explaining equations in the table.
At night the apparitions are generally scary.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that arrives too rarely and well too late, she cannot often make the distinction if she is awake or already dreams, if the images she sees, the smiling faces or the girl with bloody steps on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, shout at these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd take it for a fool.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her trunk last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Folly is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is that they have hallucinations after a certain time.
I assume that the brain is not quite busy, so there is animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned when she was 13 years old that the man she called Dad, since she was of thinking age, was not her real father.
These are the same brain zones that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form into the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to treasure hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, there is unfortunately a quick tendency to take imaginary experiments for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease that also contains something positive, a creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of experience called oniroid, a particular form of change of consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroid vecus are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that it cannot differentiate from the dream even when it is awake.
The omiroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathies, they experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of himself and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental limitation between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
In fact, this is an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, an organizational capacity that is given to us men, not to shade in the negate of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichs Peter Cornelius Classen, a historian of art, also describes his honourable experiences in his book "Changment of Heart" as a saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscious part of a journey several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by transplantation; during that time, his body was condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world that he has created of all rooms, visits foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man allied in a rail sanatorium, a robot to his head watch over his health.
He lives at an average age among nobles who manufacture blood-based narcotics.
He is removed by a Greek motorcycle that takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It completely absorbs in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these inner trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, writing in describing what he has lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real life.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the ironioid delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychiatric experiments show how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, concluded psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
Early snow may fall
Burda
At 27 years of age, the children will follow up with the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to resume the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, editor Hubert Burda sees his society in the hands of his children
Both children will inherit at age 27 and are firmly committed to integrating society, Hubert Burda said, 69, in Spiegel.
All details have been fixed in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
They will also need to see if they are capable of this.
It is not possible to impose its children on 7500 employees without knowing whether they have the capacity to take care of it.
It would tear children down as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position of President-Director-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
As a result, he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a family member who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children were 19 and 17 years old respectively, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have been driven by capital bulimies, which have made enormous unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb even higher.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the country's role as a predecessor as could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues such as Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full Beauty
Everything you can desire, in matters of beauty and well-being, within your reach.
This is the objective that has been set for El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in Callao shopping centre (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of over 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious teachings such as Hedonai, laser hair specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatments rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a diet radius, with in particular a tea salon, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a cup of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of customers, offering them fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly carry out our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after having made our body work, we want to go through the hairdressing room, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the slogans of this urban spa, which will be opened every day of the year from 10am to 22pm.
Miscellaneous decorations
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated take-off. This is not highly recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with electric car
The Endesa electric company, in collaboration with the City Council of Barcelona, created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric car in the city and will establish mobility agreements, taking steps, coordinating, providing grants, etc.
It will also develop the MOVEL project, promote the electric car, collect the views and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, within the framework of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa is involved in the promotion of electric cars.
The company takes part in standardisation groups at European level and a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE are under way.
Zapatero interviews "a future of tranquility" for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, has "a future of peace" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
At the presentation of the President's Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the Executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Motor Sector Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a abandonment landscape, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the government.
"Through this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integral Plan for the Automobile Sector (IPA), devoted EUR 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than €3 billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero has also focused on government demand support measures, alluding to Plan 2000E, which have been put in place in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Exhibition of collection cars, a meeting space for professionals and motor enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pavilón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
We can not only find motorcycles and collection cars, but we will also find items in ClassicAuto Madrid that are all sorts of related to the engine world.
Thus, in the pavilion exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will bring happiness to collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Santas de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Classics, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Exterior aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this trade show will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and contests.
Fitness tests with cars and collection motorcycles will also take place on a circuit arranged outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sport spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated the engine's stopping and start system, called i-Stop, which, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150-horse petrol 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained as a whole.
Details, vehicle finishing, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
By continuing with the whole formed by the control table and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, that of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Gulf of Volkswagen, that they all want to overcome.
By continuing with the habitat, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this a large chest to regular forms.
The engine's automatic shutdown and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-litre petrol engine and 150 horses and with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a true happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its benefits and the control of its consumption.
Although the most requested Mazda3 are the diesel models, those that do not make a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Among the series equipment, the track change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed regulator, photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment was not sufficient, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional €1,500, includes among other elements of the bi-xenon adaptable lights and a BOSE audio system with disc loader.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
In particular, it illustrates the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make a lot of kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version only associated with the 2.0 petrol engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this important amount, Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "first"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality incarnate by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.

Our "P", as sophisticated as habitual, had opted for a "lady" dark.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at his e-mail, without offering the possibility would only be to see certain types of attachments or to browse the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
Actually, it's more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, or less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone's date subscription.
In view of its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American great-brother, but he has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those travelling with a Smartphone already know what it is like to give up the data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a café on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to see their mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it has been a long time since it should work.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the little characters.
The European Commission's repeated reminders to propose affordable roaming rates throughout Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside her country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we're not wrong.
That a small device such as FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers these types of rates, means that operators start thinking differently and study various proposals that allow them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, including the download of books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no gallery.
This is a connected device and is paid when you purchase it and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life like Peek already offers it to the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just wish that because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the preferred color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to the position of Barack Obama to the U.S. presidency with a dress and a coat of this color, she indeed chose the same to accompany her in the second moment, no doubt the most important of her life: the surrender to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pointing towards the green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So, at first glance, it would seem that the first lady in the United States followed the path of the Princess of Asturias and chose to return the same outfits.
But the fabric in which both sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace for taking the function, it would, on the other hand, carry a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium heel green shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden model, this time.
She also changed the hair: the hair is now raised while she was wearing them off the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Fecundity and career of women in Spain" carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey, conducted out of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers had a limited career because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences between the start of life in couples and the number of children, whether or not women work and the type of employment.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have a unstable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are reversing entry into marriage and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of fixed employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after having settled in a couple. This figure goes to 4.1 for those working in the public sector. "This data shows that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to push back the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exerted has a significant influence on maternity, but less on the date of common begin-of-life," says CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that widens the age gap of women's marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those who did elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and at 32.1 years on average, respectively.
"Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have completed elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done middle- and higher-level studies reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of Ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
As of next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several products of the brand, playing the universal currency "Because I value it well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, comes to join other celebrities inscribed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
UK fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and mannequins, of yesterday and today, met for the annual award, which was held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed the meeting.
The former mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Mannequin of the Year.
The Ace Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does so not according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summaries, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent does not spare the friars or the lights.
Delightful, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you a few moments here.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, that which I felt without naming it: pleasure against the funist destiny, moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nishilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in blood, not in the head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, devoid of sense, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven through the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre summits of the universal literature, which must be engraved on the north side, on which the best mountaineers are still and always taken."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
From himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the cry from a bridge by this Munch character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he did it in the flight of himself and invoking the post-territory with a violent speech to the asticites."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she fell on her knees and prayed: "God beloved, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave the worms of Spenser were engraved: "The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the life, tired the death raven."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told her that Edward VII was lying between the Azalées or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man as patient and in love with a nevrose whose literary talent exceeded madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it wasn't to try to conceal Joyce from Baroja?
What is Benet trying to get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did this do if it was not to aspire to the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestal?"
A cowardly attack
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a blood-melle, saved from the SPA and weighed no more than six kilos, and without a word, they struck her two feet that left the dog badly injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what there is to amuse to assault a little defenceless animal for free who was also on leave.
It should be added to this the indignation of a woman who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energy which attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., one Tuesday as another, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint at the headquarters of the neighbourhood even if we doubt that this is a good thing and not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Indignity has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what happens to young people so they find fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, together for the port of helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet, mainly among the younger motorcycle riders, as both structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet port, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in case of two-wheeled accidents.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it contributed to this objective by other educational and informative actions.
This new two-wheel helmet-port incentive campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the widest circulation.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the light market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, most importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of the manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be distorted, since the reference to the comparison was particularly bad in November 2008, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound of last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous fiscal year.
Since January, all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (from passenger cars, pick-up, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
Although the large clouds most affected by their demand have not disappeared, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100 per cent of cases thanks to external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of bank appropriations, other factors such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic environment must be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, the 2000E purchase aid was of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, they may also benefit, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, it was recalled the need for administration to attach particular attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The concessionaires' association provides for a year similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (travel vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this has taken place with the ABS braking system and as this will take place with ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory component on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of shortage has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many back shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing pressure on the brakes in case of emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch car manufacturer, one third of drivers involved in an accident could not support the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all of its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of the so-called emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four disasters with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to radar or camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors rejected the Opel plan until January
While workers at the factory Opel de Figueuelas (Saragossa) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warned that it would need more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, understands that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken within the next few days.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM agrees to be in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer's candidacy of Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, takes importance.
In case there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a portion of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Flying Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, the Porsche engineers left Boxster S and succeeded in grasping it with nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to move, first of all, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual flat roof, allowing them to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winnings, to mount sports bacquets, still 12 kilos, and with light tyres of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they renounced the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six more kilograms and replacing the door handles with cloth handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual clutch PDK box, the test was performed on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads of the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with lead.
On the contrary: it was a long time since we had not tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees so much security in the turns, including at high speed.
He's a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles at small speed for as long as necessary, until we ask him to sprinter, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Wired motor sound
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" option or through a system that modifies engine rusting, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether it be stopped or at recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The road cover we ran with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car managed well the chicken nests.
Electronic assistants barely made a presence on the whole trip, while on some turns we found glazing in the morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Finally, an ultra-light car, more entertaining to drive and that is much more than a simple modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
“ Bag Girl ”
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer displays her face as bad a girl with as much containment as her Chanel bags.
More than a Bad Girl or an It Girl is a Bag Girl.
Baskonia has a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a triumph at 91-82 during his visit to Maccabi Electra's hard terrain, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. He was thus at the head of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which, with eight baskets at three points, was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team has been able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large amount of commitment and collective work, even though it has to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets at three points marked, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blue and red, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Victoria team were marked from the perimeter, it was suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli field with their hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main craftsmen of the 18-20 final of the first quarter-time.
The second quarter-time was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose the interior game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by acclamations and applauses back to their former home, to increase their benefit at pause (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to be noticed as the best player of his team, with 13 points marked, although the "less six" of Splitter's evaluation had already suggested that this night was not going to be the best of Brazilians.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at pause, nothing was played, far from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's that we don't win so easily on the ground, and thanks to "Elias' hand," they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in making yellows take advantage of light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, injured but far from being killed, needed to chain a few skilful actions to take the air, and it was at that time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared that, with three consecutive three-point carts and the help of English and Ribas sent the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises were able to increase at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play everything for the last time and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they were not going to let anyone take what they deserved during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the last minute (80-85), the part was already played and the victory was escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from waging battle
Unicaja suddenly lost to Olympiacos in Greece and gave him the head of Euroliga's Group B in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful and large-scale Europe.
The first-quarter-time game allowed the Andalusian to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive three-point baskets, two of Omar Cook's and one of Guillem Rubio's who set up the local 12-18 team in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the interior game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between the North American drivers Beverley and Williams led the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team started to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal mistakes weighed on the Unicaja.
The interior players and the Lithuanian wingman Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, grew the 44-32 advantage, in the nineteenth minute.
A climb impossible
The third period was particularly offensive to Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, grew superior and even equaled the difference in the fight in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, making the group's head chance.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, to the baskets at three points of Cook, and to Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was practically impossible because Olympiacos proved implacable when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to go back to the score at 81-62, thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja is submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid from your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the wage they would earn based on their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates the wages of users from more than 140,000 job offers available in Trovit, Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since a week of application operation, the search engine has generally detected that the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a communiqué Trovit product manager, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, while a Spanish one receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well paid job in Spain is that of a server, with 11,592 euros net annually, followed by the seller, with 14,725 euros, and the worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs over the last three months are drivers, middle-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overturned President will be required to resign the diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010 at the latest, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed on TV Globo that "Mel" knows he has to leave the embassy, where he has been refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, after his term of office, he must seek another destination."
The chain also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as quickly as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that it intended to impose on it the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, during which inflation of assets has constituted the dominant note on the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by nature uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to currency debt through direct acquisition of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at near zero rates so that financial institutions would purchase assets to be mobilized.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically finalised and, without challenging their non-conformist liquidity policy, begin to put some sand into the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their award to one year of next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the disparity of the company's obligations is increasing again, although they remain very far from the levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Once again, there is a shift towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in the differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this instability episode, but then Standard & Poor's threat of a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk defenders, who were again trying to cause a case of conscience to those responsible for world economic policy that had curbed the destructive effects of the limitation of credit on job destruction, while what should be done is a new day of thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is like a tribal struggle between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot to the roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
On the other hand, it makes sense that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek Government to be transparent and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gap increases to the extent of European business obligations, we do not have to worry.
If the European gap was decreasing and ours continued to increase, then this would be a Spanish idionic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdotal. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise their forecasts upwards for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who come back to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not give much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "safety is mother of certainty".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Members, where the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is discussed on these days.
After his intervention, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the Subcommission, at eight o'clock.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million until 2020 and EUR 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that nuclear power plants in operation today remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 on, the question changes, and power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses both on gas and coal plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, he considers that 18,000 MW are needed more, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the Government's newly approved draft Sustainable Economy Act is in line with what his company claims, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate warming policies.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "time-consumer" measures, as the President of Iberdrola has described them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should start to be made, because they take some time before reaching their maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the leading role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaborative protocol to create the Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct energy efficiency research on highways and airports.
Actiona argues its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, on which it is already working as a power company and water manager.
The construction site is an estimated tunnel of $1,700 million (about €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Aciona to settle in the country as a public works undertaking and grantor of motorways.
The city mayor wishes to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to $1,700 million Australian (about €1,047 million) and in the final phase, three consortia are faced with a remarkable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish-born company, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground work.
Against the Actiona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French manufacturer Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, the capital of which is shared between the Austrian Leighton (filial of the German builder Hochtief, who in turn has the participation of CSA), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatizations, but entering it is a major challenge if it is not the way to acquire a local construction company.
A strategy followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, mentioned above, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalided step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has barely won a seat on this market because of its 30% participation in Hochtief, Leighton's owner.
Assets millionaires
Action has focused on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its energy-supplying activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind turbine park, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the pooling of companies to erect and manage the Adelaide desaliner, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the markets for construction and infrastructure management.
The underground tollway, promoted by the Infrastructure Bureau of the city of Brisbane and the so-called Northern Link, is called to connect the western highway of Toowong to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule established by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll route will be open at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will comprise two channels, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will bring 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to have much success in producing Hochtief, which mentioned yesterday that a contract with the government was valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed fibre-optic network.
This intervention will enable 400,000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company sold the construction project of the King George Tower, 27 floors, in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been given responsibility for the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the construction site is scheduled for early 2010 and will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore was awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to Mrs Rushmore, for a budget of approximately €3 million per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that have submitted to the call for tender organized by Renfe, including four finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to slow down competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for its anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programs on the margins of regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still a state enterprise, accumulates more than EUR 450 million in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it poses to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivistic.
A store for applications
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephony subsidiary followed the signs of other operators and opened a web app shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
At first, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has contributed 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth positions of the clubs that have trapped the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of major clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated EUR 5 362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish teams) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to reach the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams who also billed the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with respect to the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
From this amount, UEFA will devote 413,1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (including the Madrid Atletique) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who were successful received 3.8 million just to be there, plus 550 00 euros for each game.
There is also a win bonus (€800,000) and equality (€400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighths of the finals get three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter of the finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For example, as a fixed payment, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and not more than 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça seized 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments to which 337.8 million are spent.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each TV market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractive places.
The champion of the previous year accounted for 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid on the basis of the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29,9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9 per cent of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force it to launch a public acquisition offer (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which will be paid in 10 years and which will be paid at 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended at EUR 1.85; New Rumasa's offer therefore assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company has claimed that it has contacted the regulator.
If it did, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues the restructuring of his leadership.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible offers of purchase and of judicial services from its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as an internal audit director.
A decision that makes the first woman to occupy a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the supposed diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the next few months His will reveal new diversions of funds cannot be removed.
Regarding credit to Salazar, former Councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
NCMV authorizes the PAA of exclusion of Paternina submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the existing standards and that it considered the contents of the explanatory sheet submitted as a "sufficient" as a result of the changes applied on December 2.
The CNMV stated that the offer relates to the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95 % of social capital, consisting of 6 142,786 shares admitted to negotiation on the Madrid and Bilbao fellowships.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilised, and that they could not in any way be transmitted prior to the completion of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of the parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
To calculate by hand the cost of a repair of between 20 000 and 30,000 euros, including the parts and the hand may take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100 percent of experts use these types of systems.
Service providers and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, then to process them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car gets out on the market, these companies start to work.
This is very hard work, as each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and the price entered.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphical image of each model can be clicked on the different parts of a tourist car.
If it is a model sold massively, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
In the case of a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audadex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audadex has eight centres worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each is specialized in certain brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audadex invests 90 million per year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to provide different uses and offer different products.
The most common application relates to repair and maintenance, but depending on countries, there are also tools for the management of broken parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex does not propose it in our country, but does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audadex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the lighthouse product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audadex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow for the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it is removed from the assembly chain, only through its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows to fill in vehicles declared to be wrecked.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geo-demographic analyses, or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible, for example, to study how many models of a particular brand went to the garage for a failure or how many suffered severe losses for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of disasters, crashes or vehicle maintenance.
The evaluation GT guide is an historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased by 20% per year over the past three years, and it has reached a turnover of 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audadex, on the other hand, was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is realized in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Reportax ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3 per cent more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive €19.1 million, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed in the $1,000 million stock exchange, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been at the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auctions of car accidents
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and killed special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimating and selling service is exclusively for industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cassettes and professional sellers to be registered before starting operations.
This platform was set up in 1996 in Germany and operates more than 650 000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500 000 in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4,000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Four-step garage quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audadex ensures that the user gets a quote in only four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are needed.
Once the model has to be repaired identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary piece is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour prices, increases or reductions, then he can print the currency to deliver it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be credited.
Currently, Audadex works to make these images three dimensions.
This is an innovation that the mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
