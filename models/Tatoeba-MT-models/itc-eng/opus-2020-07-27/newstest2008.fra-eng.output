Inflation in Europe has broken down on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than the forecast, following an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, the European Community Statistical Office located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts only indicated 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the direct interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, with the growth of commodity prices and lower unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "inflation must be deterred" in order to no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 per cent is a record over the last 12 years and in Spain, it is increased from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
The market share of cereals has increased by 88 percent and soya prices have also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose by 52 per cent and, last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will fall from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009, it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, the next 3-4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the Governing rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (The Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly in early December. Thus, since 2002, he has currently had the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Study Institute) has never previously found such low socialist support, 13 percent.
For the faithful electors, the difference would represent, due to the greatest determination of the opposition voters, support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against support of one fifth (20 per cent) for the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent throughout the population.
Of the faithful voters, some to go to vote, the number of supporters of the two parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous low point, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been as high, rose to 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent, the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population is expected to worsen and only one tenth is expected to improve the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of respondents, a majority never seen in Gallup's previous polls, found that the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of polls have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not trust the Prime Minister fully and 27 per cent the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without change of government.
While after the riots last October, 35 per cent of the polls wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of intent to vote, 60 per cent of respondents replied that they would certainly vote and the 20 per cent additional said that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the polls would certainly participate and 15 per cent would probably participate. Following the current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would be clear.
74 per cent of people would say no to enrolment fees in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation costs and 84 per cent would say no to hospital residence fees.
When we look only at the same proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation costs and hospital residence costs respectively.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16% last year, unlike the fact that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article of Napi Gazdaság (Day Economy)
This year, in the Budaörs trade triangle, the usual daily Christmas Cart also increased by 16 percent on average, an increase of significantly higher value than a thousand forints was seen in all hypermarkets.
The prices, "which had already flown away" in the major food stores last December, have not increased sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the items purchased clearly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Shopping Cart in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded at least 91 forints, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value in the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Unicum and live fish prices remained almost at last year's level, but the prices of turkey net, walnut and peacock have increased sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data from the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found from one kilo at 139 forints only.
Competition has not lowered the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising, too in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle marked with two liters of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it was only 257 forints the bottle included.
It does not prevent that this year, in terms of Daily Shopping, Auchan was the cheapest and the cheapest Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the daily price of her Cart by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive basket and the cheapest basket this year, we find a difference of 12 percent while the difference between last year's lowest and most expensive one is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1 206 forints, knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate had already been noticed in the Christmas prices last year.
This process caused trade to be perplexed, hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin to apply on products so that they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a merchant miscalculates the rotation of a product, it may lose a large profit on the margin appropriate to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was higher than 1,720 forged than the value of 2006 whereas the difference between the cheaper baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the most expensive basket value was greater than 1,630 forged than last year's and the prices at least increased by 1,284 also forged.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer goods have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some essential foods, the Institute of Statistics found an increase in prices by more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and egg.)
According to his daily bakery, this seems almost absurd, since the price level of this product, already expensive last year, has just increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers hold a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in making the price increases brutally accepted by multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they keep recording good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the long-conservation food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important tails formed at the caisses of the three hypermarkets, as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain with survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals make the economy on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overuse of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also make the economy on disinfectants
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the trauma service of the János hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred at the same location.
The injured car accident came out of the hospital but shortly after he had to return there because of an MRSA infection and since then doctors have not been able to perform a major operation because of the bacteria found in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
It is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by methicillin-oxacilline-resistant gold staphylococcus.
One third of the people are carriers of the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
SA infections (such as anginas, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) are very responsive to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is highly resistant to antibiotics that will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged failure of the immune system, this bacterium may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on the elderly, of small weight or with a weakened organism.
According to the hospital's managing physician János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital's daily routine.
You don't have to confuse the infection with the epidemic, you don't find MRSA just the one or you don't look for them, Tibor Nyulasi said.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the caregivers put gloves in rubber and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable to treat them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
While the vast majority of MRSA infections may be prevented, current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, Karolina Böröcz says.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It is important to know that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these reviews.
Most cases only see the day if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief doctor of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the healing of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
The realization of microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals make the economy on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferates from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash hands, to put gloves and protective masks. However important gaps are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSA proliferates by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of an epidemic, the patients should be kept away from each other by a minimum of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, save the disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many sick people, so the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina Böröcz said.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in demonstrably or then the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenditures for social security funds, which is why we fight this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, who was responsible for a fatal accident, was not in a position to drink.
The official statement on the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has resigned from his position since, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death on Tuesday, would have led to drunkenness or dizziness, communicated Friday, Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Public Ministry of the Capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before flying
Last Tuesday, the former commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who stood before him when he turned, with his personal car, on the 22nd arrondissement Kossuth Lajos Street. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian passage.
(Moreover, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian passage is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Code of the Road a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and asked for his retirement because, according to the police, he was greatly disturbed by this accident.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Budapest Investigations Department.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner had cooperated with the magistrates in charge of conducting the investigation at the beginning.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements of a total value of EUR 400 million in Budapest on a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget for the transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties with a credit contract of EUR 100 million, and this time the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The appropriation agreement of EUR 150 million also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, while the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties signed a €50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope first as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the draft metro line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would recover from the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary has completed the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its appropriations at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment commission.
Bulgaria, paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans not mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys on this EU market which is always the least expensive but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albéna, the "Golden Seas", the "Cot of the Sun", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly searching for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also wake up the interest of investors and they are also increasing to buy in the cheap corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, and trade and office surfaces promise the highest amortization rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The most vigilant investors already buy large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria at the same time seek to change their life, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or from old delegated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renewed.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general to the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since December last, Bulgaria is cited among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in hopes of achieving a medium- or long-term plus-value.
The price of capital buildings is rising steadily as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last five years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, the meetings of professionals will be completed on Tuesday, but on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the Ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to identify efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol up to 2012.
At this point, lively discussions are taking place between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, they did not wish to discuss accurate figures, but they were prepared to sign an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, without reducing emissions, to provide financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund established by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member Board of Directors probably within the framework of the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its admiral ship role in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 20 per cent compared to the 1990 level, irrespective of the success of the signing of the 2012 Agreement, and was prepared to reduce them by 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997 the Kyoto Protocol's signatory countries had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time had made the commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent over the period between 1985 and 1987, and will fulfil its commitment, recalls the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The issue is high in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement must be put in place within the two-year period, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be rejected after 2012. In this case, commitments to reduce below the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, to deal with climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
The British army units report on the video-sharing site records made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with a view to becoming popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) who was passionate about YouTube: the special units involved in Afghanistan are loading video sequences on operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to London, or the compatriots load them on the Internet.
The political message is indisputable
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net by this way and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and released videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial purpose of the air force, the videos were passed on net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make known to the general public the real objectives of the military's presence abroad.
The propaganda published on this route costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertising on television, to be communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant. However, it also inevitably carries a political message as it justifies in a special form the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is excited because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have been passed on the shared site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
Many videos had already been broadcast on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army had only recently been packed for loading these videos.
The Americans are recruiting a little differently by using the America's Army shooting game that can be downloaded for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in the position of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas Tombola and Beignets in the Ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking beets and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a live music party, another will delight the public servants with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Celebration, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so much fun power.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas celebration will be organized by the Ministry of Defence but it is not the employees of the ministry who will be invited to it.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts for the missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year environment.
Compared with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are going to feast.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320.000 forints and, out of the six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this feast, the Christmas atmosphere will be harsh, there will be actors and also a tombola.
NFÜ's Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice building (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas celebration which is organised with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, a company that manages tenders.
The Gaîté Theatre building has been rented for this purpose.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the person responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only welcomed the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas feast, organized a dance on the occasion of St. Luke on December 7.
The ILO has not paid them the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the [origo] question: the evening was not at all mandatory at this ball.
Departments of Health, Work and Local Communities are preparing a party on the subject.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, does not formally invite his employees to a Christmas party but to an end-of-year working meeting.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have coffee and to eat beets, provided the press service, the party will not cost as much as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his staff to have a drink in the Department of Local Communities and Territorial Planning classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
It has to spend 2,500 per guest forints including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
No planned holiday atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the hour of the feast taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, Christmas will not take place.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the Department's communication, 1,000 per person forints are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, it will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few welcome words from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate at all for Christmas, they have communicated the respective press services to [origo].
The Ministry of the Environment's press service did not know the price of the official Christmas celebration.
However, over four hundred people were invited to the celebration organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike gather together
The League's trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will, Friday, constitute their strike commission, which will be responsible for coordinating the indeterminate Monday strike.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Fund Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major traffic jams as rail traffic will be stopped almost entirely and employees of BKV (common transport company) will also strike until 13 hours.
The Unions of the League will announce, Friday afternoon, details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike commission will also be formed and will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, starting on Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the Health Fund Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Fund Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next step.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, voting on the Health Fund Act is likely to take place only late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, important plugs are planned in the traffic: the railways will stop the work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the joint transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are likely to be stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will be blocked as well.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for a strike, and the list of civil unions is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian Railway Roads and the Free Railway Union (VDSZZZ) have failed to reach agreement on minimum services, or, near Christmas parties, more and more are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., the Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Professors' Democratic Union have called for a 2 and 2 hours to 8 hours to strike respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country in alternation, the Union of Health and Social Sector Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims made by the League requires that the government withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new retirement calculation method to be set up from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim wants a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would enable the system to pass the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Railway Union (VDSZZ), linked to the League's Unions, the Ministry of Economy and Transport's proposal for secondary rail lines and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarszágért Mozgalom (Movement for Better Hungary) increases, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning," the company notes that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "in the short term, aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the escalation of the already existing ethnic tension between the Georgian and non-Tzigan population in Hungary."
The research institute has added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians."
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened, and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, particularly with regard to confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity."
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 and have been called "national self-defense association".
"The common feature of these meetings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare that they are preparing their members for defence missions ( catastrophes, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, further, by referring to the inability of the police, the army, otherwise of the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was going through the method that, based on the retaliation of the political society and the parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions in a civil way.
The focus on the civil character and association status is therefore only to avoid legal pitfalls in the registration of these associations in court but also to be a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk from neighbouring relationships.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) in August 2007.
The many Roma troubles that have exploded in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Using these events, the UNB decided to serve as a guard saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked strong debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the formation of their own custody as a means of resistance points to an increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the telephone agency's request for information, Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on the change of risk, they will inform public opinion, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holiday days and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days of which the number will decrease next year.
Celebrations are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we are celebrating the new year, the last day of the year ending and the first day of the new year are also rest days, especially so that the awakeners can rest quietly.
In addition, in a year, we have eleven parties marked in red.
March 15 is a national festival, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, as on October 23 that is also the commemorative day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1 is the feast of work and on November 1 and 2, we remember the members of our family and our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, depending on the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in the case or there is only one working day left before or after the festival marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on days of replacement for days before or after holidays.
The law extends to all employers and their employees, employees and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions that operate without interruption and in service, through their vocation, and also for rest days.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year's holidays: from December 24, life ends almost throughout the country because according to the experiences most people do rather overtime or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes in order to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
The next year a lot of holidays fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay at home for four days.
On Saturday, April 25 will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays, as from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six foolish things that can be terribly overwhelming to colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost offend us: these are things that "pretty" the daily life of a place of work.
The question is whether we are used to these problems or we face the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing service," said one colleague.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them he forgot to pass the message (that is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have painful explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a folder, an office tool or a phone and you don't find them anywhere.
Remember that night you put the staple on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost in your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them if they're right to be angry with you for beating their property.
Don't get any envelopes, post-it in your pocket, because it may be smoking that there's no more and you need it right away.
You're the privacy officer of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop the potions that spread.
Who did what, with who?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information about your colleagues' privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you declaring yourself ill without just reason?
When you call the office and you say you're sick on the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel bad or you think you need some rest that day, you think that your work, your urgent business, your missions should be done by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or something can happen that will force you to stay at home, don't forget to warn your boss and colleagues to prevent them from ignoring your absence the next day.
Refrigeration, blackmail, telephone
You're falling into your job, but your colleagues' s sneezing out of it brutally?
Did you become, without wanting to, a witness to a phone discussion that you'd better not listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with coldness, singing, loud discussion (which you carry over their heads), foot beatings, big words or discontent expressed with loud voice.
They may disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing the others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the fixed time, you forget to send a mail or important message, don't accuse anyone for that forgotten!
Don't put it on account of the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has brought inconvenience to others, repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault, repair neglect!
Do you feel too much at home at the office?
Getting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't suit the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing you properly, and if your function requires it by putting on nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet the expectations, you're no longer interesting
We slowly advance into the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm sounding up.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tones from the entire hour, then a female choir comes to join it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcast Zagar's Wings of Love song.
Hungarian music has not wasted us for a long time with a high quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the plug is different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground slowly begin to change the overall image and, despite the new style of the garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and played himself in the Yonderboi group before he embarks on his own path, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz ally, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
The early training in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine won2 cited their first album of 2002 among the 50 largest albums of the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive to the west.
Zagar and his whole became indisputably "threatening" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear that label.
The group reacted the way it should, he made a new and better disc.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new paths for them, although the title wishes to represent continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the former group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are there with the reference to flight but next to the air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, broadcasting from early morning music in the evening, started introducing the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
It's all right, then (?).
hvg.hu asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: Has your music remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music with a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The music itself says alternatives, underground can also be poor and made only to sell them and become so commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude also operates in this spirit irrespective of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially to the west, light music has more old traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young people of a dozen or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, and how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, I'm happy to see that people are increasingly coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or the mutual influence already works, but it is perceived only in the inseparable changes of the moment.
I noticed, though, that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you will not be interested anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has been a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though some sometimes try to find traces in our music.
Rather, we are team players who have confidence in the other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was quite inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palm of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love is the first place.
Many have heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style have you consciously opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube so we could sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it at the end of the album to try to soften the organ of sounds and the most difficult themes addressed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choral.
We had the idea of composing this choral of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus the choir was composed of six members: Sena, Edina Kutzora, Jude Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Judge Nemeth, who was later baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or have the girls changed it a little?
Zs.B.: This song had long existed in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing in this song.
The suite of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang at night the melody that girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me back then, but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disc and at the concert I also thought the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a Judy Jay solo short), they do not have a single role, they sing all together and they do not sing louder than music, so music only accompanies their singing.
They were behind the stage, too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only due to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, just let those wings, the wings of love take us.
I wanted the others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, nothing about the music creation process, we had more difficult pieces during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, little by little, everything was set up as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "dropped" this disc.
At this point, this is Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader lives at risk of billions because of its inferiority complex
A covert fraudster.
Thus his former employee the French giant the Société generale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost almost €5 billion because of it.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he acknowledged in time the US mortgage market crisis.
"He's fragile," they let his superiors hear who denounced him to the police.
However, in keeping with Kerviel's statement reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions have resulted in a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis is beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he says in the deposition.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "subprime" mortgages granted to low-income clients or those who had experienced reimbursement difficulties in the past would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to €1.6 billion.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides and adds that he has, of course, not kept anything for himself."
In the entire interrogation, he confesses that he failed the reports so as not to be dismissed.
He managed to double his superiors, although the Eureka stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything
Was he afraid to be discovered?
No, I'm not.
"I thought the simple fact that I got 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he come from to risk so much?
He only gradually reached his position.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after he finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader and in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my career and personal course," Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
As a result of the Allianz actions, he won half a billion euros by putting on the decline in this title during the London bombings.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, you're left in peace.
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
Now that's when the start of the year comes.
It loses one billion euros in one day.
On mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to conceal the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
Chechnya on the occasion to earn 365 billion
Yesterday, the Ministers of the Czech Government signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that Czechia can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be for the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain in the context of these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a total of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme for SMEs and entrepreneurs must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new management methods that are more efficient.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the least successful beneficiaries of the EU funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released and was resident in his farm near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, based on 1997-2002, will be re-incarcerated for the time being, according to the AP agency, not clear.
According to the President of the Ileana Pérez Court of Appeal, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will let Germany finish its sentence at home, or I will be in prison again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Germany regularly moved government money to foreign companies accounts in Panama.
These were fictional companies and the accounts actually belonged to the members of his family and to his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that Germany had created to fund its election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted
That's right.
The State budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority government without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year spent a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was the Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the heated debate before the vote on the statement of defiance to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has adopted without any problem this law, which, although most influential, is usually neglected.
Here's some sort of paradox.
Whether it is desired or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, although hidden behind the competition of opposing government and opposition power.
The latter is more attractive in the media, and that's why he's given more attention in the media.
The arguments of politicians are of much greater interest to the opinion than to the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three ills that the current budget is not able to settle at the same time:
The first being the important part allocated to the expenses of mandates imposed by the law, constituted not only by pensions, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" comprising ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second being a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit in the state budget that represents the greatest alleviation.
The latter is public and relatively under control.
The real bomb to delay is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued, in the background, obligations, disproportionately indebted their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, tax rights and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they were able to repay these debts through the mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, particularly those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatization.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If it is only official and verifiable, it is found that:
Our economy has already been going through for years, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD is still getting over it.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the State.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that mainly reflects the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programs that have, in the past few years, unfortunately inflated unnecessarily.
Although some of the absurd populist spending has been eliminated, approved last year before the elections, if a gap in the retirement age limit, and a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever will be in power, it will only be administered.
By simply exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism, which means that ordinary costs are disbursed by mandate costs.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not spent as much money as they could.
If we really do not want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and grant this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can spend only the equivalent of what it is able to collect in tax and tax rights, the necessary calm for the preparation of new reform laws.
There are only those who will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than a hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
As an example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to the auctions and, in addition, will provide 24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks on 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action at this concerted point, to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report to the customers of the Outlook Group Economic Council.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the probability of a US recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent," adds Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unrefunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts still expect other losses by billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still be pursued," said the Chief Economist of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
The Central Banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The Central Banks made this choice after failure to bring down the interbank rate of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks still feared mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and English Central Banks have declined their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Bank approach will not help to resolve the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
President Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to harm especially developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
This time, criticism of the United Nations international conference on climate change ended in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, in the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he commits himself to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
Now interested persons can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, in his opinion, he had sufficient provisions to write such a book.
He is an academic who is able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are the following thesis: the changing climate, its changes are normal, there is no shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they represent no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
In addition to having the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago, at Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to renew their driving licence in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their former driving licence, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still request renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid permits will enter the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licence especially those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal requests, the authorities in the capital are infested with applications and the number of licence renewal requests has gone increasing this week.
The City Hall is meeting about 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140 OOO drivers have not renewed their driving licences yet.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the release within a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an extra five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to complete the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will be able to drive the road without a valid permit, will be in danger of a fine from January onwards.
The culprit will be forced to pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to former information, it was likely that even a person would not be allowed to travel.
In doing so, it could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's licence is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether or not they want to have it.
It is not like with the identity card which, it, must be valid without exception.
Persons who no longer want to drive should return their driving licences.
It is sufficient to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also required to progressively renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the penalties for detectives with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of collusion with David Berdych's gang, will be 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
The Prague High Court has therefore definitively sentenced them by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the Department of Organized Crime Detectives were at risk of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgement, only a appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently waiting for the verdict of first instance.
However, he has already been sentenced to more than 16 years in prison in other trials.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Court found guilty of holding up 19 people, and today the Supreme Court dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge by claiming that it was a handled case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after agreement among others with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang returned 30 percent of the lark to Opava and Koňařík.
In the indictment there is a question of gang criminal activity in the years 1999-2001.
Essentially armed robbery, which in most cases has suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of the power of a public agent and prohibited armament.
During home searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a laser direct shooter or machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Aside from nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found other charges against Berdych and a whole series of other people.
Other men in the neighborhood of Berdych are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived to the court.
For the time being, the main hearing has avoided Tomáš P ad Maroš Šulej, who are currently being held in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision concerning their extradition in the Czech Republic.
The price of child replacement: 12 million
Lawyer Igor Veleba wants to obtain compensation from the hospital of Třebíč for 12 million crowns plus costs.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, the claim is very high," Dostál said at the release of the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party ordered the drafting.
We'll check if this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál pointed out.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family demanded a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological harm and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better sustained by men, although they were faced with remorse for not being able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, who are less serene in the face of the current trauma and in the face of what is happening right now, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč hospital on December 9th.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at Čermák in Přibyslave and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region gave to each of the families 100,000 crowns for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the error of the Třebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czechia are obliged by law to insurance in civil liability.
In the event of a failure, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
Until now, the courts have recognized relatively little compensation, and the amounts calculated according to the tables were around hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the mark Valašské království (Royaume de Valašsko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, he had used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polivka was not present at today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic about Bolek Polívka's popularity," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valašsko refer to everyone just this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's almost ten years of work behind us.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could benefit from it.
They want to paralyze on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who used the title Valašský král (Roi de Valašsko) for the first time in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had no relation to the project of setting up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of making passports from Valašské Království appear.
An original humorous action led to a lucrative business and business, followed by the creation of Valašské království, by Harabiš.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that its name and signature are listed in the passport and even proposed to the owners of the balances on the price of the visit of its farm and its theatre shows.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only made use of the bare idea, published by Polívka in the Manéž show, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves to the project in an intense manner.
The collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation in Vsetín for Polyvka.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, who culminated with the deposition "of king Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, asking that the court reject today.
What could make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and half the princess.
He's supposed to get a new king out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovakia.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register", added Harabiš.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, driving and also that of manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as being inferior to the average.
At present, however, there is its successor to the Peugeot 207, which, she, is much better.
Especially since the combo named SW is still going a step further, I just need to think better.
When I was testing the classic catchback of Peugeot 207 I was complaining for example about the space for the head on the seats behind me.
As this ends the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will, in this regard, be comfortable.
Let's see how fast it's done.
I'm going to mention the inside very quickly so I won't be over and over again.
This is a design that is almost successful, my only remark on the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a more inventive design, as the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and when you could complain about seats or too short records is revolutionized.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of bodywork is also sensitive there.
The combo also disappears the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A trunk in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle, therefore, is his luggage rack.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting ice) and a rather easy frame.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics which are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold rather heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
According to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, this is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
Separated from Škoda Fabiana Combi, the best-selling vehicle in Czechia.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of Mlada Boleslav product, it is found that Peugeot remains very strongly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to leaving abroad on vacation or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to point out the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the case remaining after the overturning of the files of the rear seats perfectly right, or a very low stepped.
120 horses distributed over four cylinders
The vehicle we tested was equipped with an Otto engine of four cylinders with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what should look like a 1.6 that makes a family hitchback work.
It is silent, it consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda that often gives the impression of having an escape pot bolted by a napkin, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Travel the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not affordable to all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a pretty well equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 liter engine of 329 900 Kč is still visible.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
In addition, we have equipped with head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic glazing, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs 531 900 Kč.
That's a lot, but try to add extra equipment to Fabian's price and you'll get a very similar number.
So there's nothing left but choosing the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is a problem
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern about the evolution of local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin turn into violence.
The case of the North Kent, where there are beginning to be an emphasis on the opposing conflicts that remain and are immigrants of Slovak origin, well illustrates the problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The arguments, the chicana and the fights between the students have been transposed into the relationships between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was hitting a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The guilty woman defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted her by racist remarks.
The police also had to respond to the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenagers.
The young girls allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a young man jumped on the bus stop and started to crack at us.
When I told him to stop, he answered by apples and pears and then discovered his buttocks," he described another unpleasant adventure of a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went to qualify for conflict with immigrants to fight for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to be strained.
70 thousand Slovaks who have come to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
All you expect from your leave can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice or intoxicating cocktails.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but will be enriched.
But there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the deposit and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was built at the beginning of the 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the U.S. Mafia, who had it built, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its clients, there were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the last century's 50's, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and the political men of the entire America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave yourself your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita de la Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed with the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars always travel to Havana, since the jigous and old imported winds have long been in such a salty and wet climate, rotting.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many beautiful colonial monuments as there are there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
As tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green light.
For the past 15 years, new hotels have not only moved to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, as well as on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique to the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the plantations extended in the sugars on a narrow road by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how we can see small locomotives that are not just in museums.
Where are you headed?
Most visitors do not miss the best known places.
So there is no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Instead of recalling that in Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the person who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Viňales in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows on a limestone soil.
Mocks, limestone balloons and rocks climb into a candle from the bottom of the valley, and, from fertile soil caught in their guts, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is where Cuban tobacco is likely to be grown of the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
Someone might also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It was the trade of slaves and that of sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The richness has been incarnate in the beauty and the vitrine character of this small city.
Coloniální španělská architektura, výrazně ovllněná pondějšími francuzskými osadníky, se čtyři staletí teměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the massive Escambray, is a place so far apart that in the last century's 50's, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolition anything either, each one just had a roof over his head.
If you have, in Trinidad, more than one afternoon, then it is worth going to see also interesting places around, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which is excited after sunset and where music is only in the morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads there.
The two roads that drive from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without any mark of human activity.
UNESCO has placed the East Cuban equéil, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
There is the best chocolate, at the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after the periple of Colomb) and from the hill where the old castle is held and the present hotel El Castillo, we see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About the coffee, rum, cigars, the massive Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of the Trues and the Island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the holy patron of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a number of pages.
Only, as we're saying, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment, according to the United States, has an impact on the progress of the mission to Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not expected to take place as it should, agreed with Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing dispute by the Taliban movement, today the eight States involved are also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States has called through the defence minister Robert Gates the NATO troops to greater activity this week, Britain sees the strengthening of Afghan government authority and the intensification of development assistance as a priority.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be a part of the solution.
The other being to allow people to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," said British Defense Minister Des Browne at the BBC.
Eighty-tenths per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to data from the U.S. Army, the most intense of the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent over the past year, up to 60 per cent in the Helmand province, south of the country.
NATO countries have approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the south.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In concrete terms, they require other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
The Secretary-General of NATO Jaap of Hoop today held similar statements.
"I'm not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told the Reuters agency at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that would last three days.
Who is passive
In recent months, conflicts have also existed among the countries involved in the issue if all allies are effectively doing as much as possible in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its liability.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the combat requirements of which they are subject are not as rigorous as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun qualified German soldiers as lazy this week.
"The hungry Afghans discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," wrote Sun in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on a counter-attack by posting a photo of a British troop during a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to one billion in 2009
The burden of a government debt exceeding 84,000 crowns lies with each Czech.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
As a result of a change in government budget savings, the department has reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic is increased by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
Thus, during the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, however, it has fallen by 13.4 billion krona.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its government debt data from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns lies with each Czech.
Over the last year, the state lost more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, one can go beyond the border of only one billion crowns in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said the Analyst of Patria Finance David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
Next Finance Analyst Vladimir Pikor's forecast is similar: "The billion could be exceeded by 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the political situation was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed by 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he said.
Debts Increase
The debt of the State is constituted by the central government's debts and is mainly generated by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The State debt is financed by securities from the treasury, annuities, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The State's domestic debt has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's external debt has increased this year from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the State called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion krona and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion krona.
The average exigency of the State's debt was 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased from the first to the third half of 13 percent, which is, given the current health of the economy, too high.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the pension securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be material to negotiate when pension reform comes," commented the Pikora data.
Better than expected
It follows from the Government's 2007 strategy for financing and managing government debt that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a change in savings in the state budget, the department has reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is essentially the deficit in the state budget, which clearly amounts to 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the initially planned 91.3 billion crowns.
Next, these are the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state-of-the-art pensions for 43 billion crowns and the repayments of the European Investment Bank's loans amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
She was comparing today to a court in Khartoum for appointing a teddy bear
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insult to Islam was convicted on Thursday evening by a Khartoum court at 15 days' imprisonment and expulsion, his lawyer said.
The British was accused of having left students between 6 and 7 years old to name a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was subject to a whipping penalty.
This 54-year-old British institute, based on the United High School in Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday and charged with assault on Islam and the holding, pursuant to article 125 of the Sudan Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students from the Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher in the same school in the Sudan, said that he knew her well and would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said, "it's only an innocent mistake."
Opinion shared by many students of the institute who describe it as "very attentive to his students" and "who never speaks of religion in class".
Let us recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second most famous first name in Britain, he writes in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules for the use of this first name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
Of course, this is a question of interpretation.
They did not reach agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, the failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion meeting on the future status of the separatist province on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status," said the European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence in the immediate future, but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, according to the fact that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika ombudsmen, the EU, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated by 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final session of negotiations since the Troika was responsible for further mediation by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation to be completed on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, insist on further negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of onusian administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that the EU's independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council did not agree on it.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately no agreement was found," announced Kosovo's president Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden, where these "last chance negotiations had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that Belgrade's self-government plan "belonged to a past that led to killings and deportations".
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, considered that a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said, among other things, to redominate a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the delegation of Serbia had insisted that any decision be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: at the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be "in consultation" with the West.
Bush brings an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the International Peace Conference held in Annapolis on Tuesday, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He explained that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old quarrel between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations under the "roadfire" for peace that they accepted in 2003.
The White House leader stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty that resolves all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This designation covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the President of the United States, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In turn, Olmert committed himself to making future talks "direct and continuous" and to making "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing his "two-State vision" of Palestinian and Israeli co-existence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this direction from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the root of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saud in his interview with Saudi-capital Arab daily.
For the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
Like every time in this different kind of act, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate (IGN), a police car was traveling on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without gyro," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, therefore not allowed to travel on the public road" (read below) and piloted by two young people without helmets, circulated "very bright allure".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a priority right-hand refusal," said a police officer.
The alcohol control of the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (formerly released, star windshield, bumphead) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Therère de Givry, announced that he had committed an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assisted persons in danger" to the IPGN, a cohesy with the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation at this stage was dissociating the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a kind of scratch, probably caused by rubble on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were kept closed as long as the police car was able to stop.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have quickly left the premises, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "any serious mistake" on this point.
"It is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which to be very careful," said a police source.
Libération met with an eyewitness of those few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows giving exactly on the stage.
"We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to heal them," said this witness.
There was nothing to be done."
He then saw "a completely wounded policeman, who was boxing.
Two others were trying to rejuvenate one of the young people, the fourth was on the phone."
In the face of the tension that soon surrounded the scene, and it seems to be certain that the people who were present about the unexpected situation of young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the place.
According to this witness, the relief arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police officers".
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let the police provide assistance to young people.
These young men were dried up.
Firemen arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out.
The tension is rising in Pakistan
The Pakistani police suppressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, to the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by the tear-threatening grenades used by law enforcement forces, according to witnesses.
The latter returned by throwing stones, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were interviewed.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers have charged and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly questioned.
In Islamabad, the Bar Association lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other events would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The movement of lawyers gathered on Monday the support of religious parties grouped into the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president '' exhorted the people to send flowers to the judges who have pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and the waste to those who have sworn before Musharraf'.
''The promise of Musharraf no longer stands''
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly covered by the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
It was due to take action in the coming days on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf on 6 October, on the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
''All that we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court rulings',' said the magistrate in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president 'holds no more' after the state of emergency, said the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani Government has denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been granted residence by his Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unplanned births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not expected, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwireth Act that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception has also allowed a better "fertility control", according to the Institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
See calculated next month for a couple of five and if possible in spring, season deemed to be the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repairs on the space station
It would take more than seven hours of work in space to astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crews at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, indispensable for the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated records due to its duration, its remoteness from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the astronauts' "brake" tools to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday as astronauts unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical room for European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a kind of docking for the modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a solar panel power generation module weighing 17.5 tonnes, already present on the ISS, to place it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began to redeploy solar panels from the module with a size of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds as accordions, was damaged on about a meter by a cable that stuck.
The deployment was stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to carry out a check-out of the Discovery shuttle, then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracle at the end of 30 meters long of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space marketer) of the Nasa.
Large, resistant, very neat, it has a highly developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, the training physician was therefore charged with "acting" the "injured" solar panel.
After inspecting the damage, he hacked the wrong cable and installed kinds of "arms" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-skirt hockey cane wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricoled" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying its tools and returning the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts were taking advantage of half a day's relaxation before today, seven astronauts did not return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in the Stock Exchange
The EADS action is now going down at the Paris stock exchange, after the aircraft and defence group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its expected operational result for 2007 following the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which conditiones the opening flight of the aircraft.
The cost of covering the delay in delivering its military aircraft, announced in October, is 'EUR 1.2 billion to EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus', announced the home of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be required to announce new operating result objectives (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without more quantified details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads related to the delays of another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension, on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a television message on the public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as the leader of the Russian list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be transpired by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of preference during the campaign.
"We know the price of real democracy and wish for honest, transparent and open elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
It denounces a pressure campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziugonov says there were "never such dirty elections, even at the time of Eltsine".
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, the former chess champ Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, remains prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsuspended legislatures there are two questions that are much more open:
- Who's next to Putin for the presidency?
The official newspaper issued yesterday the date of the first presidential round, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
He was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin was unable to issue a third consecutive mandate.
But no successors emerge.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The head of the parliamentary majority and the powerful united Russian party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both the legislature and the president, the power coming out will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mindset of the Soviet homo, they do not feel master of their destiny," says Sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society has slowed down in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine has renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the people all the more that this new paternalism has not been followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "responsibly renounce personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
“What do you think about?”
The phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 heads of Russian regions) running the local lists of Russia united.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
Nor will the Russians vote for extremists on behalf of the Russians.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "What good is thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are free access.
The 47 million archive documents, stored on 27 km of liner in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), have so far been accessible only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e., individually and nominally, upon request of an old victim or his entitleds.
The 11 States in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratifying this agreement by all States has been completed, and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Access by historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research "in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers," said Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, including Germany, had opposed the opening of these nomination documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to provide evidence of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Mr. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Antisemitism at the University of Berlin Technical University in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers had given their green fire to the European Commission in April to enter into negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) to sign free trade agreements with India. Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached almost EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A pact for free exchange of labour enormously between the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, has specified the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange annually for "EUR 47 billion of goods" and for "EUR 10 billion of services", said this week Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation to New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durano Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England called itself Thursday concerned to ease the current return of credit concerns, and announced a ten billion-pound offer at the basic rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusual offer.
"To alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over that period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its provision of reserves scheduled for the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," says a communiqué.
The bank states that £10 billion (14 billion) will be placed on the market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time BoE seems to be placing five weeks' cash on the market in an open market operation.
These usually take place within a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain the rates" of day-to-day interbank loans with its basic rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has been 6.6%, a higher rate since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the Bank of England's amounts on the market have been accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from using them.
According to some rumors, supported by the evolution of the book price compared to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the European Central Bank's market amounts, at more advantageous rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the Socialist Bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text was included in a socialist "nice" (during the initiative of a parliamentary group), and it declined a dozen measures adopted by the national PS office on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the recovery of the floating TIP, a cheque-transport or rent management.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was lifted following the general discussion which resulted in exchanges, sometimes vivid, between a majority and a few hours' opposition to Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
As a result of many rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the UK producer Melvin Benn Republic Festival.
"To our company, it's an honor to work with someone who has, no less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival is expected to be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres to approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989, he took the bar from Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" to which he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style event festival.
"Our planes chose Philadelphia as a market and worked closely with Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic by this project.
Unfortunately, we got involved in politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Herourly, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the population of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after starting in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban settings.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours are taking place in urban green spaces," said Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a rural festival in Europe and in urban America."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, eagerly supports the holding of this event," said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the host capacity of this festival is "very great", like that of 80,000 people from Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been launched to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed when going to the press.
"Vineland will taste rock, but music will vary there, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montréal faces Terminators
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film trays in Montreal when no other Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate's duties.
A mandate - “politically difficult” because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the “runaway productions”.
Is it difficult to play in the governor's legs?
"We must be careful, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she'll be there.
Our role is to offer those they will judge best," he says.
The Festival Race
For now, Denis Turcotte's priority is, however, the promotion of cinema here.
The Oscars race started.
It will be of all festivals in the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Age had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year stock exchange rally? Experts divided by the subprime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands in the hope that the traditional year-end rally will arrive.
However, this year the experts are not as sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in stock market generally has positive behaviour.
However, statistics-based forecasts should not be made, since, given the current context, uncertainties are on the markets, at least on the short term."
Although they are not supporters of the stock exchange during the last few weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is fed by the existence of liquidity, ready to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of leaking to quality values both in long and short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because we are not aware of the impact of the probable decline in Fed rates, given the high gross level and the danger of inflationary tension stimulation"
Javier Barrio, in charge of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"That's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost almost 4% since November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this vision so negative.
Juan Solana, Analyst of Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the festival of the Constitution (6 December).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, Analyst of Investment Bank, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebounding of the index that could be caused by information from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, from Inversos Banco, ensures that the increases will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they move.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological companies will do so very well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
In the last seven years, only two occasions in December have been a month's kisser.
The genuine end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which the stock market emerged from the crisis caused by the growth of the technology bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68 per cent.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the time being Ibex has increased by 8.36 per cent since January) and if it succeeds on the computer on its end-of-year rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices from Monday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in Spain's most commercial areas.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m. and to open on Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the popular bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to adhere to this initiative that coincides with trade schedules.
This is precisely what the Popular Bank is looking for.
Attract the autonomous customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in the SMEs and the street trades chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new agencies but a renewal of existing ones.
For this, the organization will modernise the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the times is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new design, more modern, with more bright colours.
The bank trader, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renewal does not involve large investments, but hiring staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as explained by Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successful, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the Mondocredit brand, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
' We do not want to compete with our customers ', Rivero said.
At the moment, they reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telefive double for the first time the value in Stock Exchange of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a managing consultant from Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he directed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect of his joy was that "what hurts me, it's not the fact that we've increased but that we're less down," he said.
However, he emphasized that on a weak market, 'we have dropped less '.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This win stabilizes its loss to 15.66% in one year.
The value of the company's stock exchange controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, who gave up 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a 40.5% decrease since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed in the Stock Exchange is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Five Days) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Anenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of hearing '.
Telecinco announced last week that he planned to become the first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as Giuseppe Tringali, the managing branch of Telecinco and Publiespaña, said.
For this to be true, the television channel should record an increase of 3.6% in its billing for advertising compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year for the current fiscal year.
For its part, antenna 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in the Stock Exchange is the important pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría has distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is currently giving signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profits estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and 2009 to 7%.
This is due, as explained by the decrease in expected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast of earnings from Antwerp 3 to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and to 7.5 per cent in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MEPs and senators to negotiate and allow better regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the organization's activity to ensure the effective functioning of the markets.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, implies the modernisation of financial markets, at the time it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) and promotes cooperation among the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial consultation services for both specialized social reasons and natural and legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI), which merge securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it increases the number of operating systems on financial instruments so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current stock market managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management, and requires them to keep a record of all the transactions they perform, in order to facilitate the control by the NCMV.
In passing through the Congressional Economy Commission, several amendments have been added, including one showing that the debt held will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which demonstrated itself with what happened with the high-risk U.S. mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the management's transposition to legally delineate the functions that graduates in the Economy may be 30 years after it was approved in 1977, the royal decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the NCMV and who will be able to provide its services for product marketing and attracting new clients to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index rose by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which serves after Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy by providing data comparable in time and in quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information on which it is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be disclosed next December 14.
"The CPI will continue on relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in CPI in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has indicated in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential on monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We expect a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
The Northern Rock deposits have dropped to more than 50% up to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit with the Bank of England.
At that time, he held up some record deposits over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that gradually fell in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the guarantee of 100% of the money that the Government had offered and that it would remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would name the organization with her financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to collect about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain the remaining 18,000 million pounds up to the target of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson magnate group, known for its advertising creative campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of the Virgin Association, to which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from the bankroute.
The Mayor of Totana was arrested for a plot of alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council's secretaries and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the term of May last Juan Morales, current right-wing deputy, and until then municipal councillor of the mayor, who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'manor' of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Council and the possibility of further arrests in the coming hours is not deferred.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this week, was shot.
As indicated yesterday by the SER Chain to the lawyer of the MP 'of the popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving the home of Morales with important documentation in his possession relative to the plot.
Furthermore, according to the sources of the investigation, the purpose of the investigation is the alleged incantation of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to re-qualify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight persons in detention.
Bono agrees to be the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Tolede and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the leader of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toléde for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
Thus, the secretary of organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference following the meeting that took place this afternoon at the headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and "Bono is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that La Manche's political man will be the candidate of the socialist group who will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made his decision on 15 November to not go to the next general elections and to leave his political career to focus on the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political front since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, even though citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the Chamber into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and to make it "more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where we cannot speak quietly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know how to do" and he did not want to act as if he already occupied his position to avoid falling, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might regard as "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subjected to relentless persecution both the skeptics of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach forces him to explain why his Government's action or inaction has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leading European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for non-implementation, in which sectors it has occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will have to do, what economic consequences this will cause.
That is to say, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was no and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, actual measures, are unpopular.
Cost-effective, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individuals' accounts.
Until the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so mentally dangerous in Zapatero that he rushed to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have an impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for the electoral campaigns that he does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not require, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and that it does not claim that we move in bicycles or refresh ourselves with the fan.
The mayor and chief of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the mayor's secretary and a suspicious hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where at the moment many officials met, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Councillor of Urbanism and the Municipal Management Company of Sol Industriel and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation concerning the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Totana Tribunal No. 1 instructs.
The first six detainees were brought to justice today.
According to sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentary party of PP, Juan Morales, is covered by the investigation.
In addition, the former woman, who owns a registered real estate agency currently in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancee of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcie.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wine-pots would have been realized.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Opérative Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcie, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
As a result, only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a very well-known poultry company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 accommodation, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana that had been re-qualified and its project would assume to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are responsible for the promotion of real estate; Conycase, which manages the parks of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the place of Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gave us the comment of yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (some in the head of information PISA above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course brought public opinion into focus as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written on the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and stated that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools."

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet Downloads:
A. The downloading of a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered to be only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. The theft in a store for up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than the one imposed for the download (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and make it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the one imposed for the download (a section 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact disks.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and trafficking of CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on foreign research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less '.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted thanks to Tomographic Magnetic Resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for the neurocognition images of the Institute Life & Bran, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his companion failed".
The researchers observed that when both individuals found that they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion requires so much science.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will be angry with a bitter taste, because the chief leaders of Srebrenica's murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead - the former general Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still free.
Their names are on this list, whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'the Carla' list (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who continues the criminals to flee and pressure the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance do I need?
Motor insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible losses, implies an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of driving licences, marital status, the type of vehicle to be ensured or the actual use, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it's that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is based on an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be ensured or used, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the more likely they are to suffer an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
This is why people over 25 years of age and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of disaster than in their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that the insurance, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, provides a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various disadvantages when placing an insurance contract at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and the old driving licence.
Although the ideal to be assured is a risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most anticipated drivers can opt for any risk insurance with freeness, so that they get coverage from an insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the client pays part of the disaster amount.
"The part of the loss will be determined by the customer according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head of First Europe, online insurance mediator in Spain.
Another option is the extended third party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but for those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you're a 25-year-old, you're trying to be careful and avoid the damage to the extent possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The subsidies and sanctions will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to increase the bonuses," Noguera clarifies.
Beyond the age of 25, this becomes easier for drivers at the time of an insurance contract, as the disaster rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
That is why it is preferable to choose insurance without charge.
"Youths can't normally take advantage of the experience previously acquired after an accident", the director of the European company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at any risk, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers as persons with the lowest rate of disaster, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk-free insurance (which could be EUR 300), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more informal drive and they have greater purchasing power to afford themselves the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchises," Justice Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, a risk-free insurance is preferable (if EUR 150) or an extended third-party insurance where the insurer has a high level of subsidy.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver with possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that is most appropriate for us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to get to the eighth finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are measured next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as it serves Italians to be first and Scottish to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified for the fifth day thanks to a null match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to ensure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass it to him.
These two Group D games will take place one week before the sixth day is over, as Milan AC will have to fight the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on 13 of this month in search of a place for the end of 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the null match at the Giuseppe Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at their homes and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it will remain first and will ensure a better cross in the eighth finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be sufficient to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not be able to computer only on this since with nine points the game returns to Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have good hope of qualifying for the eighth finals for the second time to the Champions League, after having been beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in the event that Celtic would lose, to rank for the eighth finals in order to continue the league of UEFA champions.
And it is that, although Benfica is last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, it could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls Tour concert in Vancouver
Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group broke down in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stage in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "bright".
About 20,000 people ran out of tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video that recounted the story of the group that was furious at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincides with the launch of a new album, which is a major success, as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voooo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of Spice Girls came up on stage showing the bracelets offered by the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Prior to the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show."
' Sporty Spice ' which is part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw people's feelings changed, the feeling for Spice Girls changed.
And I thought about why not, I'm glad I made a decision," said Chisholm on the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that with time, " things have been arranged and we appreciate it very much."
But a lot has changed since Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
To start with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special flight from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
They count to her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be held in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will be held in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is alarming.
A heated dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, thereby increasing the risk of fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are driven by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurred after the Ukrainian and Gazprom government, a Russian-owned gas monopoly company, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as planned, its prices in Ukraine as it has agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gases from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts stated that this would involve, for Ukraine, a 40% increase in the cost of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," said the Ukrainian Minister of the Economy, Anatoly Kinkh, to Reuters news agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to the fall in exports to Western Europe, resulting in higher prices.
Russian gas represents one-quarter of EU supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the controls to be carried out on its outside community employees to check if they have previous penalties, said the Control Committee.
The warning of the Rev.G., Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no specific data on the number of overseas people it employs.
Its report also highlighted other decisive controls, correctly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The reviewer-general carried out checks on outside Community staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, a doctor of Iraqi origin in the service of the Royal Alexandra Hospital of Paisley, was arrested at the airport after being buried with his jeep, at the doors of the main terminal.
He was a member of the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, as he was suspected of being involved in various attempts to blow up cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment controls on overseas staff, to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Division to carry out previous criminal controls, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the many warnings, the general reviewer's report now states that committees are required to deal with the Office of Control of precedent penalties, allowing employers to undertake controls on different countries.
"Although we have found out that some information about the staff has been well verified, this is not done at all." the report announces.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment controls it would do itself, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain members of the overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland said it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls can identify employees who may commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that pre-employment checks currently carried out, work well in the Scottish health system, and it is not certain that these warnings can provide any added value."
The Scottish health authorities stated that they employ 1161 overseas people, who are made up of most doctors and nurses.
However, the general reviewer pointed out that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems with the identification of staff with indeterminate contracts, which could choose to remain in our country or not.
The investigation showed that the current procedures of health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite appropriate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment controls for staff outside the ocean of the health service.
Secretary to Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish Government allied to the health committees would take careful note of the warnings contained in the report to be issued next month, and would undertake to ensure better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, which are valid for all employees, including overseas people.

Ray Winston, renowned for his coriander character interpretations, won the Richard Harris Award for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, having filmed films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the suite of Indiana Jones, The Crystal Crannel Kingdom.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honour of star Harris, a protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to the cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admiring to this great current actor, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "the Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of stage makers, actors and festival organizers.

Saudi Arabia Block 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells operating an imminent attack on a oil site, as well as attacks on the clergy and the armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters launched a campaign against the United States Allied monarchy since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell composed of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on a oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 troops to protect sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper cites a statement by the Minister of the Interior, stated that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who has infiltrated the country.
It is said that militants were planning against eight-missile bands in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appear to have conspired on the murder of clergy and armed forces.
The government asked the clergy to do more against the Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and against the Shiite government allied to the United States, considered as heretics according to the harsh line of the Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergy have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
Activists, encouraged by appeals against the Saudi Government in the West, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces over the last five... months," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on State television.
Among the detainees, 16 Medina members are organized into a "media cell" to promote "Takfiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against unfaithful and aposted Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing the militants.
Venus's climate could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
The data from the European vessel in orbit showed that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the world's closest to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and might even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation linked to a slower rotation has led Venus to a different kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency probe, which studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor of the Physics Department of Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand why Venus' climate is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data enables us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, even with a living area."
Uranium enriched by the police.
One kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Again open to everything
Mitt Romney stated that he was not a candidate for the presidency to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican candidates for the presidency have finally agreed to participate in the debate of You Tube, during which many ordinary voters have registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as the outcome of another debate by You Tube, when a snowman asked Democrats for their position in relation to global warming.
But this time, the questions and the answers have largely reflected the conditions of the Republican party, who is a candidate for the next elections.
We don't know what criteria, CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show the candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard fun things: The board raised approval increases when candidates spoke crudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is in the lead of the important anticipated elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his mandate as mayor in New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of using illegal immigrants in his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when they were asked whether they would be prepared to promote an "amnesity" (provided the illegals with a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to explore this subject.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, it can be because they started to fight immigration before and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, coupled with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears of the outside world, encourages the Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other issues have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water into the nose should be considered torture.
One stakeholder asked whether candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though it is not about believing in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - at the stake in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - to declare that the death penalty is painful as much as necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to stand in the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's ascent to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious quest for subsidies by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during the Wednesday debate.
These two are emerging from the negator, thanks to the fact that the two protected parties fail to agree to decide who is the best known and most traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party in good time and convincingly thanks to a successful message about American greatness thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to shade; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
In view of the trend in British scandals, it is not particularly juridical.
No decorations sold, no bills of Parisian hotel politicians, no extra-marital dress finger.
But here's a revelation that a rich businessman would have hidden for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £600,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle with Gordon Brown would have gone well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister walked backwards in his draft election, insulting the British intelligence stupidly claiming that the opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, instead, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrible Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's purchase, a bank in difficulty on board the crack, demonstrated a failure of directives and poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals for the change of the tax code led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the reduction of military spending: they proclaimed that they are the minister of defence, a part-time job for them.
At present, the suspicion of crazy donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labour (and his former chief of vigilance) made them have had to resign.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is constantly heading toward the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer working; the ministers' offices are making the record; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any goal.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast to be a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was a Chancellor of the British treasury.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's woes, such as the long investigation into the funds of the party "money counting for members of the House of Lords", voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not so tragic that she seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the Tories party members believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to realize Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies always in favour of a government that is reliable and slightly brutal.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compared his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big subsidisers of politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, not knowing that this was illegal, should therefore be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, who was responsible for the collection of grants that had spoken of questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown has not been involved: Nothing suggests that he has been aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made have been made as a result of his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but failed to draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, to use an investigation committee on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it's the police's responsibility.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chair for the Independent Committee of the Standards of Public Life, without a leader for six months, and preparing for a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would require the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead him to renounce his special financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such Mr. Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to regain the voters, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see squirted swimmers, swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators aim at the U.S. credit cards market.
The analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the rates of costs and insolvency, which measures the shares of the non-recoverable balance sheet or are, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly due to the weakness of card carriers.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvabilities are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly due to technical factors.
A change of laws in the United States in 2005 regarding personal banking has caused an abrupt drop in banker archives, which in turn caused heavy credit card losses; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions had to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to settle.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is strong enough despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 would be 25% higher than last year.
The direct linkages between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate borrowings have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species than to the value of heritage, and therefore the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily result in a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for the payment of mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, debt by credit card would become a priority to repair the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and more flexibly to such crisis conditions as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of actions.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and reassess all borrowings." said Gary Perlin, Capital One Director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk of a significant decline.
If the lower prices of real estate and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal swimmers..
The British bankers plead guilty for the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to testify to their roles in relation to a fraud committed by the previous financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared themselves innocent of the seven charges for alleged collusion fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich himself despite their employees.
They are due to be brought to court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of committing a fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Britain because of the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding question for this investigation, which took place following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, known as the "three of Natwest" claimed to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to cheat on banking procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest of the bank of the subsidiary for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 in Kopper as an interest in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The charges indicated that the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracys in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endured six-year imprisonment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released as a result of the payment of $1 million each, making them live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, in banking in December 2001, after years of accountancy, could no longer hide his billion debt or even propose his bid speculations as profitable.
The collapse has caused thousands of layoffs, over $60 billion market value loss and over $2 billion loss for pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were futile because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Not in, not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a stopover from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats since it is more of a family aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday, at the Millionaires Salon, an orgy of incentive for consumption, for four days, which is held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new Russian rich for their varied products, ranging from yachts in acajo to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer searched a bright orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"it's a pretty car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to roll in black gold, such Dallas"
"We had the same experience in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were regarded as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar of the Davis department of Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University."
As the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians emerge as the world's largest expenditures.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a luxury industry conference enabled Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has $53 billion worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are globally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists of the economic and financial research centre.
(the World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow, that is why we are all there," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London jeweller.
She participated in the trade fair for the first time with the Russian distributor, The Bijoutier Group of Soho.
“All women are well prepared, and men have a wealth.”
Walking in the living room, Sunday night, the two real estate agents placed on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 claim to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I was looking at cars and trying to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who seized her high-cut dress such a veteran of the red carpet like Joan Rivers.
The living room seems primarily aimed at the new wealthy, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to tail in the hoods to come up to a huge warehouse where are exposed Cadillac Escalades, cans in platinium, Mövenpick ice, personalized pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund stuffed bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and the best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal factory stand for the manufacture of Dutch Delf porcelain, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles, hand made.
"it is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers here stated that Russians with old capitals (10 to 15 years are too much in line with Russian standards) have already passed out of striking logos to a kind of limited-editing brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires or tourists, are hanging on the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of the King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton embedded with gold wires.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with last cry alarm systems, also claimed to have sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday after noon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car drawn for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals to look like a wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of brass leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in the prices of the real estate here.
"if you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you'd already be millionaire, at least on paper, if it's not in question," he said.
"there's more than you could think of"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has erected four stands representing the British telephone booths, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers stopped to launch masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobiles, in the middle of this false wealth or in the midst of a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Unauthorized suspected homicide surgeon in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was looking through the window bay of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and watching an ambulance that had just stopped at the door of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrives.
and then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, whom the police have not yet identified, resident of West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Miss Arroyo's death, but they are confident, the results of the toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take time, but which should allow to resolve this mysterious death that saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Melle Arroyo was the assistant of the police director Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, a great worker and tenacious," McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"it was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything to protect me."
McCarthy stated that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, leaving two sons aged 14 and 11 as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, speaking from the Union County Public Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Miss Arroyo died of unauthorized surgery.
"It is a possibility to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities said they had arrived at her house around 15 hours ago.
and found Miss creaking on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation nor even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh was unable to confirm whether Melle Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical firm.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro's house, where a giant roses lay in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian poured down the back.
A blue canon called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in kitchen and for perfumes, was lying in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two bicycles all over the sides.
McCarthy stated that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Department of Police, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him navigate into the new city and abandon his framed political culture.
"She said "you must pay attention to this," he said.
"She was there when I came, and again when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the global stock exchange.
The shares were exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would try to calm credit conditions, thereby reducing subsequently the interest rates promoted by the reassuring statements of the vice president of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets affected.
In an obvious effort to reassure the irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partially "inverted certain improvements in the functioning of the market late September and October.
In the event that this turbulence was to persist, it would increase the likelihood of a further rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that further reductions in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news about the US economy, such as the biggest decline in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil has been exacerbated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will fire 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losers of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55% reaching 13.289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German index Dax increased by 2.6% and the French ACC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the re-appearance of market credit difficulties has been highlighted in response to the high demand for a monthly auction of tri-funds from the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject additional funds into the London financial markets causing credit strains led to the fact that the three-monthly borrowing rates "Libor" the British banks have caused their highest growth since September last year, to 6.59% following a high rise since November 12.
England faces a call for judgment against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the n°6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectioners who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moore, coach leader, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President General of England, begins to fill out the application forms to become a national selectionr, at least in part-time.
The one who will not be able to win the n°6 dosard will be bad, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to remove what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than because of lack of skill.
There is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because at the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubeby"; both, new executives having good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricket unless at least one chance is given to it?
Figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket has to catch the captain's eye, at the same time he has to take the door and a beater must be lucky to touch the cricket one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to earn a seat.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 on the same average, but both have already lived their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's gonna play at Asgiriya Stadium, that's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and was successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful rounds, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also fighting to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary cricket of the Test, and that despite the fact that his double cent marked against Australia could still be under estimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning at the 88-year-old innings of the Test in Bombay, 32 cents of first class compared to six for Bopara, who at 22 years of age is younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah only made ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Lord's Test, his city of Middlesex player, and that, immediate rejection by the pickers when Vaughan again in shape, claims his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious movements in Bombay.
Unlike him, the player of Essex is very happy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerates when he recently hit a 4x4 at a Volkswagen presentation, sponsor of England.
He deferred only a few slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his teamman who looked at him from a distance, to ask him if "had he seen this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, its bright glow allows him to do services that go to him, and that he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Can this be the true art of the selection?
I would be able to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, spilling these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hoped that the city had returned to normal.
Some have come back to fight the militants who have distanced them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who came back by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because I saw TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and since the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to leave for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated area of Amariyah, returned with his two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents the Iraqis from working.
His Shia neighbours in Amariyah called him in to inform him that the US-aided militia, let Al Qaeda drive west of the capital, and invited him back home.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of an attack on the grenade after he urged the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm going back today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many say that they have been attracted by the increasing calm of the capital since the American troops arrived, and in view of continuing training of well-armed "groups of citizens" and working with American military to defend their neighbours.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline in the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three children, expressed the suspicion of everyone about the exile visas that Nuri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit their entry into the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country because of the death squadrons.
"We didn't have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to no longer give Iraqi visas, to force them to return to Iraq," said retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence may be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been driven out of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back the fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest Federated State leads in vocational training, and even shines from the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit on the Sarrois, similar to that on the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest Federated State, by self-derived, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarre training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies by a double or even a triple degree.
This shows the high rate of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
Sarre also leads the country's children to higher schools in number above the average - many of them without a degree in Gymnasium.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the professional training system," says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five youths earn their degree in a vocational school, so Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Sarrois Education has forced schools over a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparison tests in the entire federal state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of nursing is free of law - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparative studies can show whether the performance of students improve sustainably.
In PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
In total, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other Federated States.
The Bavarians are getting better.
And in spite of sarrois, foreign language knowledge is not measured by PISA studies - it might otherwise be possible to gain points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high school - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chávez sets the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon tic-tac otherwise than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will move the half-hour timer to the South American country.
Chavez eventually becomes a cartoon in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, under a new law, watches will be fixed at least four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States had imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a hostage case.
The Nationalist on the left announced that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he would not discuss relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it, just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The triggering element of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw in Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "broken at the face" of Venezuela with this decision, criticized on Sunday Chávez.
In Spain too Chávez is in all mouths.
A new mobile phone ringing is furious in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (why don't you like it) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded on the Internet.
She was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant appeals of left-wing populists and who told her to shut up.
Germany was threatened by a drop in wages in 2007.
Despite the strong conjuncture, according to a prognosis, a real minus-value of the wage threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation from Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault is the low growth in wages, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economy and Research on cyclical issues in the "Bild" newspaper.
New charges could also be made for unemployment insurance for the employee.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected fall in unemployment insurance by 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
It was noted on Tuesday that the explosion of food and hydrocarbon prices has increased the rate of inflation to its highest level for 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus is more like Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbines at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that there are flashes on Venus.
Today's "Venus Express" European probe has provided evidence - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus explode at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to Cyprine's famous theory, the lightnings would have revealed life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If life had been there, it must have been at a very old date in history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be few living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the infernal twin of the Earth, but she remains a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which resembles the Earth so much in mass and dimension, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venezuelan research, since no more probes were on the way to exploring this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles do not only highlight Venus' uniqueness within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more than expected at first.
Thus, the researchers found, in addition to the wind turbines already known at the north pole, a cloud peat at the south pole, which spins even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the currents of air in the hemispheres of the Earth in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Institute of Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet qualified as a star in the evening or in the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venetian day lasts 243 terrian days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does little remember the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have formed under similar conditions.
Of both, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has fixed itself on Earth as carbonate, it constitutes most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for the end of the party's quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs because of the attacks against the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and I think the great coalition to close the quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler said to Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the criticisms that it would organize a new Chinese policy.
The German Chancellor did not distance himself from the traditional policy of one China.
"China knows it too," Köhler said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the "provision policy" of the CDU in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese government not only commissioned the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to Spiegel's information, also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries.
The head of the Chinese government Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the reception of the Dalai-Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, supported Wen Jiabao as well as the Chinese position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that it tries to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with police, fires, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not explode on the streets through violence, the German Minister of Interior has demanded it.
Burned barricades, cassors shooting on the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) feared similar developments in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not form part of our own home and is defused into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" who appeared in Hanover.
All young people would not be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federated States and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"The summits of integration to the conferences on Islam have already shown its first success."
But it would be too early for an end of warning.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had been engaged in serious street fights with the police during the last night.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned down.
More efforts to integrate the German government, that is what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, required.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
Above all, there should be more places for training.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish Communities added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration also don't want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must still be careful."
It should be "to avoid giving young people the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter overflew the area with headlamps.
The authorities in office reported three arrests, as well as a few burned cars and trash.
Since the conference, the deployment of approximately 1,000 security forces has ensured calmness.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, almost 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles overwhelmed Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sundays.
According to the first elements of the Park, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The Utopian entry of the chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the background - and that there is nothing else to wait for from it.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After his sad speech in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of concentrating too much on politics was pushed by Angela Merkel of a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
This is provincial, she said and only showed that she does not want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made it clear to all how accurate this reproach was.
There was no real interest or feeling in the country's problems.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: an overwhelming politician, who fled into foreign politics and who even remained in the vicinity.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of oneself - having too little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now it cramps with formulas all made, that growth would affect people.
By this she destroys her image of pragmatism, which solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the empire of the cloud Angela, the problems of internal policy are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty in children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases left for this.
In this respect, the number of times it lapses when it comes to family allowance is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three startings to give a specific half sentence.
She lies in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the debate of Youtube of Republican candidates for the presidential term, both Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard offensive battle - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The pressure of candidates is already on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refugee for the clandestine," blames Mitt Romney for his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
The latter against his side with heavy reproach: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegals" Giuliani answered and blamed the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are going to attack: since the republican base has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN first and foremost to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films that Internet users sent via Youtube are hardly more than blowers.
"It's with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," John McCain launches his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly taught by Vietnam veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go from time to time beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture is seen in the reactions of St. Petersburg's joint hall in Florida.
Whether the conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, the applause goes to the auditorium.
This is where they are once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney explains, "and presents his excuses to the base and to the television audience for having been still a advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, went into a flowing knot when asked his opinion about the Bible's literary interpretations.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilians.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the armies, the man of Pakistani power Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus, eight years of military rule end.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasts live the ceremony to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had transferred his post as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus yielded to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after he took power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil state.
By withdrawing the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and of the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Soon after his investment Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayum, and thus meet another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with jurists of its ranks, had rejected all appeals last week against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy and four others injured.
According to the military spokesperson, a bomb exploded on a street near the border of Afghanistan.
Krautrock's fathers are returning.
Germany's supergroups of the 1960s are rejoining: the three members of the Harmonia Group once again took their consoles in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, recordings of their great success "Live 1974" appeared.
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced at the poster of the evening.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and first of all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, middle throne in a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked to the left of the 57-year-old Michael Rother in possession of a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, falls on his console.
Each one contributes to noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this is added by inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen too much.
The fact that the Harmonia group again played has assured some emotions among the lovers of Krautrock.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys show that, of course, the name is based on the collective memory of the pop, but in no way as long as it is sustainable for this group to be so painfully lacking for 32 years.
But why wouldn't German have the right to celebrate its living legends in the 1970s?
This is all the more so that what is called "Krautrock" has always been more pleasing in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded in 2003 the Echo award to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, we saw the German pop faces questioning in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the pagan praise, the astonishment was no longer limited.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the unknown is the only and unique.
The memory is from this fact already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during that period, the impact power that felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the cellars beneath the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Roth had recently settled in Kraftwerk and finally became a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, however, Roth was followed by Cluster musicians in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in a former Weser farm, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Komune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-called there was in the trash a fan of choral harmony Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many retain Harmony far from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
Because also serene and moderate as music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood wasn't for himself to search for himself.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as well as someone who believes to remember.
Rother gave up at that time the desire to force Harmony to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius an immoral requirement.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Roth landed in the spheres of esotericism and established his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (burning hearts).
Cluster relives in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the Live album of Griesm to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Snow! had already been buried on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Culture in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" pocket book.
There is also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmony.
Brian Eno's sentence is set in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmony in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white pictures of bazaars wired tools are used for the creation of the legend.
Before, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by hanging microphones to the organ and battery, to pull the instruments out of the sounds thanks to the instruments with effects built themselves.
Today electronic music is similar to electronic music.
The three in great technical fiction.
At that very moment the choral of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sound, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He's never been rocky.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who screams "68" is not totally wrong, and also Harmonia is now no longer irritated by it.
But what goes most of itself will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does music start and where does it end?
It can hit someone's nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Major Peace", two films again address the Balkan war.
But both don't convince.
Either the projects are too much based on action and on the exchange of nonsense or on the contrary they are too teary.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: of course the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is right there, in the darkest back country of the Bosnia War, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many nice and futile roles in women's feelings films and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism encouraged him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at even "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes hunted (why today's films should be as long and confusing as collective locomotive drivers' conventions?)
It provides a magnificent representation full of eye-clips: at the bottom, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and industry of the films were not as kind: a man who has his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a ruinous monument to his decline, has kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this excitement, "The Hunting Party" continues along with the German production "Death Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless suite of movies missed on the Balkan War.
From "murder peace" we can quickly make the trial: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar Franks, in which one of them falls soon in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs here are not presented as the only causes of all the evils, this film as flat as a television film is lost too quickly in action and the exchange of senseless shots.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why at the bottom there was never a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three U.S. war reporters, who are conditioned to track the high war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both at once Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go on small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, this becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the desert cynic with a heart, as presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to assign it more to a romantic adventure with a Bosnian who was subsequently murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes permanently bad, when the reporter, within the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, manages to ensure that NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have failed in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of Crime against Cinematographic Logic should be brought before the Hague International Court.
In this case, the film has too deep human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (where they must be exceptionally agreed) not to drive the hunt in a rather intensive way due to secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem of Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's table of work: "Compareer, I see the veins of the inflated forehead, clearly: how tired it is to be wicked."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but which insinuate how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of movies about the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films in Iraq were of big flops.
We can add that there have never been good films on South Africa.
What is worth every time: when a star drags on a crisis home or on a field of mines, then he goes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All these conflicts may still be too close in time.
In any case, decades have passed before Hollywood could make a good film on the Holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films still need to mature - those who today hold classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were never celebrated unanimously at their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know that today too simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecamb arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And that warms the screenwriters to the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" actually became so good as because Lubtisch and Chaplin still didn't know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastic artistic look and distance from the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan war, he replied: "That is only because some things never change."
"The big cities will always be awfully dangerous, the men will always be assassinated in a horrifying way and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust picks up the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The take-off of the mayor with the Hamburg candidacy for the Summer Olympics met in politics and the economy with virulent criticism.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
The head of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivation forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, political-sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new longer-term starting point, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday at his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions in Hamburg were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides to apply to the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports" said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, regarding Munich's candidacy for the 2018 winter games.
This preference means for us that, in the time period that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Sports Federation of Hamburg (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A abandonment of the candidacy would be further in contradiction with the statements of the Senate head at the plenary meeting of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's candidacy at the University of 2015 as being "not a substitute" at the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of higher schools in sport had initially been appointed Hamburg as a candidate city in the past few weeks.
The mayor's SPD fraction accused the Senate of not using this valuable time in housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the map of the Olympics and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for small Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympiads and subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "Event factor".
The candidacy for the Summer Olympics in 2012 would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken up against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols' crates.
The one that connects Sweden's concepts and wooden caisse, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or if?
At the moment, wooden caisses made in Sweden cast shadows on the list of Warhol works.
Most of the ninety-ten Brillo-Boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish "Expressen" newspaper questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the 1968 Brillo-Boxes by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museum of Stockholm leads to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", the former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave in 1995 to the Moderna Museum, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international market of art.
The ancient history is shrouded, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorical productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" soapboards.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - of hundreds of boxes made of cardboard: These were not from (for financial reasons) Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo card factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models of exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden caisses that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached sales at auctions of more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum wrongly claimed that about one hundred wooden caisses had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have given it away.
Indeed, the 105 Hultén caisses were produced only in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the curator-in-chief of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other private Swedish collections, among which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and engraved, then applied with a white oil paint brush.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals instead that the paint has been directly applied without background on the stratified panels, using a paint roll - moreover it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic painting.
"These caisses have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes", the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come from another decision, the Moderna Museum will classify the six caisses in its collection as copies/exposition material."
Already in July, Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of soap crates in powder.
But since we've been out there with an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers quit, the same ones who had retreated to a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and election fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to power had recently assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been retreating for hours in the building.
About half of them were held in court on Wednesday due to an attempted putsch missed in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the hearing to burst suddenly with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted themselves in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Hotel Peninsula and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyally powerful troops circle the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemns the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in command of the Ranger Scouts elite unit, said other military units soon wanted to join the march.
The criticism of the regime had called for a great demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded by corruption complaints for months.
The Manila district of finance has already been the theatre of the mutiny attempt by approximately 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke up about 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven attempts at puttingsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has ensured a participation of more than 20 percent of Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price per share is EUR 14,46, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of social capital would be held.
We had already speculated on a buy-out before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step, efforts are being made to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet communiqués.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the bank Berenberg increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5% to 15.1%.
The credit institution would only hold money for a third party, we report on the market.
Last night, United Internet had already acquired close to 10 percent participation in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed in the Stock Exchange 17.4 million new shares worth € 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephones.
"We strengthen our partnership," said a spokesperson from United Internet.
Both companies founded the MSP-participation company to absorb the Freenet competitor.
At the moment, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation in Freenet, and not to make use of their right to dock 18.49 percent extra at Freenet, United Internet Thursday.
However, all open options would be left to both companies, particularly to increase participation in SA Freenet, and it has been learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The yet unforeseeable poker on Freenet that lasts for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers linked to a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL clients and full subscriptions.
The United Internet Holding and Drillisch had so far a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 per cent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four per cent more.
The right to purchase 18.49 per cent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
