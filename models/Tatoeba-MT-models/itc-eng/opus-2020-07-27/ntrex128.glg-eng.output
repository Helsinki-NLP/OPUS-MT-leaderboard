The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned "to take them for Moniques"
Consternation between some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM, for the suggestion that they should change the name by the name of MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate came about by the plans to change the name of the assembly by the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all over the panorama are afraid of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was worried that the new name "reams with Twp and Pwp."
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "sniff" and "pwp" means "cuckle".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the set of the group "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the change of name, but he stressed that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the Welsh word "w" is rendered similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the "u".
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the Assembly members will depend on its own members."
The Wales Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation held on these proposals which showed great support for the name of Parliament in Wales.
With regard to the issue of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of Parliament Galés or WMP, but MWP's option received most of the support in a public consultation.
It seems the AM are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus might be a headache for the president, Elin Jones, of which the bill on changes is expected to be handed over a few weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules on the disability of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AM will get the final vote on what should be called when the debate on legislation.
Macedonians attend the polls in referendum to change their country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday if their country's name is changed to the "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote will decide to settle a dispute that has lasted for decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a complaint from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the referendum defenders, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change of name is no longer at the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent while Harlem's churches are still fighting
"The elders with whom I spoke said that before there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither one thing nor the other."
He said he could understand that the bars were gone.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to."
As for the churches, fear that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they come back where they started."
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities full of kind of people who wouldn't help the neighborhoods remain shrines.
"The vast majority of the people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, the metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved in the 1930s.
A next black congregation went to the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the shops of 125th Street, a Harlem shopping street that had resisted to hire and ascend black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they took over the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the charillon as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played carillon in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that it was the first charillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it for the largest charillon of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin's.
Those who have occupied St. Martin for the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the church's lay leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the organ that rejects the parish and is made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "asks to impact the costs" on the board, although the latter had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some Fregues complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark strikes a boy while fishing lobsters in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was fishing for lobsters in California on the first day of that crustacean season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Incinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help to scream, when he was swimming with a group of people to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only exciting to catch a lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming "They worked me!
I've been beaten!'
Hammel said he noticed when the boy got home.
"I'll shout to everyone who had come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was moved by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is admitted to critical status.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press round that they had divided a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined that it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
Officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad, until Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Musthams with beauty corridors similar to the large stores full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the beauty market in the United Kingdom, which amounts to £2,800 million and which continues to grow as fashionable sales and household products fall, the biggest corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and will then pass to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets seek to fill up the shelves that in their day occupied TVs, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those you can see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique makeup so that most products are suitable for vegans, something more and more demanded by the newer customers.
Besides, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will try concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week, while the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small shops implies that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the establishments will look more and more like shopping centers, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount shops like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced sales points from Argos and Habitat in hundreds of shops, since it has bought the two chains two years ago. By the way, this has reinforced the sales of edibles and yielded the purchases.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's put in place a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but association came to an end after a dispute over how to share drugstore income in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's selling its pharmacy business consisting of 281 shops in Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transform the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that you can turn to for advice.
Our range of products is designed to fit all the needs and the attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges the old buying habits."
Peter Jones "frozen" after Holly Willoughby retired from business of 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, has gone "frocious" after television presenter Holly Willoughby had withdrawn from an 11 million-pound business with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of household clothes and Truly accessories.
Your company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Ptrew's brand.
This Morning's 37-year-old introducer used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left the Star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones sparking himself out of his lifestyle brand in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "furiously" when the golden girl on television admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business, valued at £1.5 million, meant that he no longer had time to dedicate to the brand of house clothes and accessories of both, Truly.
The business came to be compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrew, and predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby went to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was quite different from one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be his long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left acquitted all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this Morning's presenter is among Britain's most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, because of the considerable investment in products that go from cushions and candles to clothing and textiles to the home, and that could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, united as president in March.
Couples went on vacation meetings, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter in the ITV I'm program to Celebrity.
A source close to Jones declared last night that "we shouldn't talk about their business."
A complicated conversation "and then we fell in love"
He fought with criticism from the media for making a comment that some would consider "little of a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said by putting on his voice as a telex presenter.
"I didn't give in."
He signaled that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in June in Singapore, which Trump considered a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three pesos after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, reported to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the "corresponding response" by the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he pointed out that the U.S. continues to impose sanctions directed at further pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic view of his rally speech.
"The things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"Let's go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He claimed that his efforts to improve Kim's relationships had positive results: ending up with missile tests, helping free the hostages and returning the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheatre, we'd have about 200 people standing here," Trump said pointing to the crowd who had just ahead.
A earthquake and tsunami ravages an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they didn't need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they would not seek international help, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, has ensured that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly enduring, the country is extremely ill-equipped to deal with the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it's not common to find them on other shores.
Although an alert had been issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling between many islands of Indonesia poses a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around the improvement of Indonesia's deteriorating infrastructure, and made money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a great lack of funds in the final line at the re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where most Muslim members have adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the confrontation in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the goal of the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in Chelsea with a goal at the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri still about 27 metres from Chelsea's porterage with his team losing 1-0.
He played the ball with his left leg before he shot the second stick.
The balloon flew over the area as it advanced toward the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling over an Arrizabalaga Kepa that jumped into the air and entered the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to earn as much time as possible," said Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've come to Kante and I have a touch without thinking too much and I've just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The leaders of the Blues passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning near the middle of change and entering the field of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a wall in the center of the camp.
He made a beautiful pass in depth leading Hazard to the area.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up in the second pole with a gunshot with the left that Alisson Becker couldn't stop.
Liverpool competes with Naples at the Champions Group stage on Wednesday afternoon at St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do her own with Videoton at UEFA Europe League Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian tsunami is up to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, according to the National Disaster Management Agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped among the debris of the buildings that came down with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, as indicated in a press round the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the ruined buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman had been stabbed to death
A murder investigation opened after a woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gunshot wounds on John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area to see or hear something of this step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I'd like to make a call to get in touch with any of us near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I'd also like to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to capture anything from the camera in the frame of command to contact us, since they could have key information for our research.
A police spokesman confirmed that the found body belongs to a neighbour of Birkenhead and that it was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believed to meet the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she found herself that morning.
The investigation continues as the police say it's in the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that they didn't let anyone in or out of the building.
The man ran out of words when he found out what had happened.
Residents just know they won't be able to get back in in a few hours.
A police officer has been heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
A woman crying appears on stage.
It doesn't stop saying 'it's awful'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cord watching the block of apartments.
Everyone who has information, ask you to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, who calls 101 or anonymously contacts Crimestopers at phone number 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewrite history"
Their prohibition would be poetic justice for their Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by their fanatic and Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion of "striking" and trying to rewrite the story.
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became objective.
The iconoclasty of the British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed Cromwell wrong by the actions of their forefather Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion existing in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to be still deserving of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a parliamentary defender in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not that is a complete representation is the object of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the 17th-century conflict defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A murdering pig crushes a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and murdered a farmer in a southwest China market.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the nickname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered with blood near a court in the Liupanshui market, in Guizhou province.
A piggrower is prepared to put the pigs' vaccines in a bark on May 30th and May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently she traveled with her cousin Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him another adjacent court.
He said there was a big male with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilograms, attacked the farmer to the point of killing him.
"My cousin had his legs bloody and torn apart," declared the cousin, named "Wu," to Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera recording shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed her pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police had gathered evidence on the scene.
Apparently the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Even though they're not very common, there have already been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig scurried a Welsh farmer against the tractor until he arrived at his wife and frightened the animal.
After an Orgón farmer had been devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don't usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "disparaging.
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the necessary respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring strong, generalized rains to the southwest of the United States.
The forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico flow over.
However, Rosa will take torrential rains north of Mexico and southwest of the United States over the next few days.
At 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, east, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It's expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a vald begins to take shape over the Pacific and to move east, towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm, he will begin to push tropical humidity north, which will penetrate the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico or Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the vald will create abundant and generalized rains in the southwest in the next few days.
At the local level, the rainfall of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The great tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in spot zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest are expected from 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered character of tropical rain.
We strongly advise you to venture into the desert under tropical rain threat.
The heavy rains could form cannons that could turn into floating rivers, and the thunderstorms will bring local winds torn and dust.
The wave will bring local heavy rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which could in turn cause flow of minor debris and slippery roads.
These would be the first rains of the region's wet station.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to reach Arizona at the last hours of Sunday and the first hours of Monday, before the rain extends to the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The abundant rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness great temperature fluctuations in the US due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This sometimes implies significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
The central and eastern part of the country is expected to start warm October, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates great probability of temperatures above average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the trial at Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual programming for a last-minute new Friday: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake, for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh played them when he was drunk and tried to get his clothes off at a party in high school.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that over 20.4 million people would have seen him.
The company reported the average audience at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other strings that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people who watch TV from offices.
To get an idea, it's an audience similar to a football end or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, who has greatly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement indicating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, it was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being stabbed by demonstrators when he was trying to enter an elevator on the way to the Judicial Committee hearing.
He stayed with his low look for several minutes while he was reprimanded, live television on CNN.
"I'm here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
They said, "You have power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said his office made a statement Flake, before the elevator was closed, he added that he would have more to say in the committee's hearing.
All television and cable channels were broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment before the full Senate to vote.
But Flake said it would only do that if the FBI were investigating the allegations against the nominee next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced of the conversations she had with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers Plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should raise the tariffs on the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Killed: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect from firing the shots that ended up with Wayde Sims, a 20-year basketball player at LSU (State University of Louisiana).
According to the Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned by a second-degree murder charge.
The officers broadcast the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered their glasses from the scene and claimed that they contained Simpson's DNA, as reported by the affiliate channel of the CBS, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to being the gunman who killed Wayde.
The defense reported that a bail of $350,000 was imposed on him.
The Office of the Forensics of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicates that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that has reached the neck.
The department praised the fugitives unit of the state police in Louisiana, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police are in their neighborhoods for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local law enforcement for his "dignity and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 wing was created in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball trainer Will Wade declared that the team was "thrown down" and "thrown up" by Wayde's death.
"That's what concerns us all the time," said Wade.
Volcano ash dumping on Mexico City
The ashes that cast the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano on Saturday after activity in the crater was detected and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several strongs and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of ashes in the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimlico.
The geophysicians detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southwest of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Meeting between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after Pro-Independence protesters faced the riot police and as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked proseparatists contained by the police of anti-disturbs pelted their eggs and pony painting that created dark dust clouds in the streets that tend to be filled with tourists.
There were also colds later that same day with the police, who used the rascals to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independant groups, who co-created "Ni oblivion or forgiveness", faced unionist protesters shouting "Long live to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for mild injuries received in the protest, according to the local press.
Tension continues the flower of skin in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although it is considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters have opted in a dazzling way for independence, although participation has been low and the opposite of secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at the electoral tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independence groups camped all Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place but they were forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who came to the independent demonstration with his wife, said that he no longer had hope of Catalonia achieving independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I've seen my parents cry of joy when I can vote, but now we're in trouble," he said.
Despite obtaining an adjusted victory, though decisive, in the regional elections of last December, this year the Catalan pro-independentist parties fought to maintain the momentum, with many of their leaders most known in self-imposed exile or arrested for waiting for judgment for their participation in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians from both sides.
"Every time there's more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that the following year would be presented to the elections to the European Parliament.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he assured.
Londonderry: Arrest a man after a car hit a house
three men 33, 34 and 39 years old were arrested after a car had several times landed against a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (wintertime in Britain).
Police investigation inspector Bob Blemmings declared the grid and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It's also possible that there was a bullet in the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston the 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The ascendant Livingston surprised the Rangers by taking Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as coach of the Ibriox club.
The goal of Dolly Menga was decisive for Gary Holt's team to go up a level post-Hibernian second position.
Gerrard's team still cann't sing out of the house this year at the Premiership and next Sunday they meet the leader, Hearts, from which they separate eight points.
But first the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to be invict in division by sixth consecutive match; the main coach, Holt, still doesn't know the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler by me.
Livingston escapes opportunities from weakened visitors
Holt's team must've moved forward long before the moment they scored, because with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his cross shot didn't cross the porter's threshold; then Alan Lithgow's shot went out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the porter's.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors in danger of playing ball stopped.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston made a loot in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time, Rangers dominated possession, but he was struck with an impenetrable defense that prevented a lot of work from the Liam Kelly bodyguard.
That pattern went on in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Rangers' bodyguard Allan McGregor shot Scott Pittman with his weight, and Lithgow threw the ball out in another ball played in Livingston.
Many cross-passes were provided in the Livingston area which were continuously cleared, while two requests for penalty were rejected: one by hand and one by one for Halkett's entry to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Fenamenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont to BBC Scotland from stadium Tony Macaroni
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
And unanimously, they were excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their ascending trajectory.
His style of play and players have hardly changed since he returned to the highest category, but part of merit is Holt by the way he pushed the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, led a superbly organized defense while Menga didn't give them a breath throughout the party to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers lack inspiration.
Although he worked well at times under Gerrard's orders, on this occasion they did not reach that level.
They missed the last pass, they only managed to penetrate the host team once, all of which was an aerial call to the Rangers, which is found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguity in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, who seeks to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many matters, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan approached to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocrat by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies when he collides with a car
A cyclist passed away in a collision where a car was surrounded in London.
The accident took place near the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a street traveled from Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. (wintertime in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and came the paramedics, but the man died in the act.
The accident takes place months after another cyclist died in a runaway runaway on Childers Street just over a mile from Saturday's accident.
The metropolitan police indicated that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers are injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in the high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The riot started at HMP Long Lartin from Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. (Summer Time in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A Tornado unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, in which eight inmates are involved who are in a pavilion.
The officers received attention for mild injuries on their faces.
A spokesman from the prison service said: "The staff of specially trained prisons have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time among bars."
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was known that the director of the prison facility had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot officers had to go to prison to calm down a revolt in which the staff was assaulted with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (the places affected by drought could benefit)
It's rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it's very likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southeast Desert leaving chance of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Mondays and Tuesdays of Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and that the last hour of Monday will come with rain.
The National Phoenix Meteorology Service reported in a Twitter post that only ten tropical cyclones had maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 200-mile Phoenix radio from 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended on a 64-mile radius of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service provide 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150l/m2 in the Border Mogollón in Arizona.
Other areas of the South-West Desert, such as the Central Rocks and the Great Conca could reach 25 or 50 liters, with totals being isolated of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing, for the region is very affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rains can be beneficial, because the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second largest category," saidweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will touch land on the peninsula of Lower California in Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, winding a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north at 19 km/h.
The storm is being found with cold water in the Pacific and hence losing strength.
For this reason it is expected that land will play in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or the night of Monday.
It could rain very heavily in some parts of Mexico, assuming an important risk of flooding.
"The total rainfall is expected from 75 to 150 l/m2 from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and it is possible to meet up to 250 l/m2", reports weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border at the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then he will continue going up through Arizona and entering the south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains of the sound is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the South-West US Desert," reported the National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause sudden watercourses and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder so that they found a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 4:00 a.m. (wintertime in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains stable.
According to Somerset police, three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 respectively were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the cell phone of the event.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh "suffered the petty and cholera" of the Democratic Party
"Vote by Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a rally at Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the petty and cholera" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she sexually assaulted her decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified in the trial about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that day the "Americans" were witnesses of Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best journalists of our time with a record of unpopular public service," he said addressing the multitude of admirers of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of republican results in the elections of half term.
"It takes five weeks for some of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't have to, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for big candidates."
Trump argued that the democratic mission is to "oppose and hinder."
It is hoped that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place before Friday, as CNN indicated an assistant to the Republican Party.
The earthquake and tsunami of Indonesia provokes hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke into the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival at the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke down to the ground, leading many lives and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat came, people were still with their activities on the beach and didn't run away immediately, so they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a prison round in Iacarta.
"The tsunami not only came, dragged cars, trunks, home, dragged everything I could find," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the shore.
Some people went up the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
They evacuated around 16,700 people to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs disseminated by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many tents and destroyed buildings, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued shaking the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the huge earthquake of Friday was around 200 times the nuclear bomb power launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, situated at the end of a long, narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantious" and said thousands of homes, shopping centers and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Dongula and which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "totally paralyzed and there's no information" from Dongula, he added Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there," reported the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he declared.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In a tape of amateurs shared on social networks, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming frantically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people on the street.
In a matter of minutes the water shocks against the shoreline driving buildings and cars ahead.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an important deletion that caused the cut-off of communications across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already started sending cargo aircraft from Jacarta and other cities, but evacuees continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the evacuation centers of Palu on Sunday.
The balance of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
On the way across World Vision's staff to get to Palu's city, where the employees sheltered themselves in canvas shelters erected in the yard of his office, they watched scenes of total devastation, said Mr Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he assured.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of launching assistance in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing them from traveling to Palu to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staff from abroad can flow only if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open up to international aid, but not yet."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Fridays, relatives and friends of the missing were clinging to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that would relieve the depressing argument of natural disasters."
On Saturday they took a boy out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, a trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliding players for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagei added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon reported how, in the hours following the spread of the news of the overthrow of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community, he had desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the beach festival
However, messages only showed a gray mark instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he added.
They steal $26,750 while reloading a cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was reloading a cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
In the press release, investigating officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a box in the leisure complex and prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole him a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the scene, but the police did not realize how many were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about your identities, please contact the Newport police, calling 859-292-3680.
Rapier Kanye West changed his name to Ye
Rapier Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The One known as Kanye West."
For some time now West, 41 years old, is known to the alias of Ye, who used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change took place before it appeared on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled his assistance with "emotional motives," according to the programme creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had already explained earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," said West that same year as he spoke of his album with Big Boy Radio presenter.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only, to only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
An old collaborator from West, JAY-Z, also caught himself by placing and removing the script and using the capitals.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has committed not to use military force against civilians again when the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students is approaching.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that he "would no longer use the military to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support the Mexican youth by giving monthly help to the boys who study and open more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drags the boys into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double the investment in I.A.
According to AI's professional and investor Kai-Fu Lee, former Google, Microsoft and Apple, U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lack a formal strategy about AI.
Meanwhile, China was presenting its plan the year before: it is intended to be number 1 in innovation in AI in 2030.
"Dupplicating the budget in research on AI would be a good start, since the other countries are far behind than the US, and we are looking for the next great advance on AI," said Lee.
Duplicate funding could double the probability that the next AI achievement if it was done in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is director-general of Sinovation Ventures, who invested one of the most prominent IA companies in China: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the American Othello player with a higher score and later served as executive in Microsoft Research from Google's China subsidiary.
Lee recognized ancient U.S. government technology contests as the robotic rete of the Advanced Defense Research Project Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government scholarships, says Lee.
"China is not the one leading academic leaders, but the companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university geniuses to work at AI.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. to boost its efforts at AI.
"I think they should offer residence cards to doctors at AI," he said.
The Council of State of China has published its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established an artificial intelligence centre that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the selected artificial information committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2,000 million investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, you currently invested over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the American legislation that seeks to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence hasn't registered movement in months.
The Macedonians vote in referendum if they change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to "North Macedonia Republic", a move that would resolve a dispute for decades with Greece and that blocked applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents claim that change would prejudice the ethnic identity of most of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the outcome would reach the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper was: "Is it in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name-change advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to get admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I have today come to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a number of members of parliament said that they would attack the result of the vote and that they would make it final.
The change of nine would require a majority of two-thirds of parliament.
The state election commission stated that no irregularities had been recorded at 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters deposited their vote.
"I'm going to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change of the country's name that would open the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumi, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted for those who boycotted the referendum.
"We're in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads up and not through the service door," added Kavarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will bring the much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entering the EU and NATO," Zaev commented after depositing their vote.
He said a positive result would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the requirement.
Another survey carried out by the Telma Macedonian television network indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said I'd vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since it had gained power in May of the past.
See: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses the entire Brighton defense and ends up scoreling a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took charge of Brighton's defense with Manchester City's 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple to mark the goal of the minute 65.
The Argentinian front received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading for the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He disfigured himself before he passed several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then the ball passed to his left and found Sterling.
The English foreman used the first touch area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton Mathew Ryan's bodyguard with a shot at the right of the network.
"Aguero is going through some problems on his foot," said the City coach, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky he scored at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the confrontation of the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
I got the ball at the bottom of Brighton's field in that game.
He sent a beautiful pass through the right side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite post.
The tiles put the ball in the trunk before we left the camp.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the party in the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the struggle for the elimination, there were not many reasons to force another title.
But a competitive Scherzer always hopes to launch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still implications for the Rockies Eliminating, which brings an advantage party to Los Angeles Dodgers in the western division of the national league.
The Rockies have secured at least one position of the wild with the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to close their first division title.
"Even if we don't play anything, at least we can touch the gum knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play on the highest level I played this year.
Why don't I want to compete on that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who the opener will be on Sunday, but apparently they're inclined to be what Scherzer throws in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom his start number 34 would be, made another session of bullpen on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this time.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the electorate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the outcome in the elections of half a term.
"We played everything we did in November.
There are five weeks left for some of the most important elections in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't have to do, but I really do, and that's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You've seen this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what's happening now.
And they are determined to recover power by using any means necessary, evil, and petty.
They don't care who they hurt, above who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we're never going to give it to him."
The task of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder."
"And you've seen it the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "greed, valvated, filthy and liars."
He listed the Senate's judicial committee quoting Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong applause from the public.
"Remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm. yo, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I'm not too surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a series of Labour MPs who are not well received, and all by saying our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because he faced a decisive response to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, casually about which Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a Labour Member, the meetings of Friday night's committee were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has been forgotten a long time ago, if it has ever begun.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, when fellows who believed to share a similar political vision began to expect me to portray and adopt positions that I would never agree with, whether in terms of national security as in the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly, and actually of a little like what I say, there's a tremendous rush and social media attacks censoring center policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments they tell me are usually of a political nature.
I'm impressed with the professionalism and determination of fellows who face a torrent of sexists or racists every day who don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every "untrust" movement or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower in its eyes.
Over the past few years I have received many advice that urges me to keep my head squatted, not to be so frank and that then "everything would be good for me."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there were 32 still in school, led by the neglect of the Thatcher government that had literally dropped my class, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both local councilman and government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused by my political stances and that I do not agree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who promoted Friday's motion, the only thing I'd say is that while the country walks towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy by challenging my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Invict Ayr gets in the head
The last two attempts may have somewhat altered the final result, but it is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this fine match of the Premier League of Tenent.
Now they're leading the table and it's the only unsuspecting team of the ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking him, the team took him to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we've been tested in our parties and we're still under attack, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "It must be acknowledged that Ayr has taken better chances than we have."
Grant Anderson's practice on the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put in front of the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot caught a wrong launch.
Climo increased the advantage for Ayr with a penalty, before he, just in the middle of time, turned a shot into a solo, leaving the score 17-5 in favour of Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started well the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop by the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which left the field in padiola and, since the re-start, Ayr has advanced more through a Stafford McDowall trial, transformed by Climo.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card, and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with an unconsumed Bruce Colvine essay, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the local team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for plating Climo when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson marked a trial from the penal line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo marked, as he did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe collected the release into the David Armstrong area and had sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth essay from the local team.
Still Game protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game Star, Ford Kieran, seems to be ready to join the restoration industry after finding out he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, who writes and co-protagonizes with his old partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next 9th season will be the final, and it seems that Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, even though a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's own restaurant business.
'The sea is ours': interior Bolivia hopes that the court will be on its way to the Pacific.
The sailors watched a naval thirst covered with apparatus in La Paz.
The public buildings are wearing a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are added to the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
Getting it back is a duty."
In Bolivia without sea, the reminder of a lost coast to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict is still alive, just as the desire to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes are at their peak in decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see CIX's sentence on giant screens all over the country in the hope that the Hague Court will take action in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate the concession of Bolivia to a sovereign sea escape.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic Indian president, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, is also at stake on Monday's sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts find it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory, and it has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the CIX sentence comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," states Chilean expert in international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years could have delayed her.
"The topic of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate says.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have had no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken an unusually quick decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, even one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, had been using this subject for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can be trusted in the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong states that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment occurs at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to reboot stagnated nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri claims it's "a utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korean War can double the North.
In Washington, they refuse to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is the generalized scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second cumio Kim-Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the shops.
Whether you want to increase your collection of hats or not to cover the entire sun, do not look again.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the gateway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that opened up the public in the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers pull their most amazing creations out of the gateway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated blue hat adorned with a wide blade imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large-sized accessories there were dirty sandals, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving team, with glasses and tube, and others a melted ice cone.
And if they're fashionable with the huge, you're lucky.
The fashionable understanding predicted that giant caps could reach the shops.
The disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomb", the straw hat with a six-inch blade that takes everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the impossible hat that invades all the social networks has taken another great creation to the gateway: a beach bag of straw almost as big as the attached model with a bathing suit that takes it.
The orange raffle bag decorated with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather wings, was the highlight piece of the spring 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera on Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I hope the hats and big beach bags arrive at the shops next summer, since the designer had such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories'.
John Edward: Linguistic Skills Are Essential to World Citizens · Global Voices
Private schools in Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer students and their parents the best level.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for their chosen career and place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue to be a popular and desired theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, that crumples his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he'll reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of recent exams this year, we can see that the languages are at the top of the board and at the highest approved rates in private schools.
About 68% of students who studied foreign languages got an outstanding one.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up SCIS, shows that 72% of students obtained honorary registration in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of them who studied French and 63% of them who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
At present, languages are having the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all kinds of school programs.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that the lack of language knowledge accounted for 17% of the reasons why employers have to fill their vacancies.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare for youth for future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of your chosen career, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with a life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% didn't speak any foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the languages of education differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others become more important languages for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of their children's interests, private schools always have several languages to choose and specialized teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may tell them.
We cannot deny that at present, in a global business environment, languages are still of vital importance to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of private schools.
Lebron starts with Lakers or Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the evenings that want to see LeBron James playing with Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
The team coach, like Walton, announced that James will play the first pre-time match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still about to decide how many minutes he'll play.
"It'll be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After early week training, they asked James about his plans for six Lakers matches.
At this point in my career I don't need pre-time matches to be ready," he said.
Trump's election acts arrive in Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump's 5 scheduled matches for the next week, including stops in cities close to him like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a standing confirmation vote for your candidate to fill the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump seeks support for the next half-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today on September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's rally in West Virginia following via live stream via YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with the subject of the trial held this week to the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense about the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who keeps the Senate's confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of rallys is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
So these five myths that Trump will give next week are aimed at "denying volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," says Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to your schedule that the president will travel to as many states as possible towards the campaign season," said Reuters a Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be appointed.
The rally tonight, which will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage of the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate of West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist from the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive to individual Sunday parties
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse oscillating pendulum is a totally invented concept of sport but what sportsmen really believe in, and above all in competitions like this.
So, where would they say the impulse is now?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now they're four, so I suppose we take that as a little boost," said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, said Spieth, feel they have a bit of wind in favor and much so to cheer up, among other things, the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each one with three points of four.
Spieth came fatal from tea to green and is preaching with the example.
Those guttural screams became stronger as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth match when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
By getting the putt that got them to win the game in 15, he made a similar scream, the kind of scream that says he thinks the American team isn't still out.
"Just focus and worry about your party," said Spieth.
It's the only thing that's left for these players now.
18 holes to leave glued.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four of four and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way it seems to flow its energy into the crowd and from it, confirms them how the rivals hit on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to win a victory when the sun goes over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly sent Sergio García, the morning fourball hero, when he paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first tour ended up with Spanish and Swedish in a hole of which they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there won't be anyone to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see close by the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the way they don't, and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team up to now and they have a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA has a hard time fighting, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has an advantage of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and the foursomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired two made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to climb four points to the scoreboard in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who seeks to preserve the trophy that they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the 3-1 series.
U.S. offered more resistance in the ants, winning four matches, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to earn four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to earn four points from the four initial matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the quaballs, they fit perfectly to defeat an unloaded Woods and the American novel Bryson Dechambeau with 5&4 more categorical.
Woods, who fought two matches on Saturday with no penalty or glory, showed occasional bursts of brightness, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in the modalities of fourballs and foursomes and five followed.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning fourballs, rejoined his partner Henrik Stenson in the ansomes picking up a defeat in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in southwest Paris.
Three times champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the point of reference for the Americans getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and won back Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in the story of Ryder Cup where a team dates up four points in the individual, although as the current holder of the trophy, Furyk's team only needs to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Cora says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions increased its mistrust in the United States and that the country would not give up its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps to show its goodwill" last year, like stopping nuclear tests and missiles, dismantling nuclear testing camps and committing itself to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see the response from the US," he added.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament on our part first."
As Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, its statement seemed important, as it did not refuse unilateral denuclearization as had occurred with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump on the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader celebrated in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula while Trump guaranteed security for North Korea.
North Korea has been looking for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal of coercive action, and even if they oppose the "declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the sanctions continue to acquit us of our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the American leader mentioned in the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "evil president" Trump called Kim "man rocket on a suicide mission."
This year in the UN, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that there is still a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday Trump said there was no time limit for that, and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, however, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that: "The compliance with the sanctions of the Security Council must continue firmly and without exception until we observe the total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds into Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then remarked that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had advanced, just a few hours after North Korea had denounced him for making "mafia-like demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took the "relative measures".
He signaled that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he requested were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and the advance towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all of your students sleep more in order to combat the growth of the machist culture of studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
An academic found that university students number one in the world often don't know the basic aspects of how to take care of them.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Muller, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after giving a talk about the impact the lack of sleep had on learning.
"At the end of the course a girl approached and said to me, 'Why do they only tell me this now, in my last year?'
He said that no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," commented The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits help with academic and athletic performance, as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour duration involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are informed of how prolonged sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what health effects they are if we choose to smoke tobacco," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride of spending all night still exists, says, and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students who were lacking sleep was a growing problem.
To ensure that he sleeps long enough and that he has a good quality sleep must be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he points out. He even avoids fattening, because lack of sleep causes the brain to enter mode of inanition, which makes him constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course across the campus.
The next step, wait, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to lie down as well as when they wake up. Similarly, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: the goal of Menga overthrows Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibox's team intended to record his first home win since his 4-1 victory in February at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team led to Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left his team eight points behind Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a low-inspired alignment of the Rangers never made it feel like he was drawn.
While the Rangers went down to the sixth post, Livingston went up to the third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a goal of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had had to have dealt with by a wound on his head after the supposed launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that dragged Ayr into the semi-finals of Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 Livingston who drew a point to Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organized group suffocated its opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They might have marked in just two minutes when Menga's first-time short pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's office, but the midfielder missed this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot of Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to tie him in the second stick.
The Rangers took over, but they seemed to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
No doubt Alfredo Morelos felt he should have pitted the penalty at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless hit, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only shot the door in the first half, but the old guard of Ibriox, Liam Kelly, only had problems with the end of Lassana Coulibaly's head and the attack of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute might have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again in facing Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher attached the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his blood cold to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at rest when he changed Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, change which almost had an immediate effect when the left one made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued devouring visitors by playing exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long balloon after another.
Holt's team might have extended the advantage at the end of the day, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers' substitute, Glenn Middleton, has claimed another penalty to be angry with Jacobs, but Thomson has made his sight look fat again.
Almanaque: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136, and I counted today... was the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A piar of science since then, Count Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
By putting these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactive activity of minerals."
Evans: "Say, it's bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient by altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovaries cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "impresses the growth of various types of cancer," including those of breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the removal of immune cells from patients and "testinals" to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump using a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance in the program Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result wasn't good.
During a program on Saturday Night Live, Kanye West was stabbed in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, where he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and say, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?"
If I were worried about racism, I'd have been out of the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the program with a satire star star star starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual assault demands made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it hasn't been issued, Chris Rock has gone up the images from West's criticism to social media.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of his cap.
"They passed with me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
I was intimidated!
And then they said I was going to pick up," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pike?" saying that he would "put on my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do." Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments sparked a blow in the audience at least twice and the members of the SNL cast seemed ashamed, he informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave to the publication: "All the study was silent at all."
They had appointed West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people perplexed by an interpretation of the song I love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West obtained the support of the TPUSA Conservative Group leader, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for doing FRONT MAFIA"
However, the host of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was just "being who it is and that's completely wonderful."
"So and everything, I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "the being officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The accused is expected to appear before the Court of Maxistrades of Belfast or Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
The Star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its role of sword management as Jon Snow in the violent medieval series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a machist hero, saying that these roles on the screen are translated into that it seems that young people often have to be hard to respect.
When talking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo (#EuTamén).
Kit, who recently married to Game of Thrones co-protagonist Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she felt "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now, when we're wrong with masculinity?" she said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up in terms of the problem we'll see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, clearly, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not do any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, claiming that "basis of horses and battlefields."
As of November, Kit will lead a true West (the true west) reposition of Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he thought his meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this program, so somehow she provided me with my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects over 820,000 people in the country, the health authorities have declared.
40.000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, inter-annually, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV poses a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sexual intercourse with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters condescends that a staff member leaked data from the senators of the Republican Party, "dangerous lies" and "complaining theories"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three senators of the U.S. Republican Party on Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democratic Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultrarighte".
" Lies, lies and more infamous lies," Waters commented in a statement on Twitter.
According to it, the widespread information included the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtration appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed information from a staff member of Waters, reported Capitol Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were committed as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible in any way for filtration of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie."
The Waters declaration immediately aroused online criticism, including those of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This lying was angry," wrote Fleischer.
"You understand he has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something they haven't done, they mustn't get angry.
Should not be challenging.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
It must remain appracticable and serene."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction with the criticism of the Democrats of Juíz Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to unbank Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it was true" shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said that his department warned "the law enforcement authorities and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent accusations.
"We'll make sure we find out the culprits," he continued, "so that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all of my team members."
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in action), the powerless spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and action comedy by Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire become about the issue of the obviously stupid that we are in the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, Johnny English's incompetent eye character and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comic creation designed for non-anglophone cinematic territories.
Of course, it is the silly secret agent who, despite his strange claims of adulation glamorous, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a piece of that type that contributed with a single note on the topic of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once interpreted in the now forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, in which he sowed chaos in his passage.
There's a couple of good moments at Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval suit of armor and the struts of the rotor make a brief crash against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps to the eye, but it gives the impression that humor is weak and strangely superfluous, especially when these types of "serious" movies, like 007 and Impossible Mission, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed at children, instead of adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misfortunes are not as clever or concentrated as Atkinson's film jokes change by incarnation of Bean's character.
Now the constantly topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates Britain's supersecret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the anguish of the agent on duty, a unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the summit for a prime minister in conflict, who has already suffered a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character who almost looks Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your informatory intelligence advisors that as all active spies have committed themselves, they must remove someone from the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but gives extra-official lessons about how to become an infiltrator agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and gather with their old and suffering fellow Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit lost.
So the Batmans and Robin of the mistakes of His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, striking the beautiful fatal wife of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is succumbing dangerously to the charm of the multi-millionaire technological charismatic that claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hate of ridiculous falcatruades: dressed as waiters, set fire to a hostile French restaurant; create a riot that illegally puts them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize himself with the inside of the House of Volta.
Of course, all arrests come out of this last sequence, but in a kind and shocking way, it looks like a child's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, like other Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking: Can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies it's drawing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but cover for five.
Supposedly, the party wants entrepreneurs to spend their savings through the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "fit up" the party's economic agenda and its plans to incline the country in favor of workers.
The Trade Union Congress supported four-day shifts a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that adjusts to the party's focus to balance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as to the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
Even so, the Labour Party today does not support ambition in its entirety.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said, "A four-day workweek doesn't enter the party's politics and it's not being considered by this party."
The chancellor in the shadow, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr.McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The plans of the chancellor in the shadow also imply the possibility that current water company shareholders will not recover their entire investment, since a Labour government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on business councils and to create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees, who embolden annual dividends for up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are saying "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court.
On Sunday, at an interview, the reporter of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring them to light something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after he got out of the charge and asked him if he had.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems to be unmovable.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is decided and would make an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett flatly denied it," added Graham in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people he mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive star poster that will act and an equally impressive mission, ending world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people come in command to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the poverty-ending event before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively combat it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the 12-year-old Global Citizen to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a great way to persuade people to ask for action or is it just another case of the so-called "clustivism", people who think that it makes a difference when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, pushing a set of different goals.
He claims that these actions helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and ads derived from their shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK company of investors and executioners who have committed to "help children develop to their maximum potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, the donors, the national authorities and Global Citizen sympathizers like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funds for the project The Power of Nutrition that will reach 5 million women and children with interventions on nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied, "It will be a long and difficult way and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way that happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will play this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to make a "block" to hinder energy exports from Russia, U.S. Interior Secretary announced
"If necessary," Washington may resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, as cited by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe," he said, as he reports.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, along with the sea, to ensure that seaways are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called himself the "power consumer's voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, considering that in practice it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of using and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying that "it has only a tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia's, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow's "cative".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 of $11 billion pipeline, which was established to double the capacity of the existing oil pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a mere economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is argued only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said the Russian Energy Minister, Aleksandr Novak, after the meeting with the US Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, which took place in September in Moscow.
The US position got Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry's leading organization, the German Federation of Industry (BDI) has appealed to the US to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine his candidacy for the presidency in 2020, said Senator of Massachusetts
On Saturday, the senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said she would carefully examine her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the government fracture and that includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency."
Warren thought about President Donald Trump during the public meeting, saying he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren's own voters don't think it's going to be presented by 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts's "probably" voters said the senator would not apply, according to the survey by the University of Suffolk's Political Research Center and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the candidacy of the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other outstanding names of the Democrats in connection with a possible candidacy in 2020 include the former vice president, Joe Biden, and Senator de Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially before January, he informed the agency Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites the post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) of Track Palin no myth of Donald Trump
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence.
"With what my own son is going through, with what is happening again, I can see myself reflected in other families feeling the consequences of TEPT and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," he explained to the audience at a rally of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo issue and that his son and other war veterans, "they become different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what the fellow militiamen and aviators, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the Columbia District defy the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a judicial remedy in relation to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district presented a court friendly report in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff of the Grace v. Sessions prize that the American Civil Liberties Union (U.S. Union for Civil Liberties) filed in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but the U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She's been arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers for the United States, as nations that face generalized problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be adjudicated in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and the prohibition violates that principle" was explained in the court's friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants is damaging the US economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and to "supply labour".
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions declared in their political announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems (including all serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a career to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma's mother, comforting her febrile baby at the evacuation center of Palu's ravaged city.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their consecrated belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured the back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he had shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in the city.
"I listened to my wife asking for help and, afterwards, only silent.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of abuse with "propagandistic announcements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper posted a four-page announcement on a U.S. daily begging for the benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, made reference to the payment supplement China Daily on Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of entering the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections, marked what the officials of that country coined in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an ever-increasing trade war as a witness to tariff levels in their respective imports.
According to China and USA experts, China's compensatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of China's leading exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing harmed workers, farmers and American entrepreneurs.
In an opinion paper written by Branstad and published in the edition of the Moines Register, China "is intensifying this harassment campaign by spreading propaganda in the Free American Press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the popular American tradition of freedom of speech and the press by publishing a payment announcement at Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the newspaper post at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese may have on the worrying economic trajectory of China, since the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he claims that "one of China's most important journals declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm what the paper is.
Kavanaugh's disaster makes women's Republican vote a few days from half-term elections.
Although many of the leading Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the different accusations of sexual assaults, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially female voters, in the next half-term elections.
The reactions to these accusations were numerous and most Republicans were positioned to proceed with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell school at Syracuse University in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that it is doubtful that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation is enough to calm the spirits of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget what happened in the near future or in November," thought the Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, the flu of "Arcase november!", appeared in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, under the control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratics' motivation and enthusiasm will overcome any expectation," he assured the site of reports Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It's true that he's already tall,
But it's still going to be more, especially among the indecisive voting women in the neighborhoods or those who are between 18 and 29 years of age, who, even though they don't like the President, don't usually go to the polls."
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing his accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested that it was possible to have a violent reaction if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early in the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the committee's vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the accused's bank or not, the problem is how the Republicans managed it and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of priorities USA, a group that helps the Democratic election on the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided between whether to believe Ford's testimony or that of Kavanaugh, even though they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents fully or probably believe the testimony of Ford, compared to 35% supporting the testimony of Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30% who thinks the same about Ford.
Following the pressure exerted by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's accusations, as well as those of at least another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of horror when she was 17 years old.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a university party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrut, the last project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, Berners Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee lucky that the intention to hide Inrupt is to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own online personal data storage or POD.
Contact lists, to-dos lists, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available on a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has a complete control over who can access what information.
The company qualifies this as a "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to his president John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer developers.
From this week on, developers from around the world could create their own decentralised applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would modify his business models from day to day.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has stood up as an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee is still the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Homage to Bernard Vann, a clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman in the Church of England who was decorated with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded September 29, 1918, in the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been granted the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were in charge of discovering a memorial monument in his honor in a parade in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the feat of his grandfather who deserved the title.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin channel "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gunfire."
Later he hurried to get to the line of fire and, with "great courage," he led the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and bring down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson yet."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put in a crown of flowers after the parade, which led the Brentwood Imperial youth band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genius hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts MMA amateurs the roll at the best time
Imagine you've been awake all night to enjoy Bellator 206's full show, and when the best part comes, something prevents you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 combats, six of them major, and was broadcasting live in the United Kingdom in Channel 5.
But on the 6th of the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald would see their faces, the United Kingdom spectators were amazed when they saw Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed by it after having spent so many hours awake waiting to see the struggle.
An amateur described the change to these child cartoons on Twitter as "a joke of very tasteful."
"State legislation refuses that this content was inappropriate for 6 a.m., and that's why it had to be changed to children's programming," explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Marketing and Bellator's Communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said they'll take UK viewers into account in future programming.
"I think we can fix it when we think of repetition," said Coker.
"But if it's 6:00 a.m. there, we can't fix it until Sunday, which will already be Monday to them.
But we're working on finding a solution.
When the change came, I started receiving a lot of messages and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six.
Gives us a lot of anger."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he's grown up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
Invited of the first broadcast of the Desert Island Radio Discs 4 program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is on sick leave.
As a guest of the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "lower" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked children and girls."
Even so, he said, "That feeling of inferiority and being different is what pushed me and gave me the strength to achieve success."
I wanted to prove that I was "someone" so people wouldn't feel disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Commonwealth games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to talk because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said he was in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was a surprise."
Daley married this winner of an Oscar last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so much in such a short time" (with only 14 years of age you first participated in Olympic Games and your father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who had experienced similar heights.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley totally change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are things far more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
Your son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son to do were tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
"I haven't been able to tell you that I wouldn't be here to fill that first row," Daley shared.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was at that precise moment, at the time of his death, when I realized that he wasn't really invincible," he adds.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that this was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no feeling better" she confirmed.
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is not in vain either, since it's the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on top of it.

A low-form Miccelson ended up at Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday.
U.S. Phil Miccelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup party, but he will have to improve his technique so that this doesn't turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed at the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or the forts on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many other times for the United States, the five times champion spent the day cheering up and working to improve his movements.
Although it was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the high point in his career, at the age of 48 he doesn't fit into the adjusted Le Golf National field, where the tall grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And in case this wasn't enough, Micchelson stood up in the ninth Sunday match to the exact Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below when they start the 12 individual matches, they start with a good foot, Miccelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he could not say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he played today, gave me a slap on my shoulder, held his arm, and told me that tomorrow he would be ready," Furyk shared.
"He fully trusted himself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end that's the way it is, and so we think it should be.
Like everybody else wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played at Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual scarf.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangible to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with genius and he likes to get into people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he said.
"I like to see how well the younger players had spent with him this week.
He's much more like a good player."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last hour of Ryder Cup individuals can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danes debuted in 1997 in a match in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seven Ballesters had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended up at the finish line with a minimal advantage winning 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderrama; as in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won by little," Bjorn reflected, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 on the Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go after all.
We have to get out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the bookmarks are on the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won't get tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of his players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before.
Tomorrow we faced the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a partner next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then put your ability as a golfer to the fullest.
That's the message you need to send to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for their players to have a better individual performance than their peers, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those last day turns, being part of the winning team on Brookline, but ending up as a loser after a European miracle in Medina."
"I remember every one of those damn words," he answered when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players towards the last day.
"We have 12 important matches, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brookline's or Medina's.
When you see the impulse going in a direction, there's a lot of pressure in those middle parties.
We prepare our alignment taking this into account and placing the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, at the top half of the ranking.
"I've decided this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn explained about his selection for the individual.
The new German warship postponed once more
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not reach at least next year due to defective systems and increasing cost, they reported the local media.
The post in service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of the flaming frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman to newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-heroe and anti-bucos missiles, as well as concealing technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to spread the younger frigates up to two years outside the original ports.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continued delays mean that the warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be old-fashioned when they enter service.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a builder after the delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind this return, but the German media talked about "Cricial flaws in software and hardware" that prevented the use of the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
It is thought that the 7 thousand-ton Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the ships of class as the Germans used in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it already reaches the amazing amount of 3100 million euros, compared to the initial 2200 million.
The problems of the newer frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making water.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships capable of spreading.
The officer claims that this problem is getting bigger and bigger, because old ships have been removed, but not replaced by others.
Even so, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust spyes on the secret life of bats
A new research that is being carried out on a highlands farm in Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to look for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bat Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the Invewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed on key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An analysis of sound performed by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of calls from bats and that is making each species.
A habitat map will then be drawn to create a detailed picture of the landscape scale of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results show that habitat areas are more important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and the loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and lighting also pose a risk, as well as traps with fly glue, some chemical treatments of building materials and attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in hunting.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic surveys, inspections of children and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization even has the only and first reserve of Scottish bats in Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the state manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Thrave we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to prosper."
Stresses the importance of controlling bats before performing maintenance tasks in the properties, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity child can kill up to 400 females and infants, which could exterminate a whole local population.
The bats are a protected species and it's illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as to destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"There is still much to learn about bats and, in the case of many species, we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims and his lawyers prepare to sue for German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that all people want is to get to know each other by using his name.
Your lawyers will sue German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these charges.
The head of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It's more likely that the footballer paid the woman $375,000 so she didn't say anything about the incident, published Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after his release, 33-year-old Ronaldo has shut down this fake news on a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
"No, not and not a thousand times.
What is said today is false," he said to the camera five times the winner of the Golden Ball.
"People want to get to know each other by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for just saying my name, it's part of my work.
I'm a happy and respectable man," added the smiling player.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which qualify as "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the privacy area" according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of the personal rights of the past few years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After he met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her annually, according to the documents presented at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, kneeled down saying he was 99% a knight, but that 1 % had betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that they both had sexual intercourse consented by both parties.
Mayorga also claims he went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later he reached an extrajudicial agreement because he felt terrified by the reprisals and was worried about the public ridicule.
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to revoke the deal while she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian Giant Juve in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Automobile manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of its position as a world leader in the manufacture of automobiles after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had stated in the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production of its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"It's necessary to reach an agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit had not reached any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which is responsible for manufacturing the Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced some 150 000 vehicles last year, from which 90 % was exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses of how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of trade between borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his Mini plant at Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in case there is no agreement in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very tight, and every 37 minutes parts of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU arrive for custom-made cars.
If on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement, the border could be affected and there could be delays and shortage of pieces.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to keep a normal pace more than a day on Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark states that Theresa May's Czechs plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid such border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best deal, so that we can enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity," stated BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota could not estimate how long the production would stop, but warned that in the long term, added costs would reduce plant competition and even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Burnaston's employee for 24 years and United union coordinator, said that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
One government spokesman said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be welcomed again
The White House stated that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and the Under-Secretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed a week longer because of the fight by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, the links between Russian and Trump assistants, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the attached Attorney General, or not, which would jeopardize Mueller's independence, he fed the rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record the conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President by amendment 25.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he came to the White House, among reports that they indicated he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to prevent a shock from the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation to the FBI about the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Before the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied, "There's not a fixed date yet, it could be this week or be delayed another week, given all that's going on in the supreme court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press to be informed."
Some journalists have questioned that claim, since Sanders has been here since September 10 without having a press conference.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders stated that the lack of information session was not due to an aversion to the grandioseness of reporters, even though he added that it would not be her who denied that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not quote any source that would swallow that data.
They will continue to hold briefings, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that's much better than to address the questions to her.
You are witnesses of how we've been doing this for the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can speak directly to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, lonely press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions to the journalists gathered.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm down before Brexit
The Health Secretariat addressed a letter to the EU workers in the NHS in Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and conveying their wish to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish government has undertaken to cover the cost of applications for EU citizens working in their decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this fall.
However, the government of the United Kingdom, for its part, has also intensified its preparations for a possible situation of disagreement.
I know this is a time of concern for everyone.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Fellows in the European Union, and beyond, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury during the defeat of Saturday (31-27) in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, informed Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State coach, informed the journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he passed out when he got to the band line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a shirt to perform a subsequent evaluation.
A technician from Tennessee State informed Chris Harris, WSMV journalist at Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Even so, he added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when this injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year Red T-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries in total on Saturday before he left the game, which raised to 18 his total season.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralise the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasure expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May announces that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money raised will be used to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people who sleep on the street.
The charging, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second houses and purchases for rent, may be up to 3 %.
Fairy expects the change to be able to collect up to £120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of the new constructions in London are sold by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulties in accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson requested the application of a cut in the tax on the transmission of farms to help new people acquire their first house.
He accused the large builders of keeping the prices of high housing by buying soil and not using it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenue on moderate-priced houses to repair the "worship of the housing sector" living in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of housing-related reform proposals, including the control of renters and the ban on defiance where the lodger is not guilty.
He also wants to grant the larger municipalities powers in building new housing.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it's necessary to repair the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
It's not fair, however, that it's just as easy for those people who don't live in the United Kingdom as well as for businesses based on the foreign market to buy housing than for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity it is not to have a roof remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland"
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, stated that his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's picker at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotsman is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club in the northwest, which currently occupies the third square in the League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in selection B, and that was all," Ross told BBC Scottish Sportsund.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I'm successful in running a club."
Ross' predecessors in the position of Sunderland coach include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic claims that he felt no concern about the success of those figures so consolidated in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me will depend at this time if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly own to a Premier League club," he said.
"It won't be a simple task to arrive, but it's likely to just consider that I've achieved success here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross has only been a trainer for three years after an assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period within Hearts' technical staff.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St Mirren from being about to go down and win the title of the Championship at the next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he's ever encountered during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"I was probably at a real crossroads," he recalled, about taking over the Alloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange because it wasn't wrong for me, I've reasonably won life and enjoyed some successes.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you must overcome every week.
I keep suffering from them in relation to stress and pressure from work, but I like to train.
I've always liked to train and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a paint is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday
The heat wave of summer increased consumption in the British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent growth during July, but consumption in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of CGA's trade council, who was responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's stay in the world of football for longer than expected resulted in a pattern similar to that of June, in which the pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, even though the restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the turnover of restaurants during June worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specialized in beverages were the best results obtained with higher consumption increases than reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specialized in meals also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the pubs and bars controlled drinking increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food was reduced by three percent."
Paul Newman, an employee of the RSM company for analysis of leisure and hospitality activities, said: "These results assume a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since the end of April.
The time and impact of the main social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 per cent annually will be particularly painful if this is added to the continuous increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have come at a worse time for the restoration business and the time will be responsible for saying whether the moderation of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the much needed breathing for the sector."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of brands.
The UK's Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with joint benefits of over 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector's benchmark.
One out of five children has secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children (some only 11 years old) has secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers from a survey
A survey conducted at 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "False Intest"
This news has led to an increase in the fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents
One out of five children (some only 11 years of age) are creating accounts on social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "False Insta" accounts (referred to the Instagram social photo exchange network).
This news has caused an increase in the fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they were using a softened "primary" account to show their parents while they had other privates.
A mother who was in touch with her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked her to be raped.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's head Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vote of the athletes" on the council of the Scottish athletic federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish athletic federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who drive sports to benefit from their wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys an enormous respect within the Scottish community, the United Kingdom and worldwide, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from its incorporation into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm very keen on being an athlete's spokesman and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four Olympic golds and who currently works as a usual commentator for BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "I've been suffering from an apoplexy a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only the time could determine if I could recover and until I did.
It was a exhausting job, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and now I do exercises of axility.
Thank you for the courage messages."
An announcement of a milk extractor in relation to women with cows divides public opinion into networks
A company of milk extractors divided public opinion into networks with an ad in relation to nursing mothers with milking cows.
To announce the launch of the so-called "first silent portable milk extractor from the world," Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new milk extractor to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ugly for cows at the rhythm of a song with letters like the following: "Yes, I muse myself, but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not boobs, they're my breasts."
The chorus goes on: "Woman, girl, I'm feeding babies, I'm feeding babies, I'm milking my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 playbacks and hundreds of comments, the video triggered different reactions among viewers, many of them claim that this post reveals the "sorry" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to announce this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after giving birth," wrote one.
Elvie's milk extractor can be quietly placed inside a mother holding (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented the following: "Claredly traumatic for the mother and baby.
But why aren't they used to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What an announcement with so little touch."
Other spectators defended the announcement, even one woman said that the song seemed "very funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Getting my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I played it like a joke.
I think it's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement directed to mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like "vacas".
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has neither cables nor tubes, and you can discreetly fit into a motherly bra, which gives women freedom to move, subjects their babies, and even go out there while they're extracting their milk.
Mother's partner and executive creative director Ana Balarin commented: "Elvie's extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a daring and provocative launch.
In describing the parallelism that exists between women and milk cows, we want to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges that it involves while demonstrating in an entertaining and close manner the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time the Elvie extractor takes the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children emigrated silently to a camp at the border of Texas
The number of detained emigrants increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively invariable, partly due to the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign godparents to children.
Traditionally, most of the godfathers were also immigrants without papers and were afraid to endanger their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the possible fathers and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that that data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the United States Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified to Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who asked to patrol minors without company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 percent of the people who are godfathers or who are part of the home of these people are found illegally in the country, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to prosecute children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules that would require one of these to appear in the trial before a month has elapsed since their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers of the shelter.
Many will appear by videoconferencing instead of in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent seizures or attempts to escape by the workers of the shelter and reports of the system published over the past few months.
Lawyers have claimed that these fears increase in centers of greater dimensions than Tornillo, in which there is a greater possibility that the symptoms of a child having a bad time go unnoticed because of its size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends might lead to trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
The Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the office of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were illegally found in Syrian soil, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he informed the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clean up all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "out of all illegal foreign presence."
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in this country devastated by war.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions appropriate for his return were given and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We went to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not offer aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition took place to end the war.
The UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone on the last great rebel side of Idlib allowed the political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions would be destined for the Jihadists, including the soldiers in the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
The envoy of UN Staffan of Mixture hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draw up an outline of a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would be able to re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of a presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, pre-time audience rates have multiplied by more than two, up to 1.05 million viewers in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, an increase of 1.7 million compared to four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led cable channel audiences with 3.5 million spectators during the nights when important news occurred.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, showrunner of the drama for the ABC "Designified Survival", who deals with a secretary from the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told you that he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked him.
"He answered, 'Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There is entertainment inside chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the plots that govern Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if emigrant families can rejoin themselves and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Still, it assumes something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spends six hours watching a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather bomber jacket ("an arrogance-filled coat," said Washington Pos) and the implications of the scalable descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the changes in characters and daily argumental turns of the Trump show (the conflict with the N.F.L., the compliments to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll stay behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, he was in the sun and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house, on the North Coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while I was recording CNN.
He wasn't able to hang out while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back then and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money comes to more to finance the House's candidatures for the election of half the legislature
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a district of Congress with two representatives in career functions to occupy the same position.
This district located outside Pittsburg which was recently reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who won his post in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is against another acting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is superimposed to a large extent over the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined in January that the Republicans manipulated the electoral district of the old districts in their favor.
The election career in the new 17th congress district triggered a campaign financing festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congress Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after reaching an adjusted victory in the March special elections to the 18th district of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide follow-up.
That post was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
The political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States appreciated the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support to China and then went back
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners launched the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to return to heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in O Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "new decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Department's spokesman in a statement made this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctions against O Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in US aid during 2017, included to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was fought.
The penalties proposed, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent emigration of people into the United States.
But in mid-September, important government officials made it clear they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions for O Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to conduct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance of administration, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to O Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson from Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations as long as the participants' anonymity is maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was retained.
Study History
The next negative case could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction of Mr Trump's justice, of which there are currently abundant evidence in the public archive.
According to the record, Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump's campaign has conspired with Russia in his attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to render accounts in that body, just when he has to prepare for the elections, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are many unknown and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable, as is that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a coup against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killings that followed.
The course of history revolves around these inflection points, and the inexorable advance of democracy is accelerating or shrinking.
The Americans are facing several of these inflection points at the moment.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the State Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has carried the water up to her neck since this paper reported that last year she secretly suggested recording to the president and speculated that she was incapacitated.
Mr. Rosenstein has stated that The Times' information is not true.
"How will we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the criminal charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, above all, will we vote in the half-legislation election for a Congress that demands Mr Trump's responsibilities?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we won't fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which was well known from the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to put shabat candles on that table that included a schism.
With that inheritance, how am I not going to be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans player is optimistic about meeting the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receives Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the stunning tie achieved in Spain against the Villarreal this month, would put them in a very favourable position to be classified in the G group of Europe League.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from kicking this season up to the 2-2 draw in front of the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a trap to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, since Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the party believing that we could get something positive and reach a point.
We had the chance to win at the end, but in general, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope we can reach all three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last party, but with the support of our audience, I'm sure we can fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year it was hard among all that happened to my injuries and the changes that happened on the team, but there's an excellent environment right now.
The team's good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget last season and be successful."
Women worry about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had made it clear how they wanted them to be cared for, few people spoke with their family about it.
Approximately half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide stated that they commented with their partners on the cost of extended care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to look after her as a family member, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance department.
You can start with the next one.
Talk to your spouse and children, you can't prepare your family to take care of yourself if you don't communicate your wishes to them in advance.
He collaborates with your advisor and your family to wake up where and how to receive care, since those decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor. Your advisor may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funding options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also value the ability to sign a notarial power to manage your finances.
You'll have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your father or mother has a medical emergency and he's on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down that information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who care about it?" asked Martin.
"What are you taking?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Set a plan."
A man receives several shots with a compressed air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after nightfall.
The victim, aged 40, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in his chest, abdomen, and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place about 2:30 a.m. (British Summer Time) as a random act.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His wounds are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Because of the court of communications, rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Domanga Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5th earthquake.
In Palu, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
We then provided some key data about Palu and Dongala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Domanga is a region over 300 km from the coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
This region, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main cornerstones of the economy of the province of Central Célebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938 a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Dongala in 1996, leading to the death of nine people.
Indonesia is on the High Seismic Peacebelt Firebelt, so it regularly suffers from earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which took place on December 26, provoked a tsunami that affected 14 countries, leading to the death of 226,000 people on the Indian coast, more than half of it, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees of magnitude struck the south of Xava, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, leading to the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees of magnitude occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees of magnitude affected the Mentawai Islands, situated in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of people and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya Regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died from the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok, which have caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists shot temporarily.
Arrest Sarah Palin's eldest son for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, natural of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested suspected of domestic violence, of preventing a complaint about domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bond, according to KTUU.
He stood before the court on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, of course," when he was asked, he informed the prison.
Palin's dealing with three minor offences of type A, which means he could go to jail up to a year and get a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor offence of type B, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges are filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to denounce the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Tribunal for veterans of war in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of preventing a complaint of domestic violence and of possession of weapons in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
His fiancée accused him of putting a fist on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after linking her child's violent behavior with the post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome she suffered after serving the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia provokes hundreds of deaths
There are at least 384 deaths after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not available, and the dead balance is expected to increase with the passing of days.
The earthquake took place right in front of Central Celebes, north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Iacarta.
Videos are circulated by the partner networks where the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply a few times death penalty to the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway Avenue, following the lives of the pawns and cyclists he found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to demonstrate that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and caused them serious "intensely" injuries, according to the notification of the intention of a death penalty claim filed in the South New York District.
Both of these offences imply the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with a group of organized crime, practice commonly used by prosecutors of organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "remarkable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors declared in describing the way Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as indicated in the notice of intent to charge.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For a decade, the South York District has not tried a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being sentenced by conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of repentance during the days and months after the attack on court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, as the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos that he viewed on his phone according to the charge.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He declared himself not guilty of the indictment of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal agents responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of accepting a life-threatening guilt statement without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A tory MP claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize a "people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Ordinary Member Peter Bone stated in the Birmingham event that the United Kingdom "would have already left the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile the divided ranks of her party was evidenced by joining the Tories in favour of staying in the EU for an independent protest against Brexit in the city.
The first minister is fighting to maintain the commitments of his Czech plan between the attacks of the supporters of Brexit, the opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he kept fighting to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone said in the concentration of the Leave Means Leave of Solihull movement that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been contacted to assume responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If I had given you the job, we would already be outside the EU at the moment," he said.
The Member of Parliament of Wellingborough added the following: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Czechs' plan.
Showing its opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Mr Bone denied the suggestions that indicate that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely false".
The members of the tories and supporters of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also went to the march, since she told the reporters: "The only thing I'm saying is: First Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity among public opinion, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Checklist and start listening.’
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage stated in the concentration that it is necessary to make 'feeling uncomfortable' to politicians if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Today this is a topic of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and here we're meeting today to tell them that we won't let them go with theirs."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit's decision, to be uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become a proud, independent, and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU made a march through Birmingham before celebrating a two-hour concentration in the centre of the city.
A few activists waved banners with Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit) message after the group's release this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
The concept of good Brexit doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or present himself for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he'd seriously consider his candidacy after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a municipal session in a town in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critique of President Donald Trump, will be presenting to the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It focuses on speculations that put it as Trump's successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the Town Hall format since Trump took the presidency.
An assistant asked if she was planning to introduce the president.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that we need a woman in the presidency."
Arrest related to the death shooting of Sims, the LSU player
Baton Rouge Police, The Angels, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested by the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced Dyteon Simpson's 20-year-old detention in a press conference held at 11:00 (Eastern Time).
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who was going out on the images.
Yes, 20 years old, he was shot near the Southern University campus in the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and finally died as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde interfered to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody in the police department of East Baton Rouge Parish.
Sims, a 2-metre-old who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 headlines last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 bounces per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton reaches world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas ranked ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, who left the pole, had a good way out and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into boxing first and let Hamilton run traffic on the back of the group, which would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxing a little later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after several wheeled maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to become reluctantly free from the inside to be at risk of being late after a double defensive maneuver in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and went up to the seventh square at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he led the race for a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tyres to get faster at the end and forward Kimi Raikkonen to fourth position.
He finally got into boxing on the round 44 but couldn't forward any position on the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen on the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all week long and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares," Hamilton said.
An Inadequate Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an event celebrated on Saturday by his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate proved that people were "mersible, repugnant and liar".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate last days, when you see the indignation, when you see that people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and filtrations and they say, "Oh, I wasn't.
I didn't go."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you done any filtration?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't go.
Wait a minute.
Did we filter it?...No.” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the accusations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration had come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," said Feinstein to the committee as the second reported the newspaper The Hill.
"He asked me to keep his confidence and did what he asked me to do."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during the Saturday night act: "I tell you that body language was not the right one.
I may not have filtered it, but I used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using accusations for their own ends.
‘They are determined to recover power by any means necessary.
They are evil and disgusting, they don't care who they hurt, those who have to run to recover power and control," said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars noticed the defeat suffered on Friday in Elite League against Belfast Giants winning the game back for 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an early advantage through two Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied to the local set before Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to climb up to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was about the fourth season meeting between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous victories for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal was made at 3:35 p.m. thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In a heated initial period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to score the goal of the draw no 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants advance in the marker before the first break when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard rematched the match with a goal using power play in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined each other to help Nielsen advance the Dundee for the first time in the party at the end of the second period and secured the victory by the fifth goal of his team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home in Milton Keynes their next party, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered a hero after he died to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The balance of dead people is 800, and there are many disappeared after a large earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and there are many people trapped under the waterfalls of the city of Palu.
Although his fellow workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Grande refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport control tower in Palu.
He stayed at his post to make sure that the 6321 flight from Batik Air, which was on the exit track at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to come down.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision may have allowed hundreds of lives to be saved, reported the ABC News channel in Australia.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
‘Set your heart to us while you hear us,’ he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death balance may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The victim's balance is believed to continue to increase because there are many bodies under the falls and many of them could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the de minimis."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia has suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now claims there's a missing one after an airplane accident in a lagoon
The airline that operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there's a missing one after stating beforehand that the 47 passengers and crew left the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that she was working together with the authorities, hospitals and local researchers to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships in the area helped rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were continuing in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the pond before reaching the landing strip.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed the landing strip from a long distance.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he came in with very little height.
"That's something extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers were able to advance through the water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a slight wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy indicated that some sailors who were working close to the site on the task of improving a dock also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to carry people to the shore before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to data from Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none affected Air Niugini.
An analyst makes up the night's chronology on which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution proceeded to the test on Saturday in the repetition of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recompose the 29-year-old defendant's moves, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones demonstrating that Tellis was meeting with Chambers the night of his death contradicting his previous claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When this data showed that his mobile phone was meeting with Chambers for the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford climbed to the stage on Saturday and testified that day he was not in the city that day.
When the D.A. asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he declared that he was on the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction consisted of Tellis claiming he had known Chambers for about two weeks after he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers died, Tellis removed the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
"The draft of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be brought to trial by the jury on that very day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A three hip hop wants to challenge the negative perception that genre has by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that hip hop has turned away from its origins with political messages and fighting social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get the fighting hip hop back to be popular.
Artists such as The Runges and Common recently experienced a regurgitation in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York child caretaker demands a couple after a "racist" message
A New York childcareer is going to sue a discriminating lay-off couple after receiving a message that would not be addressed to her from the mother in whom she complained that she was "another black."
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her distress when she found out that the caretaker of children Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOON, OTHER NEGRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nanny who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was waiting for a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs Maurice paid for her work day and she was sent home to a Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple for a redundancies compensation and requires a compensation of $350 per day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even if there was no contract by means.
"Look, I want to show you that these things don't happen," he told the Post on Friday, to add later, "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusations of racism claiming that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife had sent him a message that I didn't intend to send him.
He's not racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person to whom they offended, though it had been due to a mistake?
Your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a very difficult situation.
"Will you go for such a person?
That's not very ethical," added the investment banker.
As the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers had not identified themselves with a talking bear as you can conclude in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented the following about the letter: "It's hard to put on the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's really fun to know what we know about Paddington's huge success now."
After claiming that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of his work being refused, he added that the 60th anniversary of the book publishing was "agrid" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to which he describes as "a very important member of our family," he added that his father was quietly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you're proud even if you didn't really do it yourself.
I think I felt the success of Paddington a little like that.
Even though it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye through the phone.
After the landing, his daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save his life.
"Nad regularly called to say that he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I received the call from Nad to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
He had died a while before and now he was turning it off.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapered, at that moment of mourning for her daughter's loss, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without noticing the skull she was suffering.
"No one has detected it," he said.
"He had his head down and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this awesome feeling of solidarity by Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Postcards of afflicted women to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are wearing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to which you can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any fathers to feel the way I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said their smile lit up every room."
Nevertheless, he left work before he died and was "in a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis commented, "I'm still concerned about a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people to come to and talk to, even if she's a friend.
Don't be quiet, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
"You haven't told me you were sad or depressed or nothing like that," he remarked.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day played deep (when the children opened their gifts, he made no visual contact with them or anything)".
He said that his death caused a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He threw away the family.
He pulled us out.
But we have to go ahead and fight."
If you're going to be able to go ahead, you can call Samaritans for free by number 116 123 (in the United Kingdom and Ireland) send an email to the address jo@samaritans.org or visit the Samaritan website here.
Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs a thread while the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something like what I was asking for (a limited and limited-term investigation), we might be able to achieve some unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that I feared the committee would be "drinking" because of the paralyzing of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to do the investigation?
Its reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
There are five weeks left for the half-legislation elections (November 6). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to which he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently occupies 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea is low under Kim's mandate
North Korea's number of deserters destined for South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, said 1,127 desertions occurred last year, far from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the hardening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people in charge of crossing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of the deserters in the North finally offered South Korea citizenship.
Seoul declares that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the largest border truce with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often returns them legally.
The relationship between the North and the South (which technically continues to be at war) has improved significantly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This occurred after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, where they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress ever since.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't trust our national security and, under those circumstances, there's no possibility of any unilateral disarmament first," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and asserts that it is inappropriate to access the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and assured him that he was not suitable for his nature to access the Supreme Court.
He therefore made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever behaved that way, they would call it hysterical," Pelosi declared on his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost screaming and remaining talking as he described his family and his years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the committee, cataloging the accusations against him as a "murder of the grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angry at the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
He said he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
So he objected when asked whether he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed at the post and if Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court you're currently in," Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
He added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the law of protection to the patient and care for accessible health or the Roe v. Wade case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to access the court and still on top wait for us to say, look how good!" said Pelosi.
And women need to practice.
It's a justified dictatorship, months and years of rage overflowing, and you can't expel it without crying.
"We congratulated when we got angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"Don't think it's so weird, do you?"
He went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that consisted of that, when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then it went on.
It seemed brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my most sharp memories in one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, in which I began to cry with an impossible rage to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from the back of the neck, a distant superior who had always caused me a slight fear, and drove me to the back of the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an off-marital adventure on a ship named Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," I remarked among laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Whites and seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in the collection of funds, so he swore he wouldn't run for the presidency unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found out that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only contribute $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" she asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (gratitude for the people who supported him, for frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates and angry with existing sexism) who remained speechless.
"You would think that I had suffered a nervous crisis," reminded Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"Did you dig?"
In what ways can the trade war between the United States and China be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of trade war between the United States and China were disturbing and, despite the fact that the war is far from over, a distance between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of this year by recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200 billion, recording half of the articles coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has repeatedly countered, the most recent rising rates from five to ten percent by 60 billion dollars in American products.
China has promised to imitate American measures and it seems unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will change in the short term.
To get Washington back, it would be necessary to yield to its demands, but publicly bending to the United States would be much more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts claim that if Beijing knows how to play his cards correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could favour China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions needed to start an economic crisis in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research center in Asia at the Center for New American Security, a center of studies.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is requesting help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the necessary conditions are now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help he can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the US team for a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
The American star Phil Miccelson, who was the most battle he offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the 16 par 3 hole, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer gleamed in all his series, becoming one of the only four players who got a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was implemented in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's first ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against English, Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups fought, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with more tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
"I don't often cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for picking me up and believing me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the drink back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm glad I could have helped," said an excited García after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who was able to defeat the American legend of Tiger Woods golf for 2&1 in the individual Sunday party.
"It's amazing how proud I feel today that I could have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that boy play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, 14 major winner, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble all weekend so they wouldn't get out of the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a golf course of high caliber throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning they faced difficulties with the Europeans.
We fought.
I take my hat off before Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll go ahead.
I want these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
It's to remove the hat.
They were superior."
