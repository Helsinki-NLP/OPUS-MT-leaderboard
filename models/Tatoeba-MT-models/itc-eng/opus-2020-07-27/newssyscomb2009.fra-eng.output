Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
The preliminary results indicate that the anticipated parliamentary elections in Austria have led to a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current great coalition, as well as a well-known strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffers from particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, prepares a triumphal return on the political stage at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent lost almost nine percent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; in particular for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Again in early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
However, the voters were visibly punished for letting the government collapse.
From the initial reactions to the results, speculations regarding the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-canister Wilhelm Molterer were pronounced.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday, at the party's special management council.
Such a development would facilitate a priori the path to the outcome of the election that remains most likely, namely the renewal of the great SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two populist parties on the right - the free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repetition in 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time the FPS was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated itself) on a common government, which even brought sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he planned to return to Vienna, on the national political stage, apparently on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament is the Greens, but the Greens have lost slightly and have benefited, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in fifth position.
Of course, no other party reaches the limit of four percent and does not have access to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India are likely to cool down
If the problem concerning the Czech researchers accused in India of illegal collection of cockroaches could not be resolved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister said this today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mr. Mukherjee said, in leaving the talks, that executive power could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, Darjeling, with the case under its jurisdiction.
"It's a problem that could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could therefore apply for bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner also expresses himself in the same sense during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he may be gratified," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support," the Indian Minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them from India.
"We wish above all to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers to be a great scorn," he said.
The minister avoids the question if he has obtained from India the promise to deal with the matter.
"I have already received a fairly large number of promises," he only observes.
A Czech Arbitrary the Battle for the Seabed
It is approaching an electronic wall map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
He is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area is however as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His leader, the division's director, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, followed the presentation and completion from time to time.
Adoration at work and enthusiasm characterize the reigning atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known so far, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms currently unknown, which can contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A larger fund than a firm land
The coastal states have now begun to aspire vehemently to the new underwater territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they used their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is known as the continental Shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
According to the Convention, the latter may claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental Shelf.
"To simplify, it is considered as continental shelf the part of the seabed and its basement, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred thousands of marines that represent the so-called exclusive economic one," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country in question submit to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of continental Shelf should be supported by broad scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous prospections and costly metrosis.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has been working on five applications, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries mentioned have been successful at the moment," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, which is the first to have considerably expanded its underwater possessions, has recently experienced a global decline.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which was allocated to it last week, is 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in prospections.
The benefit they will gain in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project, be invaluable.
Other countries will, in turn, progressively submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years after ratifying the "Convention of Montego Bay".
Here, where the continental shelf ends, begins the zone of the oceanic background, proclaimed by the convention "common patrimony of humanity".
There, no state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is attributed by an international institution established by convention.
"However, let's not cheat on it, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka, stating that "these areas are clearly defined and their regime is anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of the Eastern countries within the framework of the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it obtained under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other States, the status of the so-called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area expected by the investor is slightly higher than the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is enlivened there, it is a sort of submarine replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract it over a range with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic productions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," he named Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian division employee, provides an example of such a realization.
She recalls a small potato, or, with some imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German special forces were on the scene for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but never turned to action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists removed from Egypt are revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, as well as federal army and GSG 9 officials, the federal police and the federal criminal police officers, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk, were at the scene of liberation.
As the Ministry spokesperson reported on Monday evening, the German forces were not finally required, hostage-takers who freed their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian Government would have accepted Germany's assistance to integrate it as a support force on-site.
"I'm glad that didn't happen so far," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of the Federal Interior.
The aggressors had kidnapped the group of tourists in southern Egypt consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their removal into the desert south of Egypt, hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostage takers has remained vague until now, as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have meanwhile arrived healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the hostages released were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of liberation.
In Berlin for the time being, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and the special forces should have taken off on board an Airbus of the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives refuses the rescue plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has recently failed the plan to rescue heavy financial markets of $700 billion.
The Dow Jones grunted in the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the United States House rejected the rescue plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all calls from the President of the United States George W. Bush and political men at the head of the two parties, the program that had to play the chaos of the financial markets did not obtain the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the supporters desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-founded 700 billion dollars of this heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debate, had called on Members to vote in favour, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones went down more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan might have.
It goes back a little before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, it falls again.
Experts are now planning new serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, approval and approval of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate are necessary.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
With regard to bookings for the next few months according to one study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, German travel thirst remains unsatisfied according to this study.
With regard to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, as was entrusted on Monday in Berlin by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to the GfK Market Research Institute's survey, increasing numbers of bookings are already dominated by autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have climbed to about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DVR was entrusted.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyses the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations from the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Because of the low dollar rate, travel to the USA would be particularly requested, the DVR said.
There, the increase in bookings would rise to about one Third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our territory would be particularly sought by the Germans.
The organized travels are particularly requested, explained DrV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organised trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with reductions in advance bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very much retained so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has fallen compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
Ballermann's or Pres-Ski's hits are continuous, beer in beers and celebrities in Tyrolian costumes to design.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we don't actually have much in common.
She is blond, TV entertainer and wears a custom-made tyrolian costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is an opportunity.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and that on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we become friends.
The cheap Tyrolian costume seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist of the beer party and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on Square Thérèse, everything is half worse.
Each or almost wearing a tyrolian costume or leather pants; no one looks blasphemous or affected by shame - it's completely normal.
Only the board of my Tyrolian costume collects a few weird shots of eyes at the rocky banana stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out that I would have badly tied my board: "On the left means free, in the virgin middle, on the right-hand side, on the widow's back."
Discreetly, I trip my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she tells me and she's ridiculous.
Others do not give themselves as much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drop to get dressed!" and exposes us their naked rear-train without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first at the beer party.
He finds that "gorgeous" with a deep ooooo.
He tells me all about it after he's relieved of the chop he's been drinking before.
Directly next to this burning mouth that everyone thinks he's a trash can.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild pissers."
Others don't have the chance to get rid of alcohol that way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, rescuer reels run on the party square and must take care of the poor drinkers.
Rather, nurses intervene in a pack - always by four, they drag their tent-covered sawmills.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the circle of the boroughs under the board are not visible.
"Those who can no longer swallow," cried one of the rescuers in answer to my question and then disappeared into the mixture.
Accident victim identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Shenfield Road from Friday to noon in the city.
She was transported to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then died there.
As a result of the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested as suspected of dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey planned to join the European Union, the European Powers were eager to enter its back country.
On the east side of the Bosphore, 20 steps away from Asia is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is set on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, with observation towers at each of its angles, such as some German provincial mayorates.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is ruined.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retardator of the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and has the land most known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its Arab irregularities.
The isolation of its surrounding region, created by the ice borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the German Turks and their allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a munitions train exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it has fallen slowly in ruins, swallowed up in the middle of history.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolie and all the Eastern points serves at least symbolicly, to highlight the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The isolation of its surrounding region, created by the ice borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a car-bed towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP AKP Turkish Suat Kinikioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 and a half hours, rocked on noisy rails whose cadence recalled the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning back to his German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspects the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra modern structure, specifically built in stone and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and numerous pastries in which middle managers in costume-cravate-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kinikioglu could have been a right-centre politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its backland.
Now she must look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"But, here's that at some point, "I asked if" Turkey should not choose?"
"Turkey" said, "doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out one aspect that almost all those with whom I could talk to, have said to me by heart: The Turkish railway not only goes towards the Middle East, but also towards the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, is therefore both an advantage for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe travelling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydropasha Station, after another night without sleep, I found out to these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that European ambitions in the Middle East could, in large part, be in Turkey's hands.
While waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the time when Turkey had been called "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11th) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already starting from his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir was to include those under 21 years, but before Proteus could not sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old - refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music was presented to him, whether he was madrigal or messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and that thanks to the inspiration of one man, and to his enthusiasm for music, which remains constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod told us to "let music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there in music.
So sing!"
Its baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it a lot higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be appointed a knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982 when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me and, sometimes, they have even inspired me
Tod Handley had so rare this combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focused only on certain people".
Many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your Necrology of William Woodruff (died September 25th) states that "in 1946, he resumed his studies in economic history, in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was making a BSc, a MA and a PhD."
Here's what comes from Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time finished a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at universities in Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to conceal this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "the Flamenco and life" because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted me to their simplicity and strength and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys many feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda's super sales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolum has an even wider interior space.
In addition to this, some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
A evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation was placed on the market.
First of all, it is noted that Honda has renovated this model within a shorter period than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales on other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Specifically in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with about a million cars sold in six years, is located in the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow her to increase her sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it planned to sell 100,000, which would represent 17% sales growth in the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002 which accounts for 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish branch is looking forward to selling 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to make much of the drop in sales in Spain.
In fact, those in charge of the trade mark expect to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars in less than in 2007, is a 16% drop in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese trade mark also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Nipponne company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change by 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a gas reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double-fund system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity plus the first-generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Jazz 1.2L Honda box is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors that provide access to the rear seats have an 80-degree opening angle, which is related to the rear doors of the first Jazz that would open with a 67-degree angle.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1,2 and 1,4 liter petrol propellers.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2 liter engine develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tr/min and 114 Nm of torque at 4.900 tr/min.
This propeller - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters to 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which over the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaching 100 horses.
This 100-horse Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters to 100 km and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan inspired himself, this time, of nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by mimicking the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
It's called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have made this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Trademark Management, BR23C represents the development of the Nissan security shield.
This robot will allow brand vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that looks very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But most important are the eyes composed of the bee, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects the obstacles that are located on a distance of two metres and in a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"At the time he detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurking his 90-degree wheels or more to avoid collision.
The greatest difference in relation to any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is completely instinctive.
If this was the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, " explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Displacement Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
" Every second this device must only process information and act according to these data.
It does not need to keep information or intuitive logic of prior maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
It may surprise us, but we're not talking about mega-bytes of memory, or even megabytes."
This represents the first reason for the development of new collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into the serial cars within ten years after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding road barriers.
They're afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not without genius.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they have created a game to learn not to fail: ' Bad Credit Hotel'.
It means 'the Hotel of Bad Credits' ... or stories.
The dismal aspect of this accommodation and especially the Master of Hotel leads us to think on several occasions if this is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is sure that this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It's more of a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry to his round table at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will pay $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a new one hosted by a strong decline in its scholarship course.
One week after an interim agreement was revealed, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of regular Morgan Stanley shares at a unit price of $25.25, or a total of $3 billion.
The price retained is less than 19% at the accounting value of securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a 10 per cent return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the overall transaction would take place on the basis of an average unit price of 29 dollars, 28% above its current course.
Morgan Stanley's action, however, lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 5:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," explained John Mack, the director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities, but does so under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had just announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares in Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, he explained to Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the Executive Director of MUFG, "we thought that participation would consist entirely of regular actions.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their accounting value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert its preferential securities into regular shares in one year if more than 50% are exchanged over the conversion price, or approximately $47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG's capital will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a spokesperson of the group refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should display a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he has been "cleanly" relieved his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tested for the group, which has seen its stock exchange course melt by half while the cost of insurance against a risk of default on its debt has flown.
This cost declined on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's large investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's buy-out, announced that they had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
To consolidate the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it was the third that put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, based on official results of 80% of votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a large victory of the "yes", located between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night in Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way," he assured Ecuadorians at Guayaquil governorate headquarters, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in calm according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution devotes the State's power to the economy, by reserving to it the "planning of development" of a country that lives mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currencies that send its emigrants.
Elected in 2006 by Correa, the project also gives strengthened powers to the Head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and fight for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the 11 tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday, healthy and safe in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commander in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived around 330 hours on board a special aircraft at the military base of al-Maza, docked at the international airport of Cairo.
They were immediately transferred, unable to speak to the press, on board helicopters to Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the bullies," said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanta on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been hopped from one cache to the other by 35 unknown bulldozers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian agency, Safari organizer.
An Egyptian security officer reported that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack on the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of shots took place, and half of the bulldozers were killed, the others running away," said the manager who demanded the anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the lightning unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commanders.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of our men in secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The previous day, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the raiders were on, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and stopping two.
The army had stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United Liberation Movement, which this movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place in the headlines and is currently being held in the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the misery that can be attributed to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or to national historical places that create hunger?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government devote three and a half million euros to the restoration of Chinon's only castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with three monies of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten graveyards.
When is a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalize Part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states assist the Belgian-Dutch bank as the first European banking institution in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, partially nationalizing it. The three countries support this financial institution with an amount of EUR 11.2 billion, which also has interest in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also calling on the European Central Bank and the competition officer of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the international financial crisis that has been going on for more than a year is for the Fortis bank. In a certain sense, the decisions that will be taken in the case of that bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy almost half (at 49%) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell some of its shares, among which, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year of the Dutch ABN Amro organization.
Last week, the Fortis actions started a vertiginous fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let her go to bankruptcy.
Only Friday, the company's actions fell by 12 percent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, more than two-thirds of their value has fallen.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to society's leaders, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty of the overseas Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan, of being the cause of the fall of the Fortis actions.
On Monday, the papers have already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank as the new Director General.
The financial agency also sought private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they were not going to lose their money.
No panic was felt in the banking client circle and no agency was assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Experts on information protection fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of information on the prescription of medicinal products, in any case, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in the hands of independent hands, otherwise it's about entrusting his chicken to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the programme creator used to manage drug requirements in Washington Post.
Insurance companies are dependent on insurance premiums and insured capital in the event of damage, on the health status of the client who is present, and if they feel that the risk is too high, they do not even assume it.
In the past, they sent the candidates to a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after having learned of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, he provides easily with pharmacies, data on the purchase of drugs of the person in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines himself, which disease the person suffers and what state of health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high rate of fat in the blood, which immediately puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk factor, so there is no longer much to do to the insurer except the paperwork. However, minor problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program are the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, certain mixtures may be used against migraine or hot boils, but may also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of the data, and they must request permission from the patient before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
They are now forced by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their past failings.
In recent years, some companies have also dealt with laboratory analysis results, and have linked them to data on drug use. In this way, they are able to provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and monitoring of use becomes increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the control circle of the authorities concerning companies specialized in the provision of data is currently before the Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his programme, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
This is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her agreement, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance agreement with him or her.
So, finally, chickens depend on the beauties of the fox.
The global menu of Marseilles
The European Union and India are expanding their trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit next to other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a summit in France-India where there will be a major issue of cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a major emerging democratic power to which a wider right should be given in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They were not too slow on this question yesterday at this 9th summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they were going to multiply by two trades, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be too ambitious.
In this regard, they have harmonized from a legal point of view the 26 bilateral conventions with India concerning civilian flights, and in this way air exchanges can also increase in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with one side, India, which is the first trading partner in the EU, and New Delhi, which is only ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and there was an urgent need for a United Nations conference on this subject.
The conclusion of the Doha business cycle was also requested, although both had a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed its loyalty to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as the fact that a global market should be passed at the scheduled climate conference next year, and the emission of greenhouse gases by 50 per cent up to 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state today goes to the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he prepares to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the press agency's information, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, over three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square metres of the Salon with more than 403 thousand exhibit titles, and Turkey as an honored guest.
This will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: indeed, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy- 264 square metres of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the meeting with the press in the Room Struktur, at the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and perspectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books is decreasing progressively compared to the total Italian production, and in particular to that of adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fosset's plane wreckage, the billionaire that disappeared on September 3, 2007 while he was flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3,000 metres high, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, no human remains, however.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, evinced the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is the one on which Steve Fosset was traveling the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains have been found on the plane or around it.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the crash was detected, a team of investigators sent to the premises identified the aircraft: it was Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their home at Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
In the sixth attempt, in 2002, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic ball: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he had flown around the world without a stopover.
Among all these records, also that of having stolen at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the ordinary of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, with wide surfaces and net angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the off-road "compacts" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a fresh wind in this area.
Just by its non-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom, starting on October 17.
Thus the advertising campaign that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic 3D poster campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulate in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan's shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that by looking at the image, the car exits the display.
Then, through the use of the innovative Remove8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes tries to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy has been ashamed of now? They are members of the " Ultras Italy" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and who, up to now, has never created major problems.
He had never had a fight with the opposing typosis.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, they added small groups (a little in reality) of Campania and Puglia.
They had tricolored flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed to avoid being identified.
They're inspired by the English typhoon.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhoon of real Nazis, that of the Levski.
Figc had made available the Italian typosi, 144 tickets for the part: all nominees, and therefore easy to control.
And the Viminal had all of them controlled: none of those who left for Sofia had a Daspo in progress, none of them had been forbidden to attend a stage.
Four Italian typosi who had a history of stadium crime, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will happen from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, the arrested typosis or identified in the messes purifies a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo which prohibits the attendance of Italian but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans won't get any more foot in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now it's time for fear-emotion: that is, others might add to the hundred and fifty firsts.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes wide open especially for the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Puglia there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, on Tuesday, the Cass, which can even count on a section of Asia, that is, secret services, which deal with stage problems.
"The Duce-Duce bones, and the arm held during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
Here is Domenico Mazzilli's opinion (expressed in a truly unfavourable way) recently, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where he resides a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli said, that renting Mussolini is not a crime in Bulgaria, but it is certain that the conduct of these 150-200 typhus has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - add no.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the event occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles to Mameli's anthem: those too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not police..."
