Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American president of history.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will, inter alia, receive them for the exceptional effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected him between 172 and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple has a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth American president who receives it, even though the third one who receives it in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as President of a country currently at war in two countries.
Their war efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of their critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them to charitable purposes, but it has not yet decided to which particular organization.
During its full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which the Prime Minister and the other 250 guests will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings.
Obama had a rather reserved attitude from the beginning to the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police accused the president of the civil association Společnost ochránc. . přírody Litoměřice (Sociedade de Defensores de la nature Litoměřice).
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and in order to withdraw the appeals he demanded investors money for his own benefit, said Litoměřice Alena Romová police spokesman.
The president of the Société de Defensores de la nature Litoměice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently arrested and facing a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate the trash
In Prague, citizens can separate the packagings of drinks and in villages in southern Moravia containers can be found to separate garbage everywhere.
And Brno?
They need several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't separate the trash for nothing.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally late in the separation of waste, not only by the fact that we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to put a bottle of PET in the center to the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is in Moravské square náměstí, opposite the Potrefena Huse.
Don't get mad at me, Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
It should not be mentioned that elsewhere it is not easy to separate waste.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
Undeterred
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw several bottles of glass and plastic into the trash.
But at Calle Kaunicova I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the train I found the right place.
However, the waste is already bulky of the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extract, which shames us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a little, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst in the whole region of Jihomoravský kraj.
"Parubek" budget took money from the incomes and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government's opinion, add funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for incomes, sickness subsidies or for building savings.
But neither for the interests of State debt or international litigation.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they were assured that the government subsequently asked for a loan for sensitive expenses, incomes or sickness subsidies. "That only means deferring problems for the future, it is to put mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher interest and, someday, you have to return the money.
The state does not have many options to make money.
If you do not reduce social subsidies or State operating expenses, you have to increase taxes.
To everyone who added the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later on, so did your children.
People do not have to worry about the income or sickness subsidies, they will receive them. Of these accounts 1,800 million disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; the next year will not be missing in the treasure only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will continue to increase alongside interest costs.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity benefits, as the government did in its deficit package.
Because of the money travels for the benefit of some groups of voters, the next year will also be five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
Above all, these are sectors where tenders have already been concluded and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their prices cannot be reduced.
The most you can do is keep them, which is not free of charge either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Karel Hanzelka Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD proposed a salomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mainly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year of ČEZ allocated to the budget 18 billion.
Every year dividends are paid ecological damage, are used to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit at the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of the money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to grant several compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, including in the saving of construction.
It is unclear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, we may have to pay it, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, take the hand of the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are already needed for the Státní pokladna project (State Fund), which is two billion and has already been launched. It must allow you to monitor in-line what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will arrive, Janota warns.
Your future smart phone can work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With just pressing one key, they spend in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the U.S. VMware company, which focuses mainly on the development of computer virtualizer software.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at once.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and proved for the first time several days ago.
It will be launched in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the N800 Nokia, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work together.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
The VMware company cooperates with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries the hotelers
Not only skiers in Krkonoše worry about snow-free tracks.
The lack of snow makes people not reserve ski rooms in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including nochebuena and nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they ask immediately about our opinion, if these Christmass will be snow or mud," said the maintainer of the Spindl news portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend their night in Špindler, Mlýn, according to their expectations, should no longer hesitate to book their stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
Hotelers from Špindler a.m. Mlýn offer mostly weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they'll keep offering them, but they'll soon yield and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura thought.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what we are most interested in is Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That's why we've already prepared some Christmas rooms of the last moment," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer Christmas in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the snow-free mountain.
If the tracks remain snowy during the week, Christmas dates will be exhausted too," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free spaces.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well," reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the rooms in Nochevieja are already also occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně in Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, as we found about sixty percent of the occupation capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, the interest for stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hotels in Krkonoše will spend the snow waiting.
Thursday must fall temperatures and, if there are precipitation, it should snow on the mountains.
But once again, the temperatures will rise, said Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the foolishest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, expected anxiously, it was shown that it is a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is the words "equal as in Iraq" used several times, but it also also hesitated to use the title of Bush's January 2007 declaration for his own statement: "A new way forward".
He was himself, who criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war three years ago, and that was criticized as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that nothing is spoken of in the news today.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively left his successor a situation far more favourable than it might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
The country captains once again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided gunmen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He requested 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president wavered for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he tricked the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama's whole strategy seems to be its goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finalizing this procedure in three years. Obama's whole doctrine generated more questions than the answers it offered.
Many doubt that the increase yields the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing their boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. The patriarchal tribal relations will remain behind him.
Balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confused relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even to establish a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of the whole operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy shocks for its volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to the war to "go home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is a purely irresponsible one, since the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of U.S. defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly reluctant to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions do not have any effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America starts the triumphal withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for presidential elections and that is why there is still a lot of time left to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Bank leaders Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses again
High executives of the US Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced this to respond to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to join the Wall Street bonuses with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest road to take, mentioned the former investor bank of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced the criticism after it had increased almost $17. billion (almost $3 billion CZK) for bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters agency, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to record at once, with a tax of 50 percent, the bank bonuses that exceed £25,000 (approximately 712.000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories of less physical
Five women, which is a record figure, received today in Stockholm by King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes of this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among the winners.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine by two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in chemistry received from Israeli Ada Jonath and the American Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last prize given, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a awarded woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel Prize medal and the certificate of the money received.
This amount in each category is up to 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In the event of several awards in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most expected Nobel, the Peaceist, received him today in the afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy that he had been awarded, since he was at the beginning of his career and was also at the head of a country that was involved in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if its price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the State budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also the Janota residence in the cabinet, are supposed to be the themes of your Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
On the appointment, the spokesman of President Radim Ochvat reported.
About his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, adopted on Wednesday the proposals from the left for the transfer of funds and increased the money for the salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, since undercover they increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Because of this conflict, the future activities of the bureaucratic cabinet of Fischer began to be controversial, the form of which was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, actually liquidates the savings package, imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long been neglecting "the serious problem," that is, "the non-sustainable deficit" of the public estate.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a wider consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is frightening and that the government should think of its future existence.
ODS vice president Petr Nečas said for ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words of "strong sentences".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is amazing, prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government. It will surpass the 200,000 million crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said the adoption of the state budget for next year was successful.
People were also happy.
Mandela in the new film by Clint Eastwood, played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Invincible, reports a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
History speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and his first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American actor winning an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 91-year-old Mandela asked him to play in Eastwood's movie.
Another important role is Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
Seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the prize for his role in Eastwood's drama on the world of boxing Millions Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up a slave, of the fictitious president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the South African rugby team captain Francois Pinear, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after the apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and therefore he decides to join rugby players, who belong globally to outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the cinemas.
I had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as much as possible to reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried meeting Mandela, dining with him, being behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to hold Mandela's hand.
I found out that when I grabbed her hand, I received her energy, it was transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pinear, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players dominated.
The actor said he had had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A great surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his house.
I remember calling at the door, he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "I look a lot higher in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences between the actors and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talks about ambitions for Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on the Rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The Splendor's Secret on Norway Sold: The Russians Tested a Missile · Global Voices
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence finally acknowledged yesterday that near the borders with Norway he tested a ballistic intercontinental missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, like "Bulava", previously destined to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or a failure occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulavá" as "a missile that doesn't fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again on the aircraft.
The engine probably crashed at the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated into the White Sea.
This type of missile enables the launch from a boat that is moving and submerged at once.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulavá".
The Norwegians have not hesitated from the very first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by claiming that we cannot simply talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the accident occurred in the third.
In previous cases the engines were discovered immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the throws went through completely without errors, the Ministry of Defence's management of only six out of 13 failed.
The success of almost 50 percent full of optimism to the generals and therefore continue to claim that "Bulavá" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, the maximum total weight of which is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with Moscow's CSKA at age 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will re-present himself at 51 years of age for a professional hockey meeting.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help your Moscow CSKA team and possibly play Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his career at the age of forty years in 1998 and is currently chairing CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash gets hurt, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and is committed to helping the team.
We just need to solve some formal issues, he quoted AP agency Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, it will become the longest professional player of Russian hockey.
The legendary front Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one years, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 attendances.
The largest of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won at the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career he also won in the NHL: playing with Detroit twice won the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Glory Chamber.
Hyundai met union requirements. He will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the unions declared on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman of the Hyundai Motor Vehicle Factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, because it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will work in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on Saturday's shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for extra hours or can take a day off on December 28, i.e. prolonging Christmas parties in one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive money for travel and food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon decided immediately to cancel all the extra work for the month of December, Vaněk mentioned.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work two hours more than eight hours and this situation lasted practically every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the management of the factory and trade unionists must take place on Monday morning.
The head of the Petr Kuchař unions said on Wednesday, that if they are committed to meeting the requirements and signing the document, they are prepared to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation in the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went into strike for frequent additional work.
They also protested against bad payment conditions and the alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the emergency on Monday strike also demanded that none of the employees, last Wednesday, interrupt the manufacture, be penalized in any way.
With regard to additional work, trade unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The serial manufacture was started last November.
Until last September it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech Discovery: An Effective Substance Up to the 'Employed' HIV Viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds able to moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some accessible medicines already.
AIDS cannot be cured so far.
However, patients' lives may be significantly prolonged by a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus into the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs will no longer work.
The work of the experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalcarbons have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalcarbons are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently from all the medicines used today, and that is why they can solve the resistance problem.
In their work scientists find new, ‘better’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
Metalcarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are united by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an HIV albumin, and it is essential for the vital cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no fractionation of the HIV virus and there would be no mature and infectious form of the virus.
If we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, they explain scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which remains systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
Test of the effect of this series of HIV protease substances was tested, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalcarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on the clinically used medicines, however they do not lose their effect on the resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes it interesting for metalocarbons to be composed for research in order to propose effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína 'ezáčová, the head of the structural biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics in the Academy of Sciences.
Budget fight. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "surprising" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, he said, think of its future existence.
ODS statements were pointed out by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say it's time for analysis.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas said the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the House of Deputies wants to support the minority, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the public deficit problem is completely different, Nečas warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the 2010 budget, however, with the modifications on the left side, for over 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for salaries of state officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government rejected the proposals of the ODS, as the budget deficit is being covered.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the desire of the government, which the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and feeling of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of the adoption of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká television Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out, that he's thinking about staying in the function.
The reason for this is their disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government they have nothing to do with those nominated by the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, if the chamber adopts other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to sickness, income grants, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not to blame
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers nominated by the ODS have done nothing wrong, said Topolánek on the U.S. text news.
He recalled, that in several ministries in the lieutenant posts there are people who belong to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public holding, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is supported by the left majority, who is currently in the Chamber of Deputies."
However, the support and tolerance of SDG members cannot be achieved.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will take care of it, told the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of the ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer attended a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS yielded at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas pointed out that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the modified budget if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
At the resignation of the mandate, I knew that in the following months it was mainly about the Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of all positive things, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new schedule of ČD trains will circulate less trains by almost the same rates
České Dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will, for example, win the residents of the Ostravsko region, Dráhy for this line will add a pendulum road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not be recirculating in Bratislava.
On the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate fewer fast trains, direct links on Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by Drahy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor route - České Budějovice and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek line - České Budějovice line will be reduced only to a few days of week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15. line of the Esko system, around the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the Lysá nad Labem line to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From 13 December the travellers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The regional railway account this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive in the coming year four billion crowns in total, just like this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, the next year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local Dráhy trains they have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always a year.
Drahy are happy with the system, and maybe that's why they didn't raise the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will occur only on one-day tickets - ČD Net and on cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine armed forces continue to arrest more than 50 people, children were released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several pupils from a primary school and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 abducted people.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that approximately 19 armed soldiers use hostages as a living shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously persecuted the kidnappers due to violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in Maguindanao province was due to the recent killing, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre, related to the governor's elections, 30 journalists were.
Because of suspicion of the involvement in the killing, the governor of this province was arrested in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, on Tuesday they renewed the peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA's story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech esInvictus: Neporažený) was released in American cinemas, which captures part of the biography of the former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-known player against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the role protagonist Mandela himself.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was interpreted by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rohlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mveso, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the world football championship culminated in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media are horrified by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new RSA film have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of leading roles by Hollywood's "little interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman says, however, that he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as it is said - collect her energy, mentioned in an interview after the holiday premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if we can remember Mandela's character and message through the movie.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the costume of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. He portrays South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to join two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts on the national rugby team costume and enters the playing field. RSA won at that time the world cup.
To enter the gramille in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela 14 years ago won great ovations, especially from the white audience and the recognition of white inhabitants.
The football championship may help people join and form a nation, mentioned rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
However, white South Africans are skeptical, as he said in a recent LN interview, a rugby amateur Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko, a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns burns
The fire caught a transformer of the company Čeps in the morning in a switch box near Výškov village in Lounsko.
According to Lukaš Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, however later changed their mind and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokesperson, which did not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly won't be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová, it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of the activity of Čeps did not happen anything similar, such damage is sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the ČEZ company's voice for the North Chechnya, supplies of the electric current were not cut, and the fire of the electrical substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps p'sobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the electric drive of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical power from the transmission system to the distributor system, and maintains the 4339 km long electric drive.
Jančura will file a complaint for slander to three hetmans of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will file a complaint for slandering three Social Democratic Hetmans.
They are Michal Hašek of the region Jihomoravský kraj, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and the hetman of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in twenty minutes on Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the company's effort, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended signing long-term contracts with České drahy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taken pastas of the cake", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say, that we are more expensive than České drahy, which is not true. We know the prices of České drahy, which were fixed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It's because of slander towards the Student Agency society, she said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
He also mentioned having evidence from all regions, and he said that he did not take necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other hetmans who do so as well.
I suppose, that also on this occasion it will be clear, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the issue of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, mentioned Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue after the new year.
He said that the campaign would be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura began the campaign after the regions agreed with Česke Dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the commission of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call a trend.
According to Jančura similar steps are at odds with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a Member of ČSSD, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't leave, we can lose bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of ČSSD, I know, what you are talking about, I will not say his name, said Jančura today for Radiožurnál.
The pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already views that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococcals culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts have already made this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, children born on August 2 of last year will be free of charge for the neumococal vaccine.
The condition is not to have received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before, have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age.
Last year, a fourth of the families voluntarily let their children vaccinate against pneumococcus.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
Without hugging, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on the entire vaccination of children.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of middle otitis, but also severe infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Of the pneumococal infections in our country each year, 28 children not over the age of 10 die according to hospital investigations.
In addition to Chechnya, the neumococal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are views that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
As of January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, head of the Nahlas civic association.
Its association has been propagating pneumococal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, at which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I believe that this is the way that we now have to take, Kalovský mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this moment we do not think so at all, said his spokesman, Mr. Vlastimile.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the pediatric society Odborná společnost praktických dětských lekaě Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, it may be reasoned on the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have initiated vaccination as a volunteer," Cabrnochová says.
Experts expect that over 80 percent of young parents will be able to vaccinate their babies from the next year.
The pneumococal vaccine is a big change too because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members were afraid, however, that insurance companies could "get money out of health insurance."
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40 thousand a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at 20 million US dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while loading 90 pictures on his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used a excavator to burst into the museum, in the region of the Pocono Mountains.
Frazetta father, 81 years old, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan the Barbarus and Tarzán.
The News Agency Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer stated that a family dispute might have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52 years old, declared to the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to move all pictures to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta father refused to have granted such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the budget report, in the face of opposition criticism, companies and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "lost" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism of damaging low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in social security expenditure and a 1% increase in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have regretted that workers with low wages are punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will grow about £3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which claims that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
CLASSIFIED POINTS OF THE REPORT BEFORE THE BUDGET
Social security with an additional 0.5 % increase from April 2011
Economy will be more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50% tax on banker bonds
The 1 point increase in corporate tax for small firms was excluded
Tax reliefs for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5 %
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, a person who wins £30,000 will lose £90 per year and earn £40,000 will lose £ 190, while a person who wins £10,000 per year will win £110.
The ministers said that their objective of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "hard decisions", but they insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall by 5% of the highest wages.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that the tax increases and the cuts in expenditure outlined were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again toward the end of the year.
However, the forecasts of the Labour Party regarding future economic growth, which will influence the amount of borrowing and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably contract by 4.75 % this year, much worse than the decrease of 3.5% forecasted in April, while the demand for loans would be £3 billion above the previously estimated one.
"A wasteful opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the Labour Party's "debt crisis", said that the projection of borrowing applications for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, adding, "incidentally" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have included nothing significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and have wasted it."
"All major announcements will be made after the election, win whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction in the deficit in the short term.
But the Democratic Liberals claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's expenditures, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "rain castles".
BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson said that the moment chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies of the next month of April, mentioned earlier, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to charges of electoral manoeuvres, since the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided the most needed and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish expenditure data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"This is really postponing the pain for later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All major announcements will come after the election, win whoever wins," said Roger Bootle, economic consultant for Deloitte's counters.
"This has been the false pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
The FBI is investigating "American detentions in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid at a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Punjab province.
The FBI said it's investigating whether they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S.A. last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States said that it was also seeking information about men.
Three of them are reported to be from Pakistani descent, one from Egyptian heritage and the other from Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances they are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said that the agency was aware of the arrests and that it was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing," said the spokesman.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said that the house was already on the look of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on arrests, reported Reuters news agency; but said that the U.S. had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International Condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been the same as disabled, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said they had beaten him and burned him with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
The thousands arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad provoked the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Jameni, recognized some accusations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance towards criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the story of Abraham Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the result of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face" according to their words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and he was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the charges of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container along with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the malaise of the government's post-election and response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee's investigations had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the park of the city
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-metre long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
You see it under a beautiful view of the lights of the city tilling.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent," he added.
Awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the afternoon event on Thursday, the snow will be melted.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have requested a ban on the construction of minarets and a widespread warning of the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French don't like veils" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and concerned the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France with what Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these apparently worldly issues, it supports, things of daily life, those that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They can't fully spread this argument.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists whom Mr Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with their Salafi counterparts, supporters of Purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that the Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions to what extent the French political strategists (and the intellectual elite so fiercely defending secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to have more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives "a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most desolate panorama
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it the life that can't survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and the policy of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of courage facing the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the tip of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured as they swam following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoos are still generally one millionth of the area of a wild adult. The climate is rarely adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore was greened by algae growing within areas without the hair of its fur.

Ellis uses stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of species.
Although it is forbidden in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Eskimo Indians on motorcycles use high-power assault rifles to bring down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alun Anderson, an ancient editor of New Scientist, offers a clear, chilling account about Arctic science and a super-colonizing look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It's not a lack of commitment.
The pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries showed for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the cold war submarines drew a map of the ice-colons moving under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted on icebergs are a useful supplement, but hard-pressed individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the flowing system inside the arctic ice, consisting of saltwater chorritus that is compressed while freezing.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice retires, which is believed to occur at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us.
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns on the graves of Arlington
19-year-old Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, initiated the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel each year stopping in different cities along the way, to conduct events dedicated to military and terrorist victims.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed over 16,000 crowns in the graves of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, tombs at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battle Park in New York City and on the memorial site for Flight 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of his husband, a late military career.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Surrounded in warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers went to the oldest tombs of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they did not receive as many visits as the new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful as children played and couples took their hand, while carrying the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tie tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the ice air.
Some read aloud names carved on the stones, while others leaned to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped the tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the Sgto Marine Gunner's grave. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. My son paid for it, he said.
"Many after my death I want someone to remember."
Cuban officials arrested an American government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributes mobile phones and laptops in the country on Saturday, the State Department officials said.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on client projects such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested for almost anything that is considered "dangerous".
All activities called counter-revolutionary, including mild protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Graffiti anti-government and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested on several occasions permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but permission has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor may likely cause tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, who has been seeking a "slow-paced approach" to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to announce the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and codified products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in prison in Cuba is in between for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly neglected.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as free mobile distribution, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Human Rights Watch program, which recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", a reference to Raúl Castro's place as leader of the country, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries began to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials draw a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, demonstrating that they expect the case to help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who use the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Researchers said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after finding out that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah addressed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the commanders of al-Qaeda that men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the north-west, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of an undercover operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the delicateness of the case.
The official said that the men did not change and were even trying to get proper approval to access the camps of al Qaeda, when the Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who they are of trust.
Since the attacks on 11 September 2001, U.S. intelligence has put the top priority of trying to infiltrate people inside Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda analyses with special attention the American recruits aspiring.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, because of their potential to have access to U.S. goals and because of their advertising value.
But Evan Kohmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate action
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center, bolder actions for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little occurred in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city holding banners in English saying "There's no planet B" and one in Spanish saying, "The Earth says "It's enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, even the Danish and photographer model Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, her mother's native country, made me aware of the distressing issues with which the country must deal because of the impacts of the climate changes that are already taking place."
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
The police prevented protesters from getting too close to Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or wearing pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for involvement in climate talks, activists with black masks and black suits placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as called, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not appear to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I was not really aware of the situation."
Then he kept saying in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is great, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of each one to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Test data reveal persistent racial differences
The federal chart of qualifications last week on math performance was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the best-performance systems in the country, the Qualifications Box showed that fourth- and eighth-grade students were rocked at a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Educational Progress Assessment is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of fourth grade white students in the D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
The performance difference actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-Americans of the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, decreasing a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not quite large.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between the fourth grade white and black students in 2003, when the first ENPE was introduced in the District, was 60 points from the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to just 58.
Some District Education Lawyers expressed concern last week, as the advances made by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by paying attention to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
I am not jumping for joy by a difference of two or three points, said the member of the Council of D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth degree of Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee’s style of administration, said the message of the test scores is that the city’s secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly, they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect them.
But what matters is that we are not devoting the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the higher grades of primary and middle school, who did not master the early reading bases in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Every day's mathematics, a mathematics curriculum from Kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and experiences of real life, which was introduced into the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who was believed to be some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of ENPE highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here is a kind of rough dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution to the conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important timeline.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to hold on to the middle class white and black.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can have excellent public education.
Janey, now a school superintendent in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the difference in performance is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
Almost 200 days must come to have the force of change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year in a 185-day year, who considers it to be an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resurgence.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, the facades of brick and the emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Even so, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the registration costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of potential students enthusiasts.
Yes! This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously?, said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low teacher-student ratio of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to go to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born to Hispanic immigrants in the United States who leave high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands of students who have access to the university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one out of five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduated from college, a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze those of higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many parents also have high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with U.S. schools.
But tutoring programmes can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and the skills to help them navigate the system, it turns out that any intervention at any time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We need to consider providing a support network for these children, from the kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the tour of Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides over $300 million per year to local school systems, to implement university training programs, which start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to finish high school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending the university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have moved away since they were placed in only two of the 10 auctioned deposits.
Seven American companies had paid to take part in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who presented an offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of American oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It'll be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military retreats, probably prevented U.S. oil companies from getting more and more at risk in Iraq, which has the third most important crude reserve in the world, the analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and West Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have linked close ties to the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and have provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two main deposits.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman for the Assam Jihad Petroleum Ministry.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the side of its competitors and will comply with its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to present proposals made offers that then were confronted with the barrel grant that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each deposit.
The main planner of al Qaeda has apparently been murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a alleged U.S. missile attack on the Pakistan border with Afghanistan has killed a major Qaeda planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somalí was one of the two Arab men who is thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the Wazistan province of the North, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA within Pakistan's illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car got the impact, said a civil intelligence officer from Pakistan, speaking over the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that suspected local militants rushed to the spot and quickly seized what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner of al-Qaeda, who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He worked to conspire around the world, said a high official, who spoke from the anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. air attacks within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to the superior command of al Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had rapidly ascended to the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat posed to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of al Qaeda or Taliban leader murdered since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led unmanned aircraft attacks has declined from the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a The Long War Journal account, a non-profit website.
The decrease is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, who have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while brutally harassing suspected informants, said the site.
The UN's peak in Kabul about to resign
The United Nations maximum sent to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by accusations of corruption spread in the Afghan presidential election supported by the United Nations.
The exit of Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said it supports the increase, but he is concerned that the United States military withdrawal schedule, which starts in 18 months, encourages other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian personnel, working with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's exit and my arrival.
Ban has begun to seek a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission to Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French man who previously conducted United Nations peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of mass electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said that the accusations of Galbraith, who was fired, "surely damaged the mission, because there was already much scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a high civilian representative to coordinate the United States-led assistance efforts in Afghanistan.
It also promoted the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, which lend themselves to the Afghan mission, claiming that this would increase its confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, claiming that the heavy UN recruitment regulations undermine his ability to capture talents.
This is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, for their failure to engage in talks about their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, targeting a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week war zone trip in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he held, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that, if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less safe with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "believable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and would accept to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve in return for the fuel that was desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for that agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and to make time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have turned away from the tempting agreements, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of committing itself to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that has not been done in terms of additional significant sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set as a deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before reconsidering other options, even proceed with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devacent sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday as "unfounded and baseless accusations," by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said that it has the will to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was going back to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish oil-rich Iraq region, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 towards the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates' words in Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an ageing China, a shift in course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters telling them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby more means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said 31-year-old Wang, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old child.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a single child's policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously reprobate children, malevolent children, affectionately nicknamed "small emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has dropped to 1.8 children per partner, compared to the six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
Population of the United Nations, while the number of residents aged 60 years and more is expected to exploit from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent to 2050. This is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cultivated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and more accounted for nearly 22 percent of registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, has stated that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and mitigate a future labour shortage."
Shanghai is about to be "so old (not so rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A Progressive Relief
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced so far by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-wife ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their position on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are unique children, and in 2007 they reduced many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research at Beijing University, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Nearly in the morning, the posters that ordered families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
She has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the answer has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing Response
While the officials of a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai maintain that they observed a moderate increase in couples' requests for a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
Huinan municipality, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Caolu municipality in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give your first child the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West view the single child policy incorrectly as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months from the first child of the couple.
Yeah, they're stealing from us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants a single child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not accustomed to caring for others and really do not want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained this in a more powerful way.
For parents with two, middle-class careers, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it is about having enough success as to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents struggle during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from the parents, he supported.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic "has to have a resume prepared for the best daycare facilities when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once," Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, manifested.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, which has so far been characterized by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, attracted renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that carry most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, with over 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not talk about how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature increase that political strategies would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, High Representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate officer, Yvo de Bóer, described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent towards 2050.
The European Union also stimulated the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.600 million annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, Friday was presented the same kind of artificial verbal fires that dominated the talks last week.
The United States Special Climate Envoy, Todd Stern, rejected the claims that required mandatory greenhouse gas emission reductions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
Manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a tougher line with China, with respect to what Bush administration officials did only two years ago.
The United States is not going to make an agreement without the major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs He Yafei, stated that the United States' highest climate negotiator lacked "common feeling," or was "very irresponsible" because he said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, the lines of failure have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the main powers are discussing who should cost the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the large emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, supported Ulate, who also works as regional councillor on climate change in Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants said that the talks would ultimately produce a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, prepared a proposal for a 24-page preliminary treaty early on the morning of Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, leading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are now unified and require action by emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks assumed a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues must be resolved before the heads of government conclude a deal.
High-level officials, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister, descended from the planes and raced to the streets of the Bella Center, to meetings at closed doors and press conferences, in order to be able to define the claims that will be arbitrate during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention centre, activists playing the guitar present night performances mocking the countries that they believe are being sold, and preliminary hand proposals are passed by hand rather than by mail), presents a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for the global policy of International Conservation.
The heavy weights are coming.
The first train at 225 kmh from Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to point to a train exit that marks a revolution for trips to Britain.
The first high-speed interurban train in the country will reach 225 km/h, when passing like a beam from Ashford, Kent, to the St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then join Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first interurban service Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become suburban prosperitys, business travel times would be cut and the change of planes and cars to the railway would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as relieve congestion on roads.
In theory, the three major political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds that are needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and the fears of environmental damage, can still curb Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the Midlands of the West will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 metres of a final route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The favored option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch going west from the Peninsulas to Manchester and Scotland, and another heading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said one railway member.
Once finished, the travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stretch, which would not be inaugurated before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, turning the British network into the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to withstand trains of 400 mt long, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate on a London-Birmingham line every hour.
This means that a London terminal would be needed to receive 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the space restrictions of the capital, an existing station is expected to be extended to suit the high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry argue that only the St Pancras International or Euston station offer this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes that the scheme should proceed, but broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is put in place, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first the trains would be forced to leave the fast lines along the existing lanes north of Birmingham, maintaining the travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers face the mortgage by an orange of £75,000 from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesperson of the Conservative Party, collected the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange that he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the deputies lived "of rations", increased his mortgage in £75,000 to build an extension framed in oak in his second house in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to pay the extra interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenses of the members. Last night Mr. Duncan said that the applications "could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, has a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the honorary office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "alrange".
The neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the House of Commons Committee on Standard and Privileges on its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an inquiry into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £27,406 from his property in London to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
The documents circulated this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately £1,400 per month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland's mortgage interest rate did not change at that time, suggesting that the whole increase would finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard mortgage rate of BRE dropped from 7.94 per cent in December 2007, to 4 per cent in March of this year, the type it is now located.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr Duncan was still requesting £1.250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as President of the House's opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that the Members had to survive "rations" after the expense scandal.
"This is basically nationalized, you have to live in rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I spend my money in my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what's appropriate.
And I could ask a lot more, but I don't."
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole with the form of the sterling pound symbol in Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primordial improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: "It's not about deluding and delinquenting or violating the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be any clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advent of the beach Palape of Brighton
Brighton palates have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palates for every December, using villains as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palate from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with filled pastries and put you served for free.
The villas that have been chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a unpaid clergyman of the Chichester diocese and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we expect us as a Church that people come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate exciting ways.
"The idea of the calendar of the Advent of the palapa began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in protest of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded the Danish ice-cream on claim of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the demonstration began in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with adoquines and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police spoke quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to the police, they are particularly members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the event's organizers, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinction," underlining that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night in handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The quite peaceful demonstration came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the seat of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped at approximately 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
A scene was raised to welcome the invited speakers. The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Most protesters arrived by bus and train in the major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present in the same way as some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most of them with celestial chubaskers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the invitation of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" for "justice and for climate".
Today we take the streets to claim compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: there's time, said the benign singer Angélice Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers are drying up, water courses for which you can walk as you have never before been able to do.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unify climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world".
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kick-off to demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans for solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, there were concentrations of hundreds of demonstrators who claimed to take strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Tens of people were concentrated in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhasia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region recognized by Moscow over a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5:00 GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, the participation was 58 per cent hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five race candidates, including the outgoing president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, who disapproved of voting.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "sorry that Abjasia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted in Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with stunning landscapes, on the banks of the Black Sea.
Large paintings show Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate Moscow's support, and particularly the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, answered by raising his vodka vase.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or opposition.
It takes a majority of 50% plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the midst of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, which was quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped at approximately 500 metres from the centre, without trying to enter.
A scene was raised to welcome the invited speakers. The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
A few moments after the demonstration began, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them on the floor.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with an adoquín, and four cars near a house occupied during the incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to the police.
The extremist groups did not get their eyes off them, prevent the police spokesperson, Henrik Jakobsen, while the law enforcement helicopters overflew the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most of them with celestial chubaskers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the invitation of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" for "justice and for climate".
Today we take the streets to claim compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unify climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world".
The Oxfam organization together with the former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kick-off to demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, manifested red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans for solar energy in front of the City Council of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, there were concentrations of hundreds of protesters who claimed to act against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Tens of people were concentrated in Geneva.
The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be transmitted in the Sunday Informative (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" in the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all students at the first baccalaureate will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "too much with hypocrisy" as he said, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "generally, it calls the best students."
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be sub-samples of the C, it goes on to underline: "Neither did I hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged by having eliminated history and geography in the second year of bachelor's degree in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French of ten (69%) disapproved the government's project of eliminating compulsory history-geography teaching in second B. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "not spoken" to eliminate philosophy from the second bachelor's program C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called on a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
At Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will give a proof of admission that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, a proof of admission about their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also practice in real terms during the year of M2, after which they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the practices proposed before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, you added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he is going to propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to delete the school map "before 2012".
At the High Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain convincingly the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, challenge that he accepted on Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street's Normal Superior School.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the conference wheel "Ernest", a day composed of a series of presentations of experts of fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, reported a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something to attract people and convey them eager to know more, explained in the framework of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this call as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants among the experts in their discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he specified.
About global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," she told AFP Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed that the public understands that "the Copenhagen conference is founded on a very serious scientific record".
The videos recorded during these conferences will be online on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: harassment among prison guards, action is envisaged
Prison guard unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year, premiums and overtime parties, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers Force (2nd guard union) asked off duty staff to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to denounce the theft of their possessions.
The prison CGT (3rd union of the profession) calls them to "gather in general assemblies in the various prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", since it means "happiness and unacceptable" the failure to pay in December of the "extra hours, nocturnal premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "convenes general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Office of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
Solicitity to the Directorate of the Prison Administration immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not occur again in the future.
The December payment will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who "always blames the budgetary demands", deplored Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said outraged the interregional FO union of Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott up to new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if they are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatening FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without more personnel, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack staff salaries, it is estimated by the Burdeos Prison CGT.
According to the unions, not all regions are the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected result, said Ufap's general secretary, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I make better gifts than those I receive."
During a special interview that the ABC chain will issue on Sunday night, President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holidays at the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be on the way.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to the extracts of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "No way last year I made you nice gifts," he said, provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before responding humorously pointing to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who gave devotion to Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts from childhood.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball ball that his Kenyan father, who had seldom seen, gave to him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball ball, the president said.
Just a few years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, rather than accommodate them around the house, however, I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was once again intervened in Los Angeles due to important "lesions" derived from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his colleagues, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Wednesday night to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors verified "discal hernia" injuries carried out in Paris on 26 November, he pointed out his press service in that city, indicating that these injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquility saying that the situation was "under control," and reported that a new medical part would communicate within 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday accepted, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "severe and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more confident about his/her status, adds RTL.
The press service, interrogated by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no channel would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park's international clinic due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled a few days ago, was practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a physician well known in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinaï de Los Angeles hospital on Monday for an infection resulting from Delajoux's intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained on Thursday at RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but he assured himself that he was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter."
He called me just before I went to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to do twelve hours of flying after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure him by saying that Johnny Hallyday, "he reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken with Laeticia, the musician's wife, and he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the health problems of the singer multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days to result in a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed having been operated on a "colon cancer" after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as was expected, his long "Zira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overstated. Fanatics and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the musician to move on.
By mid-November, their allies had even to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: first Bousquet title in your favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medallist at the Worlds-2009 long pool, obtained an international title on Thursday in a distance where he feels particularly affectionate, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in a short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, which coveted the record of the world in 50 m free, brand that has in the long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed with 20'''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international premiere.
Bousquet advanced to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to get the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane bathers that start on 1 January will be banned.
These bathers, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, dual world champion in long swimming pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer did not get his mark down in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he was imposed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this career.
I knew this time I wasn't going to be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and accomplish my mission.
Lobintsev will be a hard rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: A sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola was sold at USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to the French writer Emile Zola sold itself on Thursday at $1.5 million, far above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art marcher.
This panel of 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the third century after Christ, and its price was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dionysic scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is a rare piece, since in the world there are only four or five", explained Tuesday to AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold between a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most put up by buyers, no doubt, pointed to the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was a acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bathtub in his particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time before the marine Pétain took power.
For some fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted the departure from Zelaya to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico felt that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory to the fallen president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied the safe conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
The Mexican government's plane that arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to take Zelaya back to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
To grant him a safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resent" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the deposed president refused because he wanted to reach Mexico as the guest head of State in exercise.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign..., they wanted me to resign," Zelaya said on Thursday on Globo radio, in which he has often made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been in the country of Central America for five months.
Here I can stay for ten years, I have my guitar, added by playing some chords the president's deposit, refugee at the Embassy of Brazil of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's embassy submitted us a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because we did not contain asylum requests, declared Wednesday, the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I will not seek asylum for any country, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview at the Telesur chain, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he said.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the depot president, who met around the Brazilian embassy, strongly besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coupist government.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government against international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on 28 June, the day on which he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This choice was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term of office was ended on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, the figures on the U.S. trade balance are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67 per cent; and the Nasdaq, 0.33 per cent.
According to the final figures at the closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Avarage advanced 68.78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and Nasdaq, with a technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.6 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotic, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the medium full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the US trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to $32,9 billion.
On the contrary, analysts expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that they market with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research company Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "was the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year-old bonus to 4.492% against 4.408% on-the-shelf.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of power hide the "Dames de Blanco"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of the Cuban government ambushed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the world day of human rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some 40 "Dames de Blanco", wives or family members of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, a journalist from the AFP was held.
The Yankees die!, "Mercenarias!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raúl!"core with the fist on high the militants of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil-dressed agents who came to "protect them."
On the eve of the day, a similar demonstration was unleashed against the "Dames de Blanco" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero neighborhood of Vedado, a decade of dissidents who were also preparing to manifest themselves on Thursday for the international day of human rights, was arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, reported an AFP journalist.
The agents forced the vehicles to be taken by dissidents who were ambushed by supporters of the government, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances takes only a few hours.
The "Dames de Blanco", awarded with the 2005 Sajarov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "solicited the release of all political prisoners," about 200, according to the dissent, declared one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, carries a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call the opponents of "mercenaries" or "actors" at the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rarely in the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of Thursday of government militants against "counter-revolutionary" people.
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) on Thursday at the hour of greatest influx of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have beaten with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an old man, in the pharmacy or in front of it in No. 85 of the Boulevar Jean-Jaureès, reported police sources and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a manager of the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, interfered and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other injured, with apparently affected vital organs, is at risk.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," reported a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have hurt two more pedestrians: one man thirty years old, and one man forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclarified.
He was armed with two butcher knives that had crossed his back, explained in the place a head of the Alliance union in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several transactors, including young people, tried to control the disposal, according to the testimony obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, Albert explained, waiter of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
By the boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to stop the armed man and were wounded in fists, according to the testimony of the police.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are numerous shops.
Some people came and told me there was a man injured on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, came with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Highs of the Seine Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his interim detention he has not said a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of placing him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were required to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all disturbed by this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again requests that the case be dismissed
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the cause is dismissed against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of "El Pianista", reported to three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second California District serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel declared: I demand that the charges be dismissed at this time, since the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "has been a chilling result".
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who had passed away since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before sentence, which is a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was published in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the prosecutor's own mouth in question, David Wells.
But at the end of September Wells declared "to have lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed the conduct of a trial that would allow him to submit the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The accusation, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, i.e. that there could be no serious assessment of the charges as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was pronounced for "illegal sexual relations" with a child under 13 years of age.
Since then, he has never stepped again in the United States.
The district deputy mayor of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, declared that Roman Polanski "has to be here to appear at the hearing."
With this cause, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a chance to flee? Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "asks a favor to the court, even though he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also highlighted "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He submits that his client no longer supports her being harassed every time the Polanski case resuscitated, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by order of American arrest.
After more than two months after the raids, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, awaiting an eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses its course and slows down by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday's aimless, in a market that is debated between better indicators than those expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Avarage rose 65.67 points up to 10,471,50 points, while the Nasdaq, with technological component, lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management said.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained through the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve market opinion on the robustness of economic reactivation," the analysts from Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November per second consecutive month and higher than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of U.S. consumers recovered visibly in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the pre-estimation of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes slowed down by a further advance of the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months compared to the euro, which "leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of the Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the ten-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year-old bonus to 4.497% against 4.492% on-night.
The election of Miss Mundo again in South Africa
After a month of tour in South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss Mundo's title are in the final line to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world against a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Beltran Pearl of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Deportista or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real revolt.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and lived countless experiences!, said amazed Miss Sierra Leone.
This contest, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast from Midrand, North Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (15 GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, Miss Mundo Ksenia Sukhinova points out in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian girl, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility to discover again "African landscapes that take the breath away".
After a month of galas, essays, press wheels and safaris, candidates for Miss Mundo concentrate on the contest.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
The dream of every woman is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it is not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade with traditional dresses and, of course, with bathrobe.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen, Michelle McLean, and a head of Miss Mundo committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa demonstrated its ability to receive the world with warmth and pride that are difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World Championship.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto’s famous township, but this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Something unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone observes.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been dealing with people I've never thought of getting to know.
Probably coming back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, told the press David Hallyday at the exit of the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13 o'clock locals (21 GMT).
The son of the singer, distended, assured that he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection derived from hernia discal surgery last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in an induced coma from that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus being able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, a sequel to a disc hernia operation in Paris on November 26.
The singer was once again operated on Wednesday night on Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, to whom she attended her daughter Jade, to witness a school act, confirmed a photographer of the AFP.
The head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the hospital of the Pitié-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer last November 26 at the Monceau Park's international private clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
It's talking about a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem with making the trip, because I was operated twice as a disc hernia, he added.
Just before at the RTL station, he indicated that apparently the singer had "lost canula, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, she also spoke to actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed following brain hemorrhage.
It is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the justice system on several occasions for malapraxis, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" demanded "with regularity" before the Council of Order, and is "quite of being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any drawback" and that the results of the post-operative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not provoke bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
No doubt, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I find it very risky, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the label of the former giscardist party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, only to be sued of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF logo, as he believes that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, he received help from former Member Hervé de Charette (UMP, current NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF association's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the rights of ownership of the brand, on the sole penalty of judicial demand.
Over the past few days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose your political movement to recover the UDF label, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Attuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the +New Center+, and the slogan + the UDF of today+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, support the letter signatures.
As you already know, you have no right to use the label, explains the UDF office which requires the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any support, as well as of (his) Internet site".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (la) brand to legitimate possessors."
If it does not, justice will be appealed to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories will be warned.
In the letter, they need that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "elected" went in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre has no right to use the UDF label, according to them.
They also recall that in 2007 the last UDF congress voted for membership of MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, "when he registered the mark", he was no longer "member of the UDF since three years ago", but of the UMP.
It is scandalous and fraudulent to use the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do so on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before they mock the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make their own name than to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which it is not entitled."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to bring to trial the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenery to expose her to part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his pictures of stars of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years of imprisonment and 375,000 euros of fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered that 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt be subjected to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's heir and main shareholder has always refused to submit to such examinations, even under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday shall submit a report by 10 March 2010 in which they must state whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and during what periods.
I think you'll accept.
I'm going to talk to her, declared Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, on leaving the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer Olivier Metzner was pleased with the court decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, said.
For two years now, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter started criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of her mother's weakness for years in order to obtain a billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers to be a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations were, on occasion, a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she mistrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, as counsel: "I could explain to my daughter who wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
From his wedding, I could never speak to Françoise again."
On the other hand, the National Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre once again considered that the plaintiff was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardian judge had refused, in the last few days, to give rise to his request to open a judicial custody procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under custody and has no guardian.
No other person may appear in place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be handed down.
Management Revolution or End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of employees joining the "values" determined from above as before that it was intended to impose on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to the strategies of conquest of the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to the preference factors of the customers is repeated regularly.
Demobilization of employees can end up in deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially of R & D and, even more, of business intelligence.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive behaviour and a prospective vision"; employees need a commitment that is entirely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would consist of putting the employees in the centre of the company's concerns as well as the client.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative usefulness
Will internal opinion surveys, such as Orange's questionnaire among its employees, encourage management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many times, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
-Last, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the major engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the ancient conductist theory that the U.S. "no-sciences" recently re-activated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the executives' engagement, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a mechanical management position, inadequate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the good functioning of modern companies involves adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating in all business management reasoning or practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motif Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a default dosage that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of mobilisation factors, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and re-use the management of human resources "in place".
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo Speech: by the "Just War" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech that Obama had spoken on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the award to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, Mrs. Palin, a leading figure in the right wing of the Republican party to the US Today newspaper, and she added that she herself had addressed the war theme "sometimes necessary" in her recent published memories.
In my opinion, war is of course the last thing that Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, devoted, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At the moment, the speech seemed very historical, Gingrich said, during an interview on the "The Takeaway" radio program.
The former elected representative, who some consider as a potential candidate for republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a president of the left" when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current columnist in Washington Post, Obama pronounced "a very American speech."
In addition to being "the citizen of the world", as "always does", "he spoke as an American president" when he reminded the Europeans "who live in a security bubble they didn't create and do not do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few not very convinced right-wing, a Bush-era hawk, the former UN ambassador, John Bolton, called the speech of "monotonous, pretentious and lack of inspiration" on the National Online Review website.
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left-central press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his "superproduction" speech especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's discourse "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," commented the California newspaper.
Obama "pronounced the discourse that was necessary," thought the New York Times, judging it "at the same time as dark and upbuilding."
Road transport: three Marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three Marathon negotiations, the road unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement ending the strike slogan and the threat posed by the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "joyed" by the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators fired at the dawn of Friday, hoping to quickly sign the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even when three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by giving a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours beginning at 11 a.m. was necessary for all to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "was very damaging to businesses" and "it was feared to disturb the end of the year parties," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for lower wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9 per cent for higher (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8,72 euros to 9,06 for low wages.
Not much, but we started with much disadvantage, said Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants that there are no more cuts or locks in the supply centres.
But there can always be a broken rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is a "good agreement", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense that respects the employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) declared, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is an "acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will mainly address the issue of extraordinary pay and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a drop of EUR 100 million in employers' burdens" was the subject of an amendment by the government in the Draft Reform Finance Act for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
TLF's signature allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to companies that are members of this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, if the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "with the quickest," Bussereau assured.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR reported that it was a "ingenuous trade", since the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to compensate for some of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who want to eat turkey at the next dinner in Nochebuena, Unostra lamented.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector for the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, unions that disagree with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, because at the Friday meeting, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their award request.
For this important Christmas weekend, only trains will be running between 10 and 20 hours on Saturday and Sunday, at the rate of one train every two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
Lafayette Galleries, which await 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "RATP is striving to provide service to the large shops."
The RER A cross from west to east the Parisian city.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one out of two trains circled in peak hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the Andeans thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Isle of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbabina explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to get to time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not get tired, said SNCF, which had provided for police and law enforcement supervision.
The RERs operating the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or destined to it arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analyzed, "slowly satisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that took place with the management on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (South) claiming a premium.
RATP even put its premium proposals in parenthesis, commented indignantly on the CGT, noting that the management "was unable to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of practice of the profession," said RATP.
What also led the unions to say that the company "does not care about end-of-week users".
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the direction, which was denied until then to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents had submitted a notice.
The trade unions request a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line with one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the prokurdo party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main procuring party, a decision that immediately provoked manifestations of wrath in the Kurdish community, in the Southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which has just helped the Kurdish community to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that undermined the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dissolution, said Kilicz, and added that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and the deputy Aysel Tugluk, are separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity of which Türk and Tugluk enjoyed, and the confiscation of the property of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before being parliamentarians without a partisan label.
The decision arises following a procedure launched by the Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and by many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party asserts that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Tribunal's verdict is at the time when the government is holding a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures that strengthen its rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus put an end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders stated that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the Southeast Anatoly, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of arrest of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters met in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of Southeast mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order Forces dropped tear grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters launched Molotov bombs or stones with Hondas.
In Istanbul, about one hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was to "profound the despondent."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
Nothing is resolved, declared the Minister of Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This boycotted decision completely the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can of course expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was charged with an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in recent months.
Snows can start suddenly
A truly fresh winter is what Wolfgang Braenburger wants.
It's absolutely something you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in the winter of the EDF
But with this your employees can learn to test and dominate all the technology of the vehicle.
Weather scientists may announce it for the first time on the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to handle snow and ice.
In this case the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections with large salt vehicles, explains Braenburger.
For example, the main arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also the access to the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and sections with earrings, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The EDF service starts around three o'clock in the morning
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which is better attached.
That's why the EDF starts around three o'clock in the morning, "with this the roads are free until the traffic of the peak hours begins."
The difficulty is when it starts to snow around 7:30 a.m.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for salt vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, which also belong to the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the lateral and secondary streets.
That's where the nuisances are generated, Braubburger knows well.
Around five o'clock in the morning, the FES infantry is launched, mainly dangerous points and cruises are taken off.
In general, the EDF could not take over all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 p.m. does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Braenburger.
As these are quickly wrenching, the salted vehicle is starting as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa found the same look as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal of two meters long and 1.50 meters tall that ran over the two strong hind legs, had a broad head with sharp teeth and curves, short arms with hoz-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa foundae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of Texas University in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards early evolution of dinosaurs, comments Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation in Ghost Ranch in northern Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found in one day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is something unprecedented for Triasic sediments, reports Randall Irmis member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were brought together in total.
A finding confirms the theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "Triasic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other experts in dinosaurs do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
The experts thus discuss, for example, when the sauries were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous teropods among those found in Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velocipator and also birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivoros (sauriums with bird pelvis), to which, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus belong.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa foundae is a primitive teropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, comments Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa, researchers found signs of airbags, such as those that also own the descendants of the teropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, bird breathing is more efficient than mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the bones of the spine were evidently filled with air in part.
Tawa is the teropod with the oldest and most primitive airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of later giant sauropods also possessed air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers suggest that the sauris appeared there for the first time.
Therefore, the three genealogical lines separated at first and spread from South America through all corners of the earth, which by that time still formed a unique earth mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa found the remains of two other not very closely related teropods.
The three cannot descend from a single parenter, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migratory waves have been given to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of brothers from dinosaurs, lived in the present-day Poland, comments the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
Your opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many fossils of dinosaurs continue to be preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare sideline from reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in Triasic dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example, the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosauri and many other sauris.
Towards the end of the Triasic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct at the limit of the Triasic towards the Jurassic.
Successive Stories Were Not Eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It may have given a massive extinction to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the competitors in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact brakes the rise of a group of species, which had already evolved in the Triasic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, in California.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino at Goethe University of Frankfurt had an impact all over the world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, although also from higher education centers throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are united with the students in protest at the Campus de Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, "reject" the police eviction promoted by the Governing Council.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, had the building occupied last week by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served to "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and diverted the attention of the content.
The Governing Council has refused to initiate the necessary negotiations.
Teachers require the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimate protest
Young people from the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also united with students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, comments the national youth secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the university and police director.
We are grateful to the university director.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, commented on a broadcast by Aksuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Wiesbaden province parliament.
We are understanding the protest, but we are not understanding the vandalism, said Peter Beuth, provincial parliament delegate for the CDU.
The view of opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of carefully studying the students' arguments and demands, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret investigation of arms.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered the "Silicon Valley Russian".
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted Riedberg's scientific office in Frankfurt, university institutes and enterprises at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
A number of mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol of Close Collaboration" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor, Juri Roslkak and Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt signed the Chief of Planning Services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Sciences Research Centre.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set a foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research companies and institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the major consortia of Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for arms research.
Selenograd (translated literally as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, where research facilities settled.
Stuttgart brakes
Stuttgart 21's Dimension is not set for anything high enough.
For the project's supporters, this is simply and clearly the "new heart of Europe".
The law alone. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rieles, which end in the middle of the city, were then considered fossils of engineering of the 19th century, which acted as brakes of a modern rail traffic, since it had previously taken a huge amount of time to catch the locomotives from back forward.
Roll, stop the journey dry; but so must be done.
And that's why the terminals must have disappeared in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is located about half the route of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Corazón de Europa".
The S21 will really be started, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
Rail terminals of course do not have any more problems of entry and exit, provided there are reversible locomotives with tractor drive and driver's car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE built towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have made such a determination.
The railway continues, too, because the risks of the major individual infrastructure projects in the Republic are driven by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
New urban space is created, equipped with many green areas, probably from computer graphics generated by the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and the road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be taken care of to strengthen freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road trucks.
However, the new construction sections are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than EUR 6 billion must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe it is more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other crossings and narrow passages on the network.
A total of 60 major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long rivers across the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the plot has been built on a slow step.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator as it is proper.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment on the airport.
The federal government is leaving pending in the Wiesbaden autonomous parliament, if it is going to file an appeal before the ruling on the prohibition of night flights from the Hesse Administrative Court.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have entrusted experts with the legal investigation into the judgment of the VGH, more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had reasoned in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the north-west runway planned at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to reschedule the prohibition of night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition must decide until 4 January, if it is to file an appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and pressured government representatives to resign the appeal to the National Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It is quite difficult, if one lets one fulfill his word, said the chief of the Tarek Al-Wazir greens, referring to the FDP slogan "We fulfill our word."
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federative government would be attempting through misappropriation of the law and tricks still obtain their night flights.
A comprehensive legal investigation would take a lot of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally binding decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition points out, it would never have been his group's assertions about the prohibition of nocturnal air traffic.
The U.S. banks return the aid provided.
The large U.S. banks shaken by the crisis strip off their state ties.
The "Bank of America" returned once and for all the aid provided by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of EUR 45,000 million (approximately EUR 30. billion).
And also the Citi Group plans to return state aid, according to a U.S. CNBC report.
With this, the institutes intend to get rid of the restrictions they had gone out of hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had earned approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had a lot of means, among other things by selling rubles.
Banking Director Kenneth Lewis particularly thanked US taxpayers on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the efforts of the bank to absorb investments in the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also seeks to raise money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations vis-à-vis the state.
CNBC reported from a source of known circles, that the U.S. bank could now announce for this Thursday the increase of its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June they had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
At the end, everything was faster than it was thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative council of the ZDF (German television channel) press the editor Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may introduce a successor.
Last night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it probably also influenced not to harm the ZDF director Markus Schächter any more if this proposal would not be approved on the administrative board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet specific to the closure of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed the administrative board with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's removal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Why the majority of the Union in the administrative council had indicated weeks before the election, that they would not support Brender in its position.
The opposition to the chief of drafting had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr.Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, which under the direction of Brender the ZDF news reports would have lost audience rates.
Up until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was flogged.
At the end, 35 experts in public law had even joined the debate, who described Koch's course as unconstitutional.
But it didn't do anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Roman philology.
He later worked at the "Südwestfunk" station and the "Frankfurter Rundschau" newspaper.
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the "heute-journal" information.
Next seasons: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The Greens political party announced a constitutional demand after Brender's removal, which was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Koch's opposition to the administrative council, the president of the Rhine-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federated states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of politicians in favour of the ZDF control guilds was discarded by Beck.
Brender's probable successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative board with an intelligent move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence both Schächter could appoint him for the post of chief editor without losing his face, as the administrative council could vote him, without falling under suspicion of giving him the post to a partisan sequestration.
In the calculations of the Frey parties is awarded anyway to the left-wing liberals.
University careers take off
Part success for students: after a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the Länder finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of degree and master.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module in the race must end with one exam.
It is also intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of results of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The federated states undertake to more flexiblely make the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master careers.
Rules of the Federated States that differ from this must no longer exist.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the directors of the universities are constantly talking about the improvement in the ability to achieve and successfully complete a career (studyability).
Now for the first time we talked about a particular content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single examination", it is said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the "sensitive reduction in the burden of examinations" it is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studyability" should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as regards unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to more spaces, which enable and promote their own initiative."
These rules would apply to new careers, but also to the examination of existing careers.
These must be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take up to 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is established by the federated states.
The ministers of education and culture urged the federated states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
To date only Renania-Platinada has assured that it will provide additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counselling programs, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The federal state and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wanted to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, a single review should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should become more flexible, besides ensuring recognition of assessments at other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all the careers about its "studyability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of studying in the federated state.
Apart from the commendations, there were also criticisms about decisions.
In the Federal Council of the Juso University Groups (Youth Socialists) it was necessary that the configuration of education policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, students as the main participants should be able to take an opinion as well.
The president of the board of university directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the student experience," said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which HRK decided on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the Bachelor's degree the possibility of accessing a post Master's career.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough study places for Master with the best possible conditions of study. This was reported by a member of GEW, Andreas Keller.
The federated states have to meet a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education made no comments.
More than a note to the foot about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is done practically without control" says the first line of a poem by lyric Werner Söllner in unbalanced idimatic fragments, in which he themes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several awards for literature, and in 1993 he taught the memorable poetry lectures or lectures in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
God who spoke quite a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its security records"
Obviously insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Security against German-Roman writers colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
The recruitment attempts had slowly begun in early 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who did not defend himself sufficiently in the face of attempts to provoke fear of security," Söllner concluded.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time of the award of the Nobel Prize in literature to Herta Müller and his unmatched literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania for a case that shows the abismos and the wickedness of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, so far known, not only author, but also victim.
In his file on Security IM Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and he stressed the influence for him positive of theIM Walter.
He had excused or defended him at all the hard points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this claim," he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not as surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Security-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in the month of July in the weekly "Zeit", after reading his own 914-page file.
Those involved would certainly have speculated and would have known in some cases what names were hidden behind Sorin, Voicu and Walter's pseudonyms.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment of security control files is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and makes it difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the safety records (CNSAS), under the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather traced.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, shows that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former chief of Temesvar Security spoke despectively of the decoration.
"She has psychosis," she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be shown unturned in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as many times when there is a guilty silence.
Why right now? Who was caused harm? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession lets hope that the continuation of this story will be more governed by the cravings of knowledge and not so much by the award of blame and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, it is more than a simple note to the foot.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his equipment's supplier, approached a Class C Mercedes taxi a quarter hour after midnight, gave the impression that an elegantly dressed external service member was coming out of a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man of the bald feature had hired a driver because he had not yet met the city.
In other words, he could also drive the car himself: in the end, there was no alcohol at stake, nor was he drunk of joy the 55-year-old man.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow the work would begin again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we reach the eighths of the finals", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the decline."
The "more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the everyday life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evident again, after the rapid three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Chance
The eighth finals of the Champions League (going 16/17 and 23/24 February/return 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So joy was kept limited by the fulminant entry of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who in a short time had inspired them to the disconcerted professions of Stuttgart to trust themselves, ready to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to concentrate on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the Gross soul repairer his recipe for success that so simple sounds, but that with the Babbel therapist no longer had any effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impetus arises in football, sometimes things happen that have not been believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a period of several weeks due to an injury, immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to her dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wine" and the way to work for the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what was obviously missing when Babbel was.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the sports director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs mostly constancy.
Like Gross, players and administrators also refrained from overvaluing the triumph against a weakened defense due to lack of relief and totally outsmart of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, gave thought to Khedira.
And management Horst Heldt warned that although one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We haven't dealt with the problem yet.
Heldt had no desire to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters for three months ago, it was due to the events of the weekend, which were re-updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by doorkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others, and not Jens, faced Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
The latter had blamed weakness in the direction of the governing council, which had decided to change as a coach because of pressure from the teenage fanatics.
Also that his day would have been eliminated after the games called it Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by the pure selfishness," said Heldt, and announced consequences for the last.
You'll probably not be friends forever, the two of you.
But at least they agreed with all the others that, without prior efforts with the team of the replaced coach, it would not have been possible to perform great force of play and battle.
Babbel and his assistants had "a significant share in success," said Heldt and Lehmann at the same time; and also agreed with the man of the plastic suitcase.
World heavyweight championship competition
Burning duel in Bern: Again and again the rector Kevin Johnson was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judge's trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version won on Friday night on Saturday in Bern to the U.S. Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainian was twice a world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the night that everyone had expected could not be accomplished.
Klitschko extended his balance sheet to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to be overcome due to his injuries.
Reactor Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
Before about 17000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, which before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging over and over the world champion's blows, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right.
Generally speaking, the Johnson liability did too little for a rector, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the rectator had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
I had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," who "knows nothing."
When weighing out, the champion was provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "in order to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a pause of almost four years, he defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at that time, and had recovered his WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year later won in his defences of the title to Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after which he landed in November to Nikolai Valugev, 2.13 meters tall.
In the summer before, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
The company that is promoting it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack on the opposition: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Defence Minister Gutenberg a liar because of false information on the Kunduz case.
The SPD and leftists require explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the most recent revelations about the Kunduz air strike, the opposition has blamed the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), for knowingly misleading the case.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast by the ARD television channel, the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "did not know the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been taken into account without regard to the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and which Mr Gutenberg has read, said Trittin.
Friday it had been announced that in this attack it was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air attack, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, died or were injured up to 142 people.
Greens, the SPD and the left urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately to the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel had to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder was part of Afghanistan's policy of the federal government, and whether the Chancellor, the Army and the Information Service had approved this new strategy, they demanded Jürgen Trittin and his green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected criticism.
The Chancellor's office did not influence any of the specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the Ministry's presentation on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the surroundings of the two high-ranking officials, they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a field patrol report.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has not received an answer, it was said.
The ministry did not manifest itself on Saturday with respect to the reproach made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Unique Worlds
In a state of alertness, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and drug addicts do they fade the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can freely deliver ourselves to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, who experiences sleep-like states during the day, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is considered most of the time in the modern Western world as mad or drug addict, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drugged.
The guilt is our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes make the limits between sleep, madness and reality be unraveled.
The alertly modified states of consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the psychodelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
hallucinations or deliriums occur when the balance of the neuronal substances of communication in the brain has been released – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
Very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over it
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of alertness, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness to the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the disproposed, formations allocated, and mirrors of it."
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
His body is two dimensions and scandalously colored.
Gravity no longer has power over it, is floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red mussels like blood, deformed, brushing their teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain in the whole body.
Striking and malignant voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult him and offend him.
Henning T. starts two stereo cables, binds them to form a hanging knot, and fastens them on a hook on the roof.
It goes up in a jar and puts the knot around the neck.
Jump.
The rope's loose.
What a lesson for you!, they shout in a chorus that revives the tympanics, "Go to the clinic and make them cure you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, and it is manic-depressive, taking medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time the affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, disturbances in the relationship, or persecution.
Especially extended is the hearing voices: voices that give commands, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the assemblies to a stream of ideas and fantasies coming from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor at the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of events, all has a meaning to it.
At the same time it enters a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle such."
Paranoic thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distance from experience takes place in reality.
For the researchers still an incognito the why our brain makes them cabriolas.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency may lead anyone to lose contact with reality on a provisional basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that besides genes there are also other determinants.
Researchers assume that the affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain’s neuronal maturity is affected in an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it's still an incognito how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which is also not manifested at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience can be the detonators of a psychosis when there is already a previous disposition.
Likewise, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain transmitter system.
When the Brain Warms
The illogical point of all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Sensing a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The unreal world in our head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
These include, along with psychic disorders such as personality boundary disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and craneocephalic trauma .
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or poorly controlled; when our brain is warmed, but also when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, evil of love or other exceptional brain states.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Hallucination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attended a secondary school.
A common girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a boy clumsy with long and dark hair directs the word.
When she answers her, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl's a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. She knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she's watching and hearing that guy, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting in the bank next door.
You can even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes he asks if he's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he's in class sometimes he can't follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest he clearly and audible explains the mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, you can't distinguish whether it's awake or dreaming, if the images you see, the mues or the girl with bleeding cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
His parents and friends haven't told him anything, they think he's crazy.
In the fall of 2009. Sarah K. She is 20 years old today.
He approved selectivity last year and lives with his boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations have gone missing.
Ever since he's been in contact with psychologist Kasten on the Internet, he knows he's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art for despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and it's the same as looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he found out that the man he calls Dad since he has the use of reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and noisy impressions, those affected as Sarah K. It is hard to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "has a place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, physically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Limitation between sleep and hallucination
in this far-reaching world, imaginative experiences usually pathology, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor at the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a tough and painful disease that also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
The oneiric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later cannot differentiate from being awake.
Oniric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis being fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor incapacity, it replaces a real situation that is very dangerous by a world of its own and imaginary which is decoupled from reality.
A form of limit situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation remains in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unsurpassable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his unique experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his consciousness got on several days' trips after an operation of heart transplanted heart valves, while his body was sentenced to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by himself and visited strange places of other times: he saw himself lying in bed, a grown man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with snowflake and found himself a Korean mafia.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in the irrelevant details.
Lighter and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
The children will take charge of the editorial at 27 years old
The new publisher Kallen has come to an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, commented SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the family's hands.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs with 27 years of age and have the strong desire to enter the company, Burda, 69 years of age, confirmed SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are trained for it.
One cannot put in front of 7,500 workers their children, if they are not trained enough for it.
That would end up with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from the presidency of the Governing Board from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, of 52, has been a member of the Burda leadership since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took charge of the treasury and thus came responsibility for the company’s assets. After the exit of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the stamp of the editorial.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old. Their son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the family's hands.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are not safe from decadence: "This has always affected families who are allowed to be infected by the pursuit of capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I've never had "magnificent delusions," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political precept in this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league; these businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything - in matters of beauty and well-being - you can wish, within the reach of your hand.
This is what appears to have been proposed The English Court, which has just inaugurated in Callao shopping center (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mimo of the body.
The spa, located on the octave plant, has prestigious signatures like Hedonai - who handles laser depilation-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, who owns a gymnasium, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the best views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to mount your own 'beautiful party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a champagne cup are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
A total of 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulitis or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts by introducing your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
Your director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdressing, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.

Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa electric company, together with the City Council of Barcelona, has created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' will define and coordinate the road map for the deployment of the electric car in the city and achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
It will also develop the MOVEL project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the deployment of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVEL Plan, to promote the deployment of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Cataluña.
This is intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has active a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main exporting sector.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has undertaken during the year to support the car sector.
"Without the Automation Competitiveness Plan, today we would have an overview of abandonment, closure of some of our main production plants," said the president of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and to the availability of the following brands in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (IPA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than €3 billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, in line with Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has enabled the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20.000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Hall of the Classic Vehicle will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the motor mountain.
This initiative will take place on 5-7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, with more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only classic motorcycles and automobiles can be found, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find all kinds of items related to the engine world.
Thus, among the pavilion exhibitors, accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, additions, publications, miniatures, etc. can be found.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sale; Juan Lumbreras, restaurant; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Cochera Classics, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Exams of skill in the exterior
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be complemented by parallel activities: concentration, sporting exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and contests.
Skill tests will also be performed with classic cars and motorcycles in a circuit enabled outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sports
Mazda wants to show that sports are not opposed to respect for the environment.
For this reason, the engine's stopping and start-up system, i-Stop, has just been incorporated into Mazda3, a device that is available at least for the moment only with the petrol engine 2.0 with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved throughout its whole.
The finishing, the finishing of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, we verify that the front boots present an excellent ergonomics and subjection.
The steering wheel's touch is also exquisite.
Following the set formed by the frame of instruments and the console we see as Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, to which everyone wants to beat.
Continued with the habitat, this Japanese compact has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
This adds a large and regular case.
The engine stop-and-start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre petrol engine and 150 horses and with the manual change of six gears.
This engine is a real delight. It excels for its fineness, for its reduced noise, for its benefits and for its content consumption.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometres a year should not discard this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high walking comfort and for its content consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is called Sportive, that is to say it incorporates a larger number of serial elements.
From the series equipment especially the rail exchange assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy tires.
In addition, if there was little equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: Bison adaptive headlamps and BOSE sound system with disc loader, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
In particular, it highlights the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not perform many kilometers per year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the petrol engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us large doses of satisfaction every day.
Luxury premium
L. A. covers the red carpet sensuality of Penélope Cruz's hand, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars shed more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexy' on the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing him on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
Given the success of the company has taken out two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free life data service in return for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as its U.S. counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, from about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those travelling with a smartphone already know what it is like to have to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately looking for a café with WiFi (or a connection from Fon) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the little letter.
The European Commission's repeated earstries to achieve affordable roaming rates for all of Europe have only had a perceptible effect.
Out of the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (it doesn't stop being curious that bears the name of Fon when you don't have Wifi) gets this kind of rate means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no gaitas.
It's a connected device and it's paid for by buying it, not month by month.
And that's what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a life access purchase option like the one Peek already has in the United States.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If you have already come to Barack Obama's possession as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, you have chosen the same to accompany you in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of your life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has carried a very similar model on two occasions: in addition to being a similar color - greenish yellow with bright reflections - the two times the act was made up of three pieces - dressed, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady in the United States was following the star of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat the vestarium.
But the fabric on which the two costumes are made makes them very different.
If for taking possession of a fat lace, in Oslo it is a pencil with print.
The additions have also varied: green shoes of medium heel the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a picked up on this occasion, melena looses the previous.
75% of working mothers have had labour problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women in younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and career path of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey conducted between 9,737 women between 15 and 75 years of age leaves no doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen job opportunities limited due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences at the beginning of coexistence in couples and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an out-of-home activity, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, start living together in couples, advance their first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and maternity, and have fewer descendants.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after beginning their cohabitation, an increase of 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time than their vital path to achieve them, which has led them to postpone union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity even less on the timing of pairing," says researcher Margarita Delgado CSIC.
The level of studies is another factor that varies the age of women at marriage and at first age.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they get married and the older the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher studies have for the first time been mothers at the 25.1 and 32.1 average, respectively.
"An additional division is established between women depending on their level of education.
While those with elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, middle-level or higher-level ones invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to his envy list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
As of next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, playing the universal slogan of 'Because I am worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses in the international panorama, joins other famous prints of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones to enter such select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Perdidos') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His highest representatives - designers and models, of yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of his awards, held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the date.
The former Jerry Hall model and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
The Poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent gives some thirty X-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearsome genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but seeks something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The journey has its excitements and Vicent does not save sutures or lighting.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
Here I leave you some snapshots.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same as I felt without a name: pleasure against the aciago destiny, guiltless morals and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihillist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he conjugated the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8,000-metre peaks of universal literature, which has to climb through the north wall, from which the best mountaineers are drawn over and over again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
On his own, he sometimes said he was heir to a county landlord and others who was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry from a bridge by that Munich character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and did it on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking to posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ rest after the war,/ after life the very well pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband would normally accept that she told him that Eduardo VII was spying on her in the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
The case of such a patient and in love with a neurotic man whose literary talent was in front of his madness has never been seen."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Saints do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to do but go to Baroja for Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cell but abdicate the fame of that man to serve him as his own pedestal?"
Coward aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people aged 15 to 18 went by with her and our dog, a mestizo-breeding specimen, rescued from the dog and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, provided her with two kicks that left the stray dog.
Our outrage is capitalized because we did not find fun in a free assault on a small, helpless animal, which by the way was tied.
To this it must be added the suffocation that caused a woman to walk quietly and who, when she added to these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energum that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at 5:00 p.m. on a Tuesday evening, any one for a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubted it would be useful for a lot and not to generate susceptibility, just to clarify that the killer cowards were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to abuse a helpless animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among the younger drivers, today both entities reported.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only protection element capable of avoiding head injury or even death in case of an accident while riding on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products" and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, in order to achieve maximum dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin highlighted that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, as being a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main aims is to develop increasingly secure products.
Moves up the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.6 per cent in 2008 and, most importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to the figures of the employers of the Anfac manufacturers and of the sellers Ganvam.
The good data, which is not surprising, should be put in quarantine, since the reference to which the comparison is made -November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of the last month, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous fiscal year.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the small commercial tailor case: tourist derivatives, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks/light charges.
Also, no nubarrons that most affect their demand have disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, paying almost 100% of the cases through external funding.
So the restrictions of the closed bank credit grid must add other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In view of this picture and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has recently been used.
In addition to private individuals, the autonomous and SMEs that are going to purchase a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been shown.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The sales association predicts 2010 similar to the end of the year, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As has happened with the ABS brake antilock and will pass with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all new registrations and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of shortage is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although, by its way of working, it can also help to prevent many collisions by scope.
The emergency brake assistant does what is to increase pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the pedestrian that gives the driver.
But this one doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car component manufacturer, the third of the drivers involved in an accident had not stepped the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance the car uses to stop.
According to an EU study itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents could be avoided each year in which pedestrians are involved.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four sinisters would be avoided with damage to people - when the so-called emergency braking intelligent systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or camera) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, as well as acts slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps to increase pressure on the pedal if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts the utmost effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delay until January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - on 8 probably - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europa, wants is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the party concerned.
And this can cause the final document to be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, from GM it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken within the next few days.
This is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM supports contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but forces the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which is supported by the Russian Converg group.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its final, and expensive jewelry, Porsche engineers took Boxster S as a base and made it thinner no less than 80 kilograms, which left the scale in just 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to refrain, first, from the automatic ceiling that has been supplied by a hand-operated canvas, thereby saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'caen' others 15; removing the air conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, gained 7 kilos; mounting other 12 sports bacquets and with the light 19 inch tires, five.
Finally, renouncing the CDR-30 audio system provided another six kilograms and changing the door handles by some of the screen, the remaining kilograms.
Although it is also offered with the double clutch PDK change, the test was performed on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly by secondary roads in California, in mountain sections with really overturned plots
Your behavior can only be considered to be unattainable.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not tread the asphalt with aplom.
Rather, the opposite: we had not been testing a model so small and light that at the same time it would transmit so much security in the curve step, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short march for as long as necessary, until we order him to display, to slow down, to recover and repress his engine...
What we ask you for. Thanks to your direction, as communicative as accurate, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine roar, already squeezed earlier in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from stopping or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Spyder Boxster was quite punished, but the car did well digest the berries.
The electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in one of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, as well as early in the morning.
Finally, a ultralight car, of the most fun driving that one can on the market and that is something more than a simple modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.

Baskonia’s Victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a brilliant triumph for 82-91 on his visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite the numerous casualties of the Dusko Ivanovic team, and thus is located in the leadership of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 rating).
The Victorian team knew how to overcome the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work even though it had to suffer to the end in order to win.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triple notes had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The game started face-to-face for the tiles, which started in front of the marker.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already premonstrated that they had jumped to the Israeli court with the hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artists from 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more than the same, but the team applauded the interior game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was received with well-dressed and applause on the return to his home, to continue expanding his advantage at rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Sprinter's 'less six' rating already made it appear that this would not be the best night in Brazil.
But the party, despite being incarcerated at rest, was not decided at all, and the Maccabees wanted to remind the victors that in their field they didn't win any, and with 'Elias''' hand pressed them to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the return to light (50-49).
More disadvantages
Ivanovic's, wounded but not much less dead, needed to hilarize a couple of moves with correctness to catch air, and in them came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a restorative income (54-67), which managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The applause went out to leave the skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take what had been deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's men did not rush, defended well, and even though the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the party had already owned and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv first in the season.
Illnesses Prevent Fighting the Unicaja · Global Voices
The Unicaja lost sharply in Greece before the Olympics and gave him the leadership of Euroliga Group B, in a party marked by the casualties of the cashiers, especially in the interior game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malague team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship flag and neither by the rival's entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of Omar Cook's base and one of Guillem Rubio's, dis praised the premises 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the interior game with Bouroussis, Vujcic and Scortsanitis, turned to the score 22-20, minute 13, when an action, coincided with fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, assumed the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing its superiority within both areas, where the fall due to injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal shortcomings of Carlos Jiménez, were looting the cajists.
Between the indoor players and the Lithuanian alert Linas Kleizas, with its triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible climb
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacus, which despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even matched the difference of the meeting played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group leadership slammed.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last fall of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences the One by the leadership and the triples of Cook, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacus when he pressed and given his superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to remount the basketball charge 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went off, delivering the leadership to the Olympiacus.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the searcher with the highest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the wages of users from more than 140,000 job offers available in Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they should introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the searcher has detected that the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement Trovit product manager, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from his researchers in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges €45,226 gross annually and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 receiving a Spanish one.
Similarly, a driver charges €34,247 net annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of waitress, with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by the dependent, with 14,725 euros; and the worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought jobs in the network in the last three months are drivers, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets date to the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has termed Manuel Zelaya's residence at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President's depot shall leave the diplomatic bond by 27 January 2010 at the latest when he officially completes his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows it must leave before that date of the embassy, where it remains a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on 27 January, when he has finished his term, he has to seek another destination."
The station also quoted the former commissioner, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya the condition of political asylum that he intended to impose on him the "de facto" government that President Roberto Micheletti had.
Thank you very much.
After the wine and rose days since last spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant point in the markets, the uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which should not surprise since it is its natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar to near-zero types for financial entities to buy discount assets.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically completed and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, begin to put some sand on the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the Stock Exchanges and the differentials of the corporate bonds have re-occurred, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Once again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the eurozone countries' differentials with regard to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened a new revision at the fall of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, there is little uncertainty about bringing back moral risk defenders who were trying to raise awareness of global economic policy officials because they have curbed the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when it will be necessary to decide a new day of Thanksgiving action.
However, what of Dubai depicts a tribal struggle between the emeritus to recompose power in the Emirates and that of Greece we have already seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls out of the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from failure to comply with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a member country of the euro to breach its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expectation.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differentials expand as well as European corporate bonds we should not worry about.
If the European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
What Standard & Poor's is an anecdotal. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not wish much life expectancy for their warning.
Again, it has all the painting that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, driver friend".
Related sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which this day the energy strategy of Spain is discussed in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few pinceladas of what he had raised in the subcommission at closed doors.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not amount to 60 billion, but to up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola considers that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but at distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 on, the issue has changed and power will have to be increased.
Its commitment focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that there is a need for 18,000 new MW, that is, with other "support energies".
Galán, who considers that the draft Sustainable Economy Act just passed by the Government is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term commitment" in this regard, despite the "point" measures, as called them by the President of Iberdrola.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, should begin to be taken as long as they are mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus 'handling' in ten airports
The Ferrovial subsidiary for airport services on land, Switzerland Swissport, will play the role of a favourite partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it has presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most prominent.
The agreement, which has not crossed economic terms, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá of Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The partnership includes an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50 per cent corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Share your first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Action fights for its first concession highway in Australia, where it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at $1.7 billion (about €1.047 million).
The French Bouygues and Sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the closest option for Action to settle in the country as a builder and concessionaire of highways.
City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to advance the project, in a business plan guarded by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do with the work and exploit the toll.
Pending the submission of bids next May, the planned investment amounts to $1.7 billion (EUR 1,047 million) and in the final phase, three consortia with a remarkable presence of European builders.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Actiona, the only Spanish-speaking group, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the action team, the consortium Northern Direct plays, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield infrastructure manager and the French builder Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed is the so-called LBRJV, where Australia's Leighton (filial of the German builder Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala specializing in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatisations, but it has a clear difficulty in entering unless it is through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be an outstanding subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% participation in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Assets millionaires
Action is wagered by a geographical area of the highest importance for the sector, in which it has already high presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalation business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies to raise and manage the Adelaide desalator, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and operation of infrastructure.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Infrastructure Office of Brisbane City and called Northern Link (northern link), is called to join the West Highway of Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. This is the most important action to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The schedule marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars ($308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear significant fruit to Hochtief, who reported yesterday that a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The ACS participation will enable, through its Leighton local branch, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give German work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still about to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, you will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a Slovenian motorway amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The firm obtains this contract days after it is done with the Bosruck tunnel expansion works (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in building tunnels.
The start of the work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation deadline will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awarded the advertising of Renfe
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros annually, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs. Rushmore has been elected from among the 16 agencies that were presented to the contest convened by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Many 63 million to France Télécom for slowing down competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephones with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this penalty, the old French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for blocking its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, indeed, has been increased because the competition authority considers France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a repeat.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile company has followed the stars of other operators and has opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries, such as Spain.
Play the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça from its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that more money have won in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue from major clubs.
So much so, the competition has distributed EUR 5.362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was set up in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well off from this division.
The white club has been the third in the continent who has spent more money on participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct Europe Cup in 1992 is the fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern from Munich, the two teams who also billed more money for participating in the Champions League.
And that, despite losing both of them in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chairing Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million by the Champions League.
From this money UEFA will devote 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the pre-classification round (including the Madrid Athletic) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just because they were there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each dispute party.
There is also bonus to win (800,000 euros) and draw (40,000 for each team).The eighthfinalists will receive three million each; the eight fourthfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be paid 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça, on the other hand, paid $2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is of the main, and has four seats assigned.
The champion of the previous year remained with 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of games played in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group broke down yesterday the details of the offer of purchase of shares with which it seeks to acquire a top of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for the whole of the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per action which would be paid in 10 years and would be paid with an interest for this 1% annual postponement
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa is worth 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Group of Georgia provides 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of the offer, even though the Ruiz Mateos company stated that it had contacted the regulator.
If this were to happen, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his address.
In an attempt to remain out of the possibility of buying and judicial bids from his former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes it the first woman to hold a high office in the food business.
This is a new creation post that will depend directly on the group chair.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company continues to engage in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos reveals new diversions of funds
With regard to the claim to the Salazars, the former Councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared yesterday at the National Court that they approved the detour of 212 million without knowing their fate.
CNMV authorizes the Paternina exclusion opa that introduced Investora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized yesterday the exclusion opa presented by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by understanding that its terms are in accordance with the rules in force and that it considers the contents of the explanatory leaflet submitted after the amendments made on 2 December.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is directed at the acquisition of 555,08 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to negotiation in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the rules in force.
New Car Perishing Tools
In these days of weather and accidents, not only do car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister disease are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No sinister is the same, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complicated work.
Computing the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces and manoeuvring, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of small
That's why almost 100% of experts use these types of systems.
Service providers and solutions for claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, and then to develop and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solara, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with their products.
The other firms competing in the field of taxation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from being simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, Spain works with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each provides them with information in different formats.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed does not cease to increase, to the extent that in the last five years more versions have been launched, variants and motorizations than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car goes to the market, these companies start to work.
It is a very hard job, because you have to cataloguate each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and introduce their price.
In addition, each model has a graphic image "intelligent" where different parts of tourism can be "painted".
If it's a sales model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars on sale in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models there is information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the circulating mobile park, they exceed 99%.
In order to carry out documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audadex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month there are 2.5 million data, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for the management of scraping parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports the value of the used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the AudaPlus star product, the standard sinister valuation solution for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and heavy or light industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bar.
This tool is paid according to use, for each rating.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of 10 times a month.
After each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on the vehicle moons, and AudaSubbastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows for the lift by declared car total loss.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by omodelas brands.
For example, it may be studied how many models of a particular brand have gone through the workshop because of accidents or how many severe sinisters have been experienced in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Commercializes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as provider of services and solutions for damage assessment, damage or maintenance of automobiles
The Gt Tax Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year in the last three years, and in 2008 they billed 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, their internationalization process began, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audadex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solar Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Reportex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19,1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solar Group was worth $1 billion in Stock Exchange, and now its shares are worth $2,400 million in total.
Since 2007 it has been quoted in the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of crashed cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or damaged special vehicles.
The operation involved a disbursement of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended to the remaining 15% in the year.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sale service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scrapers and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was set up in Germany in 1996 and runs over 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and some 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose number has been dropped cannot be recirculated, but can be used as spare parts that are not damaged.
Cars with historical value can be lifted even though they have been discharged after a fierce operation.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the replacement, creating the budget and generating the budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are, to a greater or lesser extent, more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourism, 109 allterrestrials, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with Internet connection is needed to use it.
Once the model has been identified to be repaired by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user may include variables such as the price of the workforce, charges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the one oriented to the workshop does not include estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently the Audatex company is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inside face.
