Members of the Galile Nation National Assembly are concerned that they may appear to be "merionate"
Many members of the Galiles National Assembly are upset because they have been suggested to change their title, respectively to be called MWP (Members of the Wales Parliament).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the Galile National Assembly is concerned that “it sends with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "feceal matter".
A member of the Wales Party of the National Assembly of Wales said that, as a whole, the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Party member said the group had an "open" attitude toward name change, but noted that "MWP" is similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation for the introduction of the name, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are named will certainly depend on even those members."
The Law of 2017 on the Government of Wales gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which have revealed that many of them want to use the "Gallan Parliament".
As regards the titles of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred "Members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the option "MWP" received the most votes in public consultation.
It seems that the members of the Galile National Assembly have suggested alternative options, but the attempt to reach consensus could give Elin Jones the head beat, the chairman of the steering committee, who is expected to send the draft law on changes over a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including the rules on the disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will have the last word as regards their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on the name change of the country
On this Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their view of changing their country's name in the "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was organised to resolve an old dispute with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens government has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and repeatedly opposed Macedonia 's accession to the EU and NATO .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on name change, said he would not take this vote into account.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is just a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bishops' Clowns have stopped fighting as a result of the problems faced by the churches in Harlem
"Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before you found a bar and a church in every corner of the street," Adams said.
“Today, there are no bars or churches.”
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he said.
“Bars no longer have the daily role for the entire neighborhood, where people usually gather.”
And with regard to churches, it is worrying that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than the leaders expect and that, “earnestly or later, the disintegration will be the same”.
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not support the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “so this will speed up the closing of churches, because it is unlikely that many people who move into these buildings will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations made up of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, made up of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African-American people, who were engaged in religious activities nearby, took over the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a congregation of Afro-Americans, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, which opposed the engagement or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but Father Johnson's enoriences made plans to rebuild it and included the carion in it.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, called the charillon "the bellies of the poor."
The expert who put the carion into operation in July described it differently: “a cultural treasure” and “a historical instrument to be unreplaced”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also said that he was the first carilon in the world acting by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who passed to a bigger carilon at Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What was heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by deacons of the church, others by episcopal diocese.
The church's governing entity, made up of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the church, even if it was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the thrilled ones complained about the lack of transparency he has given evidence of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old kid trying to catch lobsters in California
According to authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child, while he swims, trying to catch lobsters, in California, on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near the beach Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the KSWB-TV post in San Diego that he swims for about half an hour, along with his friends, on the morning of Saturday, when he heard a boy screaming for help and then moved along with a group that helped him to get him out of the water.
Hammel also said that initially he thought the boy was thrilled to catch a lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole clavicle was torn apart, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
“I cried out to all those who were in the water, and I told them to get out of the water: “There is a shark in the water,” Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The lifesaver, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that is a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the trunk.
The authorities restricted access from the Pointo beach from Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
The Healthbury retailer plans to strengthen his position on the market for beauty and fashion products in the UK
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, making available radiances with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a strengthening of the position on Britain's beauty products market, worth 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion sales are not to a great extent, larger radiances with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into several stores in the next year, if they prove to be a success.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for TV, microwave and household products.
The representatives of the Sainsbury relay said that the number of beauty products it offers will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaunchs its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, a growing demand for young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two shops of the Sainsbury chain for testing purposes, the first being the open one last week in Croydon, in the southern part of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director of the Sainsbury Retailer, said the outlets would increasingly look like universal stores, because supermarket chains are trying to deal with the big retail stores, Aldi and Lidl, which provide more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores, as well as Habitats, since it purchased both chains two years ago, which means that it has recorded increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The earlier attempt by the supermarket to reassert its pharmaceutical and beauty product compartments failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ceased after a divergence on how to share Boots' revenue in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business, which included 281 stores, Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds, three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury retailer, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our rays with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations turn us into an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way to make shopping".
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract
"Dragons' Den" TV Protagonist Peter Jones is furious after the TV presentation Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to get involved in their project on the Truly brand, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Pttrow.
Presentation of the 37-year-old ‘This Morning’ show announced that Instagram will withdraw.
Holly Willoughby generated Peter Jones' anger, the protagonist of the "Dragons‘ Den" show, with the latest retreat from their business offering lifestyle services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when one of the most beloved people on television admitted on Tuesday, during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, would no longer allow her to dedicate herself to their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and household items.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Ptrew's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's fortune with an estimated £11 million.
After the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would abandon the Truly contract, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
The statement of one source: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, there was less until the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the exhibitor of the "This Morning" show, which is among the best sellers in Britain, could bring to the company the damage of millions, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing objects and household items, as well as possible further delay of launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are ten-year-old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby set up the basis of the Truly brand together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S trade mark and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A nearby source of Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business. ”
I was very hard, and then "we fell in love"
He made jokes about the critics he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider to be "without a president" and about the fact that he has such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a big step back?
Trump said mimicking a voice of "the news presenter".
“I didn’t take a step back.”
He said that Kim is interested in having another meeting after the initial June meeting in Singapore was described by Trump as an enormous step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have ceased.
More than three months after the June Singapore summit, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not observe a "right response" from the United States on the previous disarmament marches of North Korea.
On the other hand, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"Everything goes well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said that his efforts to improve his relations with Kim had positive results: ending rocket tests, supporting the release of hostages and returning American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act like a president, but if I behave like that, instead of the 10,000 people outside, who are trying to enter this incapacitated arena, it would be about 200 people,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing the deaths of hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help is not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok Island population has been dislocated, no national disaster has been declared, a necessary condition for the launching of aid actions at international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it's a rather difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the “Save Children” Foundation is attempting to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesperson of the Agency for National Disasters, said the Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
In view of the earthquakes sustained by Indonesia, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be sufficiently prepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh , they are not often met on other coasts .
It seems that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued in this regard, could have contributed to the loss of lives.
Even in the best of circumstances, the journey between islands in Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters also complicate this.
A hospital ship that settled in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that the improvement of the precaution infrastructure in Indonesia be the central point of his electoral campaign and gave early money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds affected Joko's administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from Indonesian sectarians, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes, as Christian and Muslim gangs have huddled on the streets, using bricks, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the rescuer the goal and match the score in the game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a step from Xherdan Shaqiri, while it was about 30 meters away from the opposing team gate, and his team was driven by Chelsea by 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a whistle in the direction of the gates.
The ball reached above the one, heading towards the corner of the right at the top of the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed by Kepa Arrisabalaga who jumped to her and fell into the gate.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to move forward as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge said for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think very much about it, just, I took the ball further."
Chelsea drove 1-0 to the break after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the minute 25.
The attacker of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then turned into the middle of the land and ran to half the land of the Liverpool team.
Kovacic made a quick move of one-two in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who entered the path.
Hazard surpassed the defense and sent the ball into the net, succeeding in hitting it with his left foot and passing by the player Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Naples team at the League of Champions on Wednesday at 15:00 on Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the Videoton team in UEFA Europe League Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the National Disaster Agency, on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped under the ruins of the earthquake of 7.5 which took place on Friday and triggered waves up to 6 metres, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000 people, has been covered by the remains caused by the collapse of the buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of killing a woman through a stab wound.
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The woman, aged 44, was found at 7:55 a.m., with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and was arrested a man suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen something about this subject to come to the section for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I appeal to all those near John Street in Birkenhead who have heard or seen something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful material with the help of the on-board room to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the body belongs to a woman in Birkenhead and that it was found on a property.
This afternoon, a few people came to the crime scene who thought I knew the woman to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigations are under way, and the police said they were trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but he was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building have been told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that now the whole area is considered the crime scene.
On the spot, there was a woman in tears.
“ It’s so terrible again and again. ”
At 2:00 p.m., two dubs of the police were in the perimeter and another one was outside it.
A few police officers stood in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Any person with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC police, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at phone number 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the most recent memorial monument affected by the altercations on "history rewriting"
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many religious and cultural artifacts of England, carried out by its fanatical Puritans.
But Cromwell's society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "insanity" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of states as Oliver Cromwell’s figure from the Westminster Palace to become a target.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would sacrifice himself for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation, this is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
But surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure that is recognizable, which represents a part of this division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated."
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a South West China market, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only after the name of his name "Yuan", was found dead after an artery was sectioned and was covered with blood, near a pig farm located in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday editorial of Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining from Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he had come with his cousin from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby cottage was open.
He said that there was a pig in the bowl with large blood in his mouth.
The forensics confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer’s death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were full of blood and finished," said the cousin, whose last name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed their pigs.
After about an hour, his body was found.
The animal that caused the death of the man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was shut down to stop him from attacking someone else, while the police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and authorities negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs that attacked people have still been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and their husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a pig 300 kg, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and chase the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions."
“They just play.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, who has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwest of the United States
As expected, hurricane Rosa loses its intensity as it moves to cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States in the next days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a category 1 hurricane on Sunday, from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it began to form a depressed area across the Pacific Ocean and is moving east, to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula, Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, he will begin to push intense tropical humidity from the north to the southwest of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity that will interact with the depressed area will generate abundant rains in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, the rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause rapid dangerous flooding, waste flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevade and Arizona.
Precipitation between 5 and 10 cm in the south-west, in particular in the majority of Arizone, is expected.
Rapid floods may occur due to rapid deterioration conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is not recommended that you venture in the desert on foot in view of the threat posed by tropical rain.
The heavy rain could lead to the transformation of canyons into violent rivers, and the storms will bring local winds into ravines and dust.
The nearby depressed area will bring torrential rains to the areas on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of nearly 2 cm is possible, which could lead to minor flows of waste and slippery roads.
These will be the first rainfall in the region, in the wet season.
Sprinkled tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of Sunday and in the first part of Monday, before the rain spreads more Monday evening and Tuesday.
The intense precipitation will spread on so-called "four corners" Tuesday and persist until Wednesday.
In October intense changes will occur in the US, as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic differences in temperature are found at the central U.S. level.
There is a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Within the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to form and expand again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern parts of the United States will face a hot start in October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from south to certain portions in the north-east.
Tuesday, the city of New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high odds of temperatures above average for the U.S. by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people followed the press statement supported by the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, TV stations interrupting the normal Friday program for a last hour news: an agreement concluded between Senator Jeff Flake of the Arizona for the FBI to conduct an indictment investigation for a week.
Ford said in front of the committee that it is 100% sure that Kavanaugh harassed her while she was drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said it's 100% sure this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have followed the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average vision on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems in identifying people who are watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a play-off football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during daily hearings.
ABC was second, with a number of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while the protesters shouted at him and he was trying to get up in an elevator at a hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He looked down for a few minutes while people were fighting him, and everything was broadcast to CNN live.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
“Do you think he tells us the truth?
He was told: “You have power, while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions then broadcast live the vote on the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate's vote.
But Flake said he would do this only if the FBI agreed to consider the charges against the nominee next week, which the minority Democrats called for.
Flake was mostly convinced of conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's choice was important, since the Republicans would obviously not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses criticism of "political games" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses criticism of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Great Britain and submining national interests in an interview for the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Great Britain, attended the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the one accompanied by his photograph on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on his plan for Brexit, so-called the Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect their mutual tariffs was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected he shot the LSU player dead
Police arrested a suspect in the case of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned, being charged with grade 2 murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered their glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, affiliated CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say he admitted that he shot Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Legal Medicine Office published a preliminary report on Friday, saying that death was caused by a head shot through the neck.
The department deserves the Louisiana police force, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police and the citizens in that area for the aid offered in the investigation, which led to the arrest.
Athletic Director LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "diligentity and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker with a height of 1.98 m grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoverys.
Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team is "defeated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano threw a column of ashes over Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano arrived in the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexico on Saturday to keep the distance from the volcano after the crater activity began and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors several hurdles and vibrations.
The images on the social networks presented thin layers of ashes on the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimlico.
Geophysicians observed an increase in the activity of the volcano that is 72 km south-east of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflict between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence protesters clashed with the gendarmii, on the first anniversary of the vote for the secession of Catalonia, gathering thousands of opponents.
A group of masked pro-separatists held away from the Jandarms bombarded them with eggs and powdery paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The fighting intensified later, using the police to control the situation.
For a few hours, the pro-independence groups scanned "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while the Union protestors shouted "Long live Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to the local press.
Tension remains at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the referendum of October 1 was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters, in a large majority, chose to become independent, although participation in the vote was low, and those against the secession boycotted largely the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at the voting centres in the region, with violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped over the night Friday evening to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new way.
Narciss Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hope as regards the acquisition of independence by Catalonia.
“ Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I watched my parents cry for joy that I can vote, but now we have nothing else to do," he said.
Despite a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan pro-independent parties tried to maintain the momentum this year, many of the best known leaders in either exile or detention, waiting for the trial for the role of organizing the referendum and for the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who registered on his phone the police protest, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation becomes increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Many men were arrested after entering a house with their car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car entered a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place on Thursday, about 7:30 p.m., in Ballynegard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage to the ports and even the building was caused.
It seems that at some point, there's been a gunfire on the car.
Menga's shot helped the Livingston team win with 1-0 ahead of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers team with no reply, Steven Gerrard reaching the second defeat in 18 matches, as manager of the Ibriox club.
Dolly Menga's hit turned out to be the difference while Gary Holt's team played the same level as Hibernian in the second round.
Gerrard's team remains without a win on the way to Premier League this season and faces Hearts leaders, being behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to this, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in division until six matches, Holt's main coach still feels the taste of defeat because he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against raw visitors
Holt's team should have moved forward long before they signed up, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through and tried to shake the space at the gates, then Alan Lithgow managed to shake wide after he slipped in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause visitor problems at the free strikes.
And that was how the crucial goal came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston managed an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to pay attention to Menga, who listened and scored from the center of the horse.
At that stage, Rangers dominated the possession, but faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and the carrier Liam Kelly was no longer greatly disturbed in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second round, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't succeed against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgow gave a big shot at another Livingston player.
The diagonal steps continued to come into the home of the Livingston team, but without success, and the two requests for penalties - after Halkett suddened Glenn Middleton and after a locket - were not accepted.
"Fenomnal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland on stadium Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and team have not changed at all since the top comeback, but the merits must be granted to Holt for how he trained his team since taking it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the entire party.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they had good performances since they were driven by Gerrard, they did not reach the same standards.
The empty passes were unsuccessful, they only managed to catch the gate of the free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Joint reactions to Erdogan's visit to Köln
It was all pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin to take breakfast.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany to remedy the relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied because of such problems as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Köln to open a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside Turkey.
The police have invoked security grounds to prevent the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but have gathered enough supporters nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, most Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive him with open arms in the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division in respect of a visitor considered a hero of some of the Turks in Germany and one autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies following collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died on the spot.
The accident takes place just a few months after another biker died following an accident on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the spot, which is about a mile away from the place where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said the officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the route of the buses is diverted, and motorcycles are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Wounded Following a Challenging
Six prison officers were injured following a fight at a high-security prison for men, a prison representative said.
On Sunday, there was a fight at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30, this is being underway.
Specialized officers have been brought to deal with fighting, in which eight prisoners are involved, isolated in a wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “The assistance of prison staff was requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer time after the graces."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the governor of the prison needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last year, in October, the officers dealing with the disturbances were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the personnel being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded because of the Rosa hurricane (the droughtful areas can enjoy benefits as a result of this)
Tropical depression rarely occurs in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the south-western desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western area of Arizone, South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct path to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of the month it will cause precipitation.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix announced in a message on Twitter that only “six tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression over a distance of approximately 320 km from Phoenix in 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action on a distance of about 60 km from the border with Arizona."
The latest models of the National Centre for Urbane forecast precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including in the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, there will be recorded quantities between 3 and 5 cm, with total possible quantities of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, in some areas the torrential rain will be beneficial, as the south-west faces drought problems.
According to the United States Secate Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona faces at least one severe drought, and the second largest category", information found onweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north, 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected that it will produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, at a high flood risk.
"The torrential rains between 8 and 10 cm are expected from Baja California to the north-west of Sonora, and can also reach 25 cm", according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the morning of Tuesday, as tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger represented by Rosa or his remains is extreme torrential rain in Baja California, north-western Sonora and the desert in the south-west of the United States," said a representative of the National Centre for Urbane.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger people's lives, and will bring waste streams to waste, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20 - year - old man were arrested as a result of a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16 - year - old person was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, about 4:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he's in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-olds were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The officers requested the help of citizens who might have materials on their mobile phone, respectively, to appear at the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced the Democratic Party's "disgrace and anger"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactic of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also stated that Kavanaugh faced the "disgrace and anger" of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress, strongly denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims about harassing her sex ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting about her statement.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw on that day Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage."
"A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best legal minds of this generation," he told many West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the republican presence in the interim elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but in a way, I'm running," he said.
“For this reason, I express my positive opinion all over about candidates whom I consider to be great.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate from Kavanaugh's nomination will take place no later than Friday, a assistant of the GOP management for CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, with increasing numbers
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by huge waves that hit the beaches, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach in the middle, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their way.
The Tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, thus becoming victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, at a press conference in Jakarta.
“Tsunami brought cars, bushes, houses, hitting everything on the land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled widely at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to climb the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency present several buildings and shops destroyed, overturned and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the appeals continued to shake the town on the coast.
The earthquake series has been felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Indonesia said that the energy emitted by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima of the Second World War.
Perhaps the geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow golf course, intensified the magnitude of the tsunami, added the representative.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing persons.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be larger along the 300 km coast north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely disrupted, without any information," said Nugroho.
There live more than 300,000 people," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the Agency was severely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami would strike Palu, although the authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In posts on social networks, a man on the upper floor of a building may be heard shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the truth of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major disruption of electricity, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The army began sending aided cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people still need food and other basic things.
The city's airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centers of Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are placed in improvised shelters in the backyard of the office, they went by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Although aid groups have begun to launch aid actions in the event of disaster, some people have complained that comprehensive foreign workers have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesia's regulations, financial resources, materials and personnel can reach the place of production of a disaster only if declared national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster in the province,” Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia, said.
“After what the government will say, “Yes, this is a national disaster”, we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has yet been announced.”
After the second night of the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday in Palu, the missing friends and families hoped that the loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescue personnel released a woman who had been under the ruins of two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other people in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"In view of the experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon reported how, within a few hours of the broadcast of news about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the community of paragliding sports practitioners, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to the Palu contestants who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But only a gray bead appeared on the right of his messages, and not two blue beads.
"I think that means the messages haven't been transmitted," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 during the delivery of a Newport on the Levee ATM
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who feeds a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied a ATM from the entertainment complex and prepared to transport more money, wrote Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man “got behind Brink's back ” and stole a bag of money that had to be transported.
According to the notice, the witnesses observed more suspects who fled from the scene, but the police did not mention the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport police at phone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his stage name to "Ye"
The Kanye West rapper changes his stage name to "Ye".
He announced on Saturday the change on Twitter: "the individual officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41 years old, is called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of the album's eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before it appears at the Saturday Night Live show, where it is expected to launch its new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled "for reasons of emotional nature", said the producer of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation for the current stage name, West previously said that this word also has a religious significance for him.
“I believe that “ye” is the most frequently encountered word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said earlier this year, in the conversation on the title of the Big Boy Radio Host album.
“So it’s you, it’s me, it’s about us.
It all started from "Kanye", which means the only one, and it came to "Ye", which is a reflection of our good, evil, unclear and of the whole.
The album is more a reflection of what we are as people."
He is one of the most rappers who have chosen to change his stage name.
Sean Combs had numerous stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has changed his name, sometimes with chromium, sometimes without, and sometimes with great letters.
President of Mexico promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, as the country near the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to punish the Mexican people."
The troops fired at a peaceful market demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left movement of students was rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has undertaken to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for AI
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and the users of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after more members of the U.S. government have made announcements about AI, even though an official artificial intelligence strategy is missing in the US.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be first with regard to AI innovation by 2030.
"Dubling the IA research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next AI discovery," Lee said.
Double funding could double the chance that the next major achievement in the IA field would be made in the US, Lee said for CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "IA Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated American player Othello, the best in the field at the time, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research and President of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated the previous competitions of American governments in the field of technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency's advanced defence research projects, and asked when it would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States must often work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
"Not China puts academic leaders on wheels, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired remarkable graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to intensify its efforts by AI.
"I think it should automatically offer visas to doctors in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued a New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the Research Institute of the U.S. Army (DARPA) announced an investment worth $2 billion for an initiative called the Next AI.
NSF also currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, no changes have occurred in the legislation of the United States with the aim of setting up a Commission for National Security in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote on the referendum if they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they want the country's name to be changed in the "North Macedonia Republic", a change that would resolve a dispute for a decade with Greece, opposing its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June with regard to the new name proposed, but opposing nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign was doubtful as to the presence of the vote, and that the minimum limit of 50%, required for the validation of the referendum, could not be reached.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: "Do you agree with EU and NATO accession, accepting the agreement with Greece?"
The name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the spread of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia will live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska said, 79 years old, in Skopje.
While not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive.
In order for the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum is required in parliament.
The state's electoral commission stated that there were no irregularities reported by 13:00.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the people with voting rights were put to the vote.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje, the country's capital.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on the change of Macedonia's name, which will allow him to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small-scale scene and laid chairs in front of the high tents of those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the top, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can move to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO will bring so much needed investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that most will be in favour of changing names, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after he voted.
He said that a result in favour of changing the name would be “confirming our future”.
According to a poll published last month by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-vestic government policy since the government took over last May.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to cross the entire Brighton team defense and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass the Brighton team's defense and wins the Manchester City team on Saturday with 2-0 on the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed like Aguero was incredibly easy to score in the minute 65.
The Argentine attacker received a step in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among three defensive players from Brighton, before he got to the free side of the land.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four opposing team players.
He managed to get past a security guard, and then he passed more true players on the edge of the Brighton team.
After that, he took a step to the left, the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English attacker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, succeeding in avoiding the doorman at Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a whistle to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero is facing a few problems at his feet," said reporters Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City.
“I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he signed a goal at that time."
But Sterling is the one who got them the initial advantage for the Azuri in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep step on Brighton's territory at that stage.
Then he gave a hand on Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane pulled the balloon a few times until she sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it in the direction of the gates.
The Azurian attacker hit the balloon to the net right before he headed out of the field.
Manchester City will meet on Tuesday at 12:55, with Hoffenheim in the group phase, on Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to hurt the game against Rockies
With the national team removed from the play-off competition, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win on Sunday in the game against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still implications in play-off for Rockies, which hold an advantage with a game facing the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies got at least an unpredictable place, with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday, but they still try to keep their first title of division.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here, in Denver, alongside many, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but, according to sources, it is inclined to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening shot of the match number 34, had a heating session Thursday and would throw it under normal conditions this Sunday.
The middleman in Washington has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2,53 and 300 at 220 and 2/3 matches this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation concerning a decision by the Supreme Court concerning Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the republican presence at the intermediate elections.
“All our effort is at stake in November.
There are five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the great ones, I don't run, but in fact I run, that's why I try out of power to support good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “See this terrible, radical group of Democrats, see what happens right now.
And they are determined to take power again by using any means necessary, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to crush to get power and control, that they want, to have power and control, and we won't."
He also said that Democrats are on a mission of "resistence and obstruction".
"And you can see that in the last four days," he also said, describing the Democrats as "wrong and evil, gross and liars."
He referred to the senate of the Democratic Party's Dianne Feinstein, who was a member of the Senate's Judiciary Committee, which was strongly dismissed by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you disclose the document?
What?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people from a different point of view.
Persons expressing their opinion are no longer tolerated
I was not surprised at the fact that Momentum activists from my local party supported the motion of censure with regard to me.
After all, I'm just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who were told they weren't welcome, just because we expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received a similar treatment because she was vehement in anti-semitism.
As far as I am concerned, the motion of censure was critical to my address because I disagreed with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, concerning which Jeremy neither shared his views with the previous leaders.
The communication for the Friday session in Nottingham East of the Labour Party mentioned that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evenings were so.
Unfortunately, many meetings today do not take place in this way, and the promise of a "better, milder" political environment has been forgotten for a long time, if ever respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party's leadership.
Things started to be like this when Jeremy became the leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom we had a common vision of politics began to expect to change my thinking and agree with some things that I would not have agreed with before, including national security or the single EU market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuse on the dissociation networks that demand my elimination from the party, exposing the central policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person to face this.
Indeed, I know I'm luckier than my colleagues, because the comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but they maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with every motion for censorship or change of the rules of selection, the party becomes less and less flexible about this aspect.
Many people have advised me over the past two years to put my head down, not to be so vocal anymore, and everything will be "good" like that.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the negligence that the Thatcher government has shown, led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who have the greatest need for them, as a local adviser or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including at the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues I disagree with in relation to the current leadership are unclear to him.
People who have supported the motion on Friday can only tell them that, in the context that the country is headed to Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and promise you that no threat of elimination of party or political opportunism will stop me from taking the decisions I consider in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team arrives in top rankings
Despite the fact that two late trials have somehow influenced the final outcome, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's extremely interactive game from Tennent's Premiership.
It's now in the top of the ranking, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
In the end, everything was summed up in their better defenses, as well as the fact that they took advantage of the chances they had, which helped the host team and thanked Coach Peter Murchie.
“We have been subjected to several tests during our games so far and we continue to be undefeated, so I must be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie de la Melrose said: “The merit is given to the Ayr team, they took advantage of more chances than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt of the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave him an advantage of the Ayr team, but a yellow card received by the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who could join the team, playing at Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformed attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, right at the middle of the game, managed to sign up, and then managed to turn an individual test, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started the second recovery very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was pulled out of the field with the targa, and from the start of the game, Ayr disbanded through the attempt of Stafford McDowall, transformed by Clima.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the spare player pay with an untransacted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a severe pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he plated Climo without ball, MacPherson managed to score, offering him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo turned the test, as he did again near the re-start of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" movement and sent extreme Gregor Henry into the deep for the fifth attempt of the host team.
Website View "Stil Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the sitcom star "Stil Game", seems ready to move to the hospitality industry after finding out he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis' role in the BBC's beloved show, writing his script and playing alongside his long-standing partner, the comedy actor Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the next series, the number nine, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, he is the director of the Adriftmorn Limited company.
The actor refused to comment on this news, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to be involved in "the restaurant development industry".
"The Great Is Ours": Bolivia island hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings hang the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered by the motto: “The sea is ours in law.
We have to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which does not come out at sea, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a bloody conflict of the resources of the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in the past decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the necessary appetite, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the outcome with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of strong discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – facing a controversial battle for the re-emergence of the next year – also has much to gain from the decision of Monday .
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that too few things would change if it happened.
The United Nations body within the Netherlands does not have the power to grant territory belonging to Chile and has concluded that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after hearing the final pleas, indicates that this case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
And not only that Bolivia has not been successful in cause, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea was hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after that.
The two countries did not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia to the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making process of the court was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia an “extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “put an end to 139 years of mutual disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past.”
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if he couldn't trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to abide by the promises made during a summit at Singapore, with the leaders of the rivals.
His comments come in the context where US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume diplomatic actions on nuclear threat after more than three months since the meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it is an "unreal vision" as the continued sanctions and the objection of the United States with regard to the declaration of the end of the Korean war to ever cause the territory of the north to fall.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the statement without first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not think that Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers to be the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will soon be available in stores
If you're looking for hats to extend your collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
Fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at the Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
The practical hats have won the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion creators have sent the creations that steal eyes on the podium.
The piece of resistance of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant, bej-coloured hat, with a broad bud, similar to a penis, in which the heads of the models were sunk.
Other oversized accessories have included beads bent with margins, a ware hat and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head against the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had stitched lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and did not fashion high sewing.
One of the creatures seemed to be a diving equipment, having a oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be an ice-cold cone.
And if you want to keep adopting such a dress style, with oversized clothing articles, you're lucky.
Stilists are planning a return of huge bonnets in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats come back after the appearance of the "La Bomba" hat with a wide sponge, seen to everyone, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the hat at all practical that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, respectively, of straw stock for the beach, with a size as large as the model in the bathroom that wears it.
The orange bag of rafia, with rafia fringes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of the spring-summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" of Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week
The star stylist, Luke Armitage, said for FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing hats and oversized beach folk in luxury shops in the next summer, because the fashion designer has had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record on academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results at the examination, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are working to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high and high school education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of the competition this year, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools have shown that 72% of students have obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish have obtained such a certificate.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, like matter, are kept as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other areas.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for the reasons that employers had given them to fight for vacancies, 17% had been attributed to a lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills increasingly become imperative for preparing young people for their future career.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a ability throughout life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to carry a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percent of two digits, 15%.
It is therefore important for children today to invest in learning foreign languages.
With more languages, especially in developing countries, children will have greater chances of finding significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, such as mandarina or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be more than one language of choice in independent schools, with teaching frameworks that specialize in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills needed to succeed, however the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.

LeBron will make his debut at Lakers Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is almost the end for fans who want to see LeBron James how he starts for Los Angeles Lakers.
The coach of Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in the opening of Sunday's prison against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes will he play still remain to settle.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James would probably play short minutes.
Following training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game Lakers programme in the press.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need games in the press to get ready,” he said.
Trump's election rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins this evening a series of campaigning matches in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five matches scheduled next week, which include stops in places where the electorate is favorable, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for the candidate chosen for his free place from the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for future elections from mid-term because the Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's election rally take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I track him online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00, East Coast time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election rally online in West Virginia via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss this week's Brett Kavanaugh hearing, a candidate for the Supreme Court, a hearing that has become tense because of allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, so the FBI can investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of matches is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain a little land.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign said that the role of these five matches next week is “energizing volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for its programme that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season," said Reuters, a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be named.
Scheduled to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's rally could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the media in Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won the elections at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is being conducted in polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder 2018 Cup: U.S. team gives evidence of determination and continues to fight to maintain the chance for simple samples starting on Sunday
After three clear-dominated sessions, it's possible that the foursome test Saturday afternoon was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The always oscillating pendulum of motivation is an invented concept for the sports world, but players even believe in it, all the more in the case of competitions like this.
So, where is their motivation now?
"They were driving us six points, now the difference is only four points, so we rely on this decrease for a bit of motivation," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point advance, when there are twelve more points in the game.
Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are enough reasons for encouragement, of which the most important is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won every three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green area with lethal precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those bellows of the celebration became increasingly loud as the advance round, especially when it entered a crucial point by which the score was returned to equality in the fourth game, after he and Thomas were driven two points after the first two holes.
The hit that won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think that the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to focus and worry only about your own game," Spieth says.
That's all these players left.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe won four out of four games and it seems I can't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that did not need any additional hit Saturday afternoon, but this statement is also valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the nine Friday mornings.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic public reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would eventually lead to a potential victory of the Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different holes.
Discussions about the glory of Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs test, when he made a pair with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles at the first nine holes sank Spanish and Swedish into a pit so deep that they weren't even close to coming out of it.
Sunday, though, no one will be safe.
Fourballs and foursomes tests are fascinating and deserve close attention due to the interactions between pairs, the advices given and the way a strategy can be changed on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after the four-balls and four-to-saturday four-to-saturday matches with an advantage of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired pair composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two winners in front of an exciting Tiger Woods, which has increased their score from so far to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes at the fourball test in the morning and won the series with score 3 to 1.
The US has opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome test, where it won two matches, but it has not been able to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 simple games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and along with Molinari, a pair called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair that wins four points of the four opening matches throughout the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs test, they superbly supported themselves to defeat the discouraged Woods and the American novice Bryson Dechambeau with a score even clearer, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two games on Saturday, had occasional genius eclipses, but so far has lost 19 of the 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, of which seven were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourball session, returned with her partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome test and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe did not, however, have a journey without obstacles on this pleasant and cool day in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the standard for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win by 2-1 a game against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and then they came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 to 3 in four four-and-three four-and-a-half four-and-a-half four-and-a-half four-and-a-half four-and-a-half four-and-a-half four-and-a-half four-th four-and-a-half four-and-a-th-th-bund-th-buck for the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has managed a team to recover a four-point deficit in the simple samples, though, because they are current trophies owners, Furyk players only need an equal result.
However, after being in the second two days in a row, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea states that there is no "no chance" to disarm unilaterally as long as there is no trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday the United Nations that the extension of the sanctions would deepen the lack of confidence in the United States and that it was impossible for its country to unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Annual Assembly of the Global Council that in North Korea "significant measures have been implemented to prove good faith" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and rocket testing, dismounting the nuclear testing site and undertaking non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we see no adequate response from the U.S.,” he said.
"If we can't trust the US, we won't trust our national security capabilities and, under such circumstances, we can't disarm the first unilateral."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's family objections to Washington's opposite resistance to a "extended" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it would step by step, its statement seemed significant because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearisation directly, as did the Phenian in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a premiere summit between a US-led president and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to make progress towards a "declaration of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea sought an official end to the Korean War of 1950-1953, but the United States stated that the Phenian must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not submitted requests for the relaxation of the harsh international sanctions imposed by North Korea.
"SUA insists on the "first denuclearization" option and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even objecting against "war termination declaration," Ri said.
“The impression that the sanctions can bow to us is an illusion that only people who do not know us.
The problem, though, is that the sanctions extended further to our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, referred to by the US leader in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korea's president, over the past five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this level."
Even under these circumstances, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he said for the UN General Assembly that it is inevitable to target North Korea's U.S. missile territory after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocheted man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened North Korea last year with “total destruction”, praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but pointed out that the work just started and that the sanctions will remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there is no planned time for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it lasts two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say that the Phenian should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday for the UN Security Council: “The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without interruption until we get complete, final and confirmed denuclearisation.”
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions imposed by North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block the funds for nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Phenian.
Pompeo met with Ri in the colors of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit the Phenian again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have too good results.
When he left Phenian in July, he said that progress had been made, but only a few hours later North Korea denounced that he had made “gangsterist threats”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has undertaken to dismantle a rocket launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures”.
He said that Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” that he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat growing macho culture that makes them subject to “all night” learning sessions, powered by a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that, often, students at the world’s most prestigious universities do not even have the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this guy in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of sleeplessness on the ability to learn.
“In the end, a girl came and said to me, ‘Why is this just now, in the last year?’
She told me she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said for The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance as well as the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after he discovered that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hourly course may involve a number of interactive tasks.
Within a section is presented the image of a room of home, and students can click on coffee meat, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by the lack of sleep, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
“We know we can’t change the behavior of students instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking are on health," added Professor Czeisler.
Culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed by students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain believe that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course, after participating in one of his first years at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar curriculum of studies before joining this institution where the competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for waking hours, and to know what the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal takes down Gerard's team
Rangers suffer from another case of depression on the way because Dolly Menga's strike sentenced Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team on Ibox wanted to win the first victory on the move from the 4-1 triumph in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as a coach, which puts Rangers eight points behind Hearts, the authoritative leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga signed up seven minutes before the break and the uninspired players from the Rangers did not appear at any time able to equal it.
Rangers thus fell on the sixth position in the ranking, while Livingston went up the third place, behind Hibernian, to a single goal difference.
And Rangers might also face other problems, because the Calim Spence cough umpire had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, apparently, thrown from the fan lawn of the visiting team.
Gerrard changed eight players from the lot that won easy against Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 Livingstone players who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has all the reasons to be proud of how his well-trained lot suffocated his opponents throughout the game.
Even though Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored just two minutes after the game started, when Menga's first step pushed Scott Pittman to the gate defended by Allan McGregor, but the middle missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free shot by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
Rangers took over, but left the impression that they hope more than they trust their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he met Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but Arbitrator Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
Rangers only managed two hits on the gate in the first stop, but the former porter on Ibox, Liam Kelly, was not at all disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or by Ovie Ejaria's weak strike.
Although the 34th minute goal of Livingstone did not respect the tendency of the game, no one can deny that it was worth it either for the effort put forward.
Again, Rangers have failed to prevent a deep center of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ball, which kept his calm and fed Menga, the one who finished with a simple shot.
Gerrard acted at pause, when he changed Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this movement almost paid off immediately, when extreme centred Morelos, but impressive Kelly came out of buttons to block it.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors in exactly the same type of match he prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting after the center.
Holt's team could have extended their advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs's hit, and then Lithgow sent his head to the corner gate.
Glenn Middleton, reserved at Rangers, asked for a penalty at the end of the game, when he hit Jacobs, but again Thomson disagreed.
Almanah: Creator of Count Geiger
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the continuum count...), is the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, Count Geiger has become essential for pop culture, as happened in the film "The Clopots of San Coronado" (1950), where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played in the role of cowboys with unlikely science tendencies:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these crates, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Yes, a lot of punches are heard.”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them into a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and are then reinjected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them into the laboratory so that they can "detect" a common protein of many cancers, called HER2, then reinjection of cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have to deal with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "determines the increase of many types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to remove immune cells from patients and to "learn" them to target cancer cells, also worked for the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a Tromp’s supportive dialogy, while wearing a MAGA cap, after the emergence of SNL.
It didn't come out too well
Kanye West was tried at the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after an undisturbed show praising US president Donald Trump and said he was planning to run for the 2020 elections.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Cape Make America Great, the artist broke out in a speech against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump?’
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began with a scene playing Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual assault charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcasted, West Diat film was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take West over with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems in the backseat because of his hedge.
“They tried to intimidate me behind the scenes.
They said, "You don't wear this cap."
I've been assaulted!
They also told me we got very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see how far down we have?", then he said, “I’ll get Superman’s coat, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try with love."
His comments attracted public fugitives at least twice, and members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; a person on this team said to the publication: “The studio has gained complete silence.”
West was invited as the last hour substitute for the soloist Ariana Grande, whose beloved rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West picked up a lot of snacks when he played the song I Love it dressed like a glass of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits among us: Thank you for running the bullet."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West, simply, "was himself and that's wonderful."
"I still choose not to reward someone (buying his music or dress or supporting his "art") about which I think he embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, announcing that from now on it is "the officially known being as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name; West is following Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known as Prince".
Accusation of attempted murder for a stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant on the east side of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defence lawyer is expected to be in front of the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the Star of Throne Urzeal, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for Jon Snow's role in the series of violent medieval fantasy The Body of Thrones, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on the screen makes the boys think it must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that it seems to him that "something wrong happened" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #Metoo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague from the Urzelala Tronulus, Rose Leslie, who is still 31 years old, acknowledged that she is "very determined" to talk about this problem.
"Personal, I am very determined to talk about it now: where have I been wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we taught men about how to be adults, given the problem we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing the toxicity masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What does the young boys teach on TV and on the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the great questions of our times: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something wrong with young people happened."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not play in any kind of series based on the Body of Thrones after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying that “it ended with battlefields and horses.”
Since November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West Theatre by Sam Shepard, which presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thug.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him because of the series The Throne Urzeal is that he knew his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife when I made this series, so it assured me the future of my family and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the winning fantasy series of several Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, they say officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike those of the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was almost zero, says the Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From one year to another, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual HIV transmission is a acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered very widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, the studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many cases of transmission of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to drugs against HIV as part of the effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has released Senators' data from the Republican Party, talks about "dangerous beginnings" and "the theories of conspiracy"
The representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team posted personal information about three Republican Senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges are made by analysts and "right extreme" websites.
"Minds, lies and other nasty lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
The published information included the Senators' personal addresses and phone numbers. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of improper sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as judge in the Supreme Court.
The information leak took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and presented the information to a member of Waters' team, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“Member of the team, whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, has in no way been responsible for the leaking of such information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he does not have the necessary temperament to be a Member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
They shall not question the accuser's motivation.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticised by Democrats, who said he looked a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in mid-term elections, also commented on Twitter.
“ Of course, if it is true, ” he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office alerted “the appropriate legal authorities and entities to these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered,” she continued, “and that they will respond to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members.”
Review Johnny English hits again: homeless parody of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition of looking for the associated meanings of Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the series of parodys of action films that has as its main character Johnny English, the series that started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English returns.
Could this defiant satire of how strange we are to become the new opportunity to export the nation?
Johnny English's incompetent eye spy and rubber face, has been renewed for the second time the license to ruin everything. The name of the character means, firstly, that it is a general comic creation for the cinematographic audience of the English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the scrupulous secret agent who, despite his pretensions to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop by Mr. Bean and a knife tip of that type that contributed with one note to the music theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
The character is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without a country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard commercials for TV, who left chaos behind.
This latest adventure of JE also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor pallets hit his helmet easily.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is quite weak and, strangely, superfluous, especially because movies "serious", such as those in the 007 series or impossible Mission, confidently provide comical moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to address children more than adults and, for me, Johnny English's exciting adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's silent movie gags when he plays Bean's role.
As usual, the premise always is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the supersecret web network of Great Britain spies and revealed the identities of English agents undercover, towards the despair of the service agent, a regrettable role of small for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who is under siege, who is already suffering a serious crisis due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can with his similar character Theresa May, but the scenario does not give him the chance to shine.
His secret intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so they need to activate an agent in reserve.
This is Johnny English's own zevjet, now working as a teacher at a high-class school, which gives lessons on how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute holes, because English runs a spy academy in the style of School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency meeting, then is reunited with his old partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little wasted.
So, these Batman and Robin of the creation of the messes in the Secret Service of His Majesty are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a billionaire charismatic of the technological industry that claims he can solve the IT problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start in an odyssey of bourgeois adventures: dressed in waiters, set a French fashion restaurant on fire, create chaos when they slip on board Volta's luxury ship, then English triggers clean-shaped anarchies when they try to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colorful the film, it seems to be a television production for children.
A pretty mediocre film.
As in the case of the other films with Johnny English, I can't stop asking myself, can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role to his talent?
Laborers deny that they have in mind the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the heads of companies to take advantage of the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) giving the employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have changed.
Sources say that the idea would be "opposed" with the party's economic programme, which wants to tilt balance in favour of workers.
The four-day work week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way by which workers can benefit from changing the economy.
A source from the Labour Party’s leadership said for The Sunday Times: “The announcement on a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a suitable aspiration to address the trade-rebaling party in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall strategy of the industry party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party's 2017 campaign promises for general elections.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The week of work for four days is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.”
The Chancellor Lord of the Shadow Cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said it is determined to take back the power from the "faceless directors" and "profiters" from the utility companies.
The plans of the Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water-provided regions may not recover their actions in full, because the Labour Government could receive "deductions" because of alleged offences.
It also confirmed plans to appoint employees in companies’ boards and to create ownership funds to give up 10% of the private sector’s own capital to employees, which will thus receive annual dividends up to about 500 lire.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy revealed in the "60 Minutes" show if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh would make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought to Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court with at least a week's notice and raised the question whether Republican senators might be convinced to stop supporting him because of the FBI's findings.
In a broadcasted interview on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I said this at the beginning of the hearing; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, soon, without error."
Graham's vote, however, seems dug in the rock.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so he would need some explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that: Brett firmly rejects the charges," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“ None of the people named by her confirmed the story.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens' Festival, an annual musical event in which an impressive group of stars will participate, with an equally impressive mission: the elimination of world poverty.
Up to the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park lawn, not only to pursue artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the true goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who fight actively against it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (except where they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to pay for a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making telephone calls or other significant things that help increase awareness of the goal of eliminating global poverty.
But what was the success of the Global Citizens' Festival when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism", a concept that refers to people who feel they have done something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, in 2011 more than 19 million “actions” were recorded by its supporters, which promoted different objectives.
The organization says these actions have spurred world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in the account of which at least $10 billion had already been spent or closed.
The group estimates that the insured funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with headquarters in the United Kingdom of investors and intermediaries who have committed to "help children grow to their full potential", which has promised to offer Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 messages on Twitter from global citizens.
"With the help of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition only become a footnote in the history book," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund the The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer for one of the most frequent questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who will play this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use naval forces for a "block" that will make Russia's energy exports more difficult, says the Secretary of Interior
Washington may, "if necessary", call on naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, revealed U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to intermediate energy sales, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and ways to manage the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not come out on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization declaring itself "the voice of the consumer of energy" in the USA.
It continued to compare how Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is basically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying about Russia, "it's one trick" because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
Declarations come at a time when Trump administration is trying to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump's representatives, including President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unsuited" project of the North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a Moscow "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline, 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin said that US fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we're looking at things the same way: energy cannot be a pressure instrument and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Aleksandr Novak, Russian Energy Minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary for Energy in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state intervenes in our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks seriously" to run for the presidential elections of 2020," says the senator in Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday that he had to "think seriously" if he was to run for presidential election after the mid-term election.
During a meeting at the City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that's what a powerful woman needs," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider running the presidential elections."
Warren had something to say and about President Donald Trump during the meeting at the city hall, saying that he “turned the country in the wrong direction”.
"I'm deeply worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate appointed by him for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Twitter Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that no majority of Warren's voters believe they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such an application.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% are against it.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, he reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the posttraumatic stress syndrome that Track Palin is suffering at a Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case
“The things that my own son is going through, through which he has gone back... can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of posttraumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the injuries that our soldiers return with,” Donald Trump told the public gathered at a rally of support to Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other veterans "returned a little different, harder, wondering if there was any respect for what they and their soldiers from the armed and air forces, as well as all other members of the Army, did for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence and holding a firearm in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Columbia District contests a new asylum demand policy
Eighteen states and Columbia District support a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims trying to escape violence caused by gangs or domestic violence.
18-State and District representatives completed a friendly request in Washington on Friday to support a challenge to asylum policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
This said that her partner “and his violent sons, members of a gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyer named Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced a large number of asylum seekers in the United States as nations facing a widespread problem with the domestic gangs and violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled a 2014 decision of the Council for Immigrant Appeals which allowed immigrants without acts to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
“The federal law states that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such a limitation violates this principle,” writes friendly curiae.
In addition, lawyers argue in demand that the policy that refuses the entry of immigrants affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "supply the necessary workforce".
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, in June, ordered judges for immigration cases to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape abuse and violence of the gangs.
“The asylum is granted to those who leave the country motivated by persecution or fear because of racial discrimination, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said on 11 June when he announced the policy.
The role of asylum has never been that of solving all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a race against timer to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is giving birth to her baby suffering from fever at an evacuation center in the city destroyed Palu.
“The babies bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient."
The residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude earthquake of 7.5 on Richter scale, were out of the picture.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous replications.
He has eyes full of tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“ We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris said for the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and to my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "abuse" of "paganda claims"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper praising the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda material.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to China's supplement paid in Des Moines Register, best sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of mixing in the 6 November elections for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what US officials said to Reuters that it is a new phase in a Washington escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war, involving waves of import tariff increases.
The rates imposed by China as revenge, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, experts from China and the United States said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and business people.
In an editorial published on Sunday in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
"When propaganda spreads through the publication of a commercial in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of free speech and free press in America," says Branstad.
“On the other hand, in the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of the dissidents and you will see no real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese citizens have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say what the paper was about.
Republicans alienate female voters before mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh scandal, warn analysts
As many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, several sexual abuse charges, analysts warned that there would be a counter-reaction, especially from women, during future mid-term elections.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely powerful, and most of the Republicans who have discussed it publicly intend to continue the vote.
"So reactions will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (Arison's representative) final moment initiative on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not look in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesperson of the progressive group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors scanned "Come November!" while demonstrating in the Senate halls when Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite testimony Dr. Christine Blasey Ford reported Mic.
"Enthusiasm and the motivation of Democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the undesired female voters of the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years of age, who, although they do not appeal to the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the sexual abuse charges brought to the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that he might follow a counter-reaction if the Republicans continued the confirmation process.
"This has become a mess for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the vote on the committee or the final vote or the possibility that Kavanaugh will be confirmed, but also how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the USA Priorities, an electoral support group of Democrats, for the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part that they should believe in after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more they seem to believe it later.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe Ford's testimony is likely to be true, while 35% said they strongly believe it or it's likely that Kavanaugh's testimony will be true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's accusations, as well as at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore to the Senate's Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh abused her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that his nomination to the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs to her when he was attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrut, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt is "global dominance".
"Now we have to do it," he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data archive" or PODs.
It may contain lists of contacts, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser, all of a sudden.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has full control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this ‘personal consolidation by data’.
According to the CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrut contributes with adequate resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely messed up at once.
"We do not ask for permission."
In a post published on the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "The Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even after Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergy who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War is celebrated
The only clergy of the Anglican Church who won a Victoria Cross medal as a fighter in the First World War was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had been awarded the highest military honor of Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandsons during the Rushden parade, Northamptonshire.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said it was “a symbolic handful” that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Saint-Quentin Canal "to take a very heavy fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the line first and, with "a fantastic bravery", opened the soldier's path, then alone attacked a artillery nest and managed to eliminate three weapons from the detachment.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years of age, said that his grandfather's actions were “a thing I know I will never be able to equal, but that makes me feel indebted.”
This, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given to many people."
The MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, but they got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you stayed awake all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you could not follow the main event.
The program of the San Jose event contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and had to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, British spectators were amazed when the transmission was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were at all unthankful, because they stayed awake all night to watch the fight.
One fan described Twitter as moving to the cartoon for children as "a kind of bad joke."
“Governmental regulations say that this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Porcupine, yes."
Scott Coker, Bellator's president, said that in the future, they'll be programmed so that their events can also be followed by spectators from the UK.
“When I think about replays, I think we could probably work it out,” Coker said.
"But it's six a.m. on a Sunday day here and we won't be able to do this until Sunday, our time, or months, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen again next time.
We will sum up to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give fans more and we crossed the line.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" because of sexuality
Olympic scumbag Tom Daley says he grew up feeling he was inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
24-year-old sportsman said he only realized when he got to school that "not everyone is like me."
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4, he said he talks about the rights of gay people to give them "hope".
The sportsman also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the traditional show, will be missing a few months due to a disease.
Invited in the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "lower" to others because "it was socially unacceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To date, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different were the real things that gave me the strength and strength to gain success."
He wanted to prove himself “someone, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics became a renowned champion of the LGBT campaigns and took advantage of the emergence of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on many countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live free, without pursuit, and because he wanted to give to others "hope".
The world champion triple said it was “surprisingly caught up” by the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year to the winning filmmaker of Oscar, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14, and his father died of cancer after three years," he said, "it's hard to find someone of the same age who had gone through the same good and bad times.
The two became, in June, the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, says Daley, changed his “whole perspective”.
“If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if he had received tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you won’t be first, Dad’,” he said.
“I would hold him by his hand when he stopped breathing and just after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of a whole life, to jump in front of my country’s spectators at the Olympic Games, there is no more beautiful feeling,” he said.
This inspired him also in the chosen music, Proud of Heather Small, songs that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excited him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Micchelson, out of shape, was passed to the reserve bank on Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Miccelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in forty-seventh game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to return to a good shape so that this is not an unfortunate occasion.
Miccelson, who plays in the biennial event to twelve, another record, was passed on to the reserve bank of Captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has often been for the United States team, the win-win of major tournaments split the day between being major for teammates and exerting their blows, hoping that it will correct what it did wrong.
The 48-year-old player never had the fairest drives, not even in the best time of his career, so it's not the best choice for the narrow terrain of Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish the wrong hits.
And if the land isn't a big enough challenge, in the ninth Mickelson Sunday game will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who has allied himself with the novice Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Miccelson's match could prove absolutely crucial for Americans, led four points at the entrance to the 12 simple matches, which must begin forcefully at this stage.
Furyk was confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't say anything else anyway.
“He fully understood the role he had today, beat me on his shoulder, hugged me, and told me he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened, and that's how I thought we had to proceed.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Miccelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never rose to his personal record.
Miccelson has 18 winning matches, 20 lost and seven half, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
“It’s funny, it’s sarcastic, smart, he likes to joke with players, he’s a wonderful guy in the team locker,” he explained.
“I think young players are having fun with him, it was fun to see him do this during the week.
Its role is more important, not just to play."
Captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows the considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple samples in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a uncomfortable journey.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 Valderrama game, when the team led by Captain Seven Ballesteros led the Americans five points, but only if he managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
“I remind myself that we had a considerable advance at Valderrama; we had a great advance and at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win,” Bjorn said (in a picture) after he followed as the 2018 team, who won with 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now leads with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
“So, history shows me, me and my team, that it is not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play full-time.
Let's get out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are passed on the table.
We have a purpose and this is to win this trophy, it has to remain the goal.
We always said, we have to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we know and what we expect on the other side: the best players in the world."
Eager to see how his players managed on a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow is quite another situation.
Tomorrow, individual performance is important, and this is different.
It's wonderful to be on the field with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to maximum, as a golfer.
This is the message that you have to transmit to players, that must be in the best form tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as I can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play better at the simple test than they did with partners except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing one when Europe managed the "miracle of Medina".
"Remember every word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, succeeded in encouraging his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, as at Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, put a lot of pressure on those mid-games.
We created the proper lot and ordered the players as we wanted, you know, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was drawn to lead the fight: he will face Rory McIllroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
“I chose this group of players in this order, because I think it covers all the subjects,” Bjorn said about the lot for simple proof.
The new German warship, postponed again
The latest fleet of German naval forces should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the old war vessels in the Cold War, but this will only happen in the year, due to defective systems and increasing costs, the local press reported.
The entry into service of the Rheinland-Pfalz ship, the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, who reads a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to be introduced into maritime forces in 2014, but problems arising after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Military Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is assumed that they will be provided with a strong cannon, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas missiles, as well as with stealth technologies, which provide a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to be able to go on missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, the continued delays mean that these last generation war vessels, which they say will increase the maritime force of Germany, will already be aged before they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
F125 frigate gymnast was discussed last year when the German Military Navy officially refused to take over the boat and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Military Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Not much information is available on the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware" defects that would have made the warship useless in a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews of the oldest frigates in the Bremen class.
In addition, it was found that the vessel was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the capacity of the Military Navy to add future facilities.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton “Rheinland-Pfalz” is twice as hard as the German vessels used in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective mechanisms, and the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached the amazing figure of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the original price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the latest frigates are of particular importance given the latest warnings that the maritime power of Germany is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defense Commission, acknowledged that the Military Navy “started to remain without vessels that could be sent to missions.”
The officer said that the problem has steadily increased over time, because the old vessels have been removed without being replaced with some new ones.
It deplored the fact that none of the frigates in Baden-Wuerttemberg class went into operation within the Military Navy.
National Trust spyes on the secret life of bats
New researches that are carried out on a property of the Scottish Highlands want to reveal how they use the surrounding environment bat to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these unusual flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will analyze common dwarf bats and pygmy bats as well as ear bats and water bats from Invewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be located in key places around the property to track the activity of bats during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using manual detectors.
The specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and what species emit certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of habitat and a report, to create a detailed, scaled picture of their behavior in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used for each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grassland, and which is the best way to maintain forest forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work that affects nests as well as habitat loss.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are the traps for flies and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also attacks on domestic cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echoing technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, thinks very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who conduct regular studies, control nests and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization even created the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland, on the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland are found.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here at Thrave, the area is wonderful for bats," he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need them to multiply."
It stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance work on property, because simply unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chickens, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected, and killing, harassment or harassment, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the audience to help them.
It said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species. ”
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "will advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
Portugal's attacker and the Juventus team were accused of violating a woman from America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas, in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video on Instagram Live for his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo said that they are "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the winner of the Golden Balloon in front of the video room.
“I want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous by using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of these accusations, which they have called "an inadmissible report of life-threatening suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player will seek compensation for “moral damage equivalent to an adequate amount for the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he raped an anal, according to documents filed at the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
The mayor claimed that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told him that he was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "a percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
The mayor claimed that he addressed the police and that his photographs of her injuries were made at the hospital, but later accepted an understanding outside the courtroom because she was "sterified of the possibility of revenge" and was worried that she would "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now looking to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian Giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "will regret forever" loss of car manufacturers
Britain would "sorry forever" if it lost world leader status in the production of cars after Brexit, said Secretary for Business Greg Clark.
He added that it is "anxiety" that Toyota UK has told BBC that if Britain will come out of the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese auto producer said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, the production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they were afraid of coming out of the EU without a cross-border trade agreement.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit will close the Oxford factory where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of the "fix time" principle: for cars manufactured at the command, the pieces arrive within 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems on the border, which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than the inventory for one day at his Derbyshire factory, says the company, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said that The Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "precisely balanced to avoid these delays on the border."
“There must be an agreement. We want to have the best deal, which will allow us not only to enjoy today’s success but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said for the BBC Radio 4 show.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other producers shows that we must continue to use what has been a very successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not specify how long production will have to be stopped, but it warned that higher prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the long-term factory and eventually lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: “Experience taught me that, after I disappeared, these jobs do not return.”
A government spokesman said: "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “send another week”, because the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, the links between Trump's and Russia's aid and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
The rumors of the possibility of Trump dismissing the Deputy Attorney General, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, circulated in Washington circles for months.
Early in the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president by means of amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and the reports claim he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced for Thursday a meeting with Trump, who was at that time at the New York headquarters of the United Nations.
Trump said that he would " prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate's legal commission, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked for a one-week FBI inquiry into charges against Kavanaugh, which again delayed the vote in the Senate plenum.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “Even if it has not been established once, it may be this week, or may be delayed for a week, taking into account all the other things now happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would argue: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House on 10 September.
Gazda Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by the antipathy to TV reporters who like to play, although he added: “I do not deny that they like to show.”
Then he suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president took part in more questions and answers than all previous presidents,” she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: “I have analyzed the figures.”
"There will be briefings," said Sanders, but "it seems much better that the press have the opportunity to address the questions directly to the president of the United States, not to me.
We're trying to do this most of the time and you could notice that we've done this many times in the last few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace press briefings when it's available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with his visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this happens, with an improvised appearance, on bizarre locations, in front of the assembled reporters.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health shall, in a letter, be addressed to EU employees of the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on the concerns related to Brexit
The Secretary of State wrote to the EU employees working at the NHS subsidiary in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under conditions that are less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already made a commitment to bear the costs for applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “In summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be taken this fall.
But the United Kingdom government began to prepare more and more for a different scenario, where there would be no EU exit agreement.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I wish to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleges in the European Union, but also outside, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health service and also bring benefits to patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your house and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is subjected to emergency surgery after having suffered a head strike
The founder of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he suffered a head strike on Saturday, in the game that his team lost in front of the Vanderbilt Commodoros team, score 31-27, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
The senior coach of the Tennessee State team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
“He got to the line of cough and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on the oxygen mask by the physical trainers and medical personnel on the cough line before sitting on a plate and carrying it from the field for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie came out of the operation he was subjected to at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/threatening of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a student in the year 2, is in his first season in Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, it managed to make five total plaques before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 plaques throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp judicial fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom, following that extra money is used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote
The stamp fee will be applied to persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom
The treasury is expected to collect up to £120 million per year for the aid of homeless people
Foreign buyers will apply a higher stamp tax rate to purchase a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as is to be announced today Theresa May.
The change will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, promising homes with more advantageous prices and targeting people with high incomes.
The higher stamp fee will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support Government efforts to help homeless people.
Suprataxa, which is added to the current stamp legal fee, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and the properties purchased for the purpose of renting, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring an increase of up to £120 million per year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are bought by non-residents in the United Kingdom, leading to rising prices and making it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks since Boris Johnson asked to reduce the stamp court fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices on property as a result of the purchase of land without using them and called on Theresa May to waive taxes on affordable houses in order to solve the "home problem" in the UK.
Corbyn has announced a number of proposals for attractive reforms in the real estate sector, including checks on rents and halting unsolicited evacuations.
He also wishes to offer the larger councils with regard to the construction of new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my first mandate to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means solving the problems that exist in the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with seats abroad, can buy houses as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become a much too distant one, and living in uncompromising conditions is far too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to be the manager of the national team of Scotland"
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that his final goal is to become, at some point, the manager of the national team of Scotland.
Scotsman, 42 years of age, enjoys the challenge of "reviving" the north-eastern club, which is currently on the third place in the First League, with a difference of three points compared to the first place.
He moved this summer to the team on the Stadium after last season, the return of St. Mirren's football team to the first Scottish Premiership division.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got to the B team of the national and about that," Ross said for Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“But I spent a lot of my childhood chasing Scottish matches at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I succeed as club manager."
Among Ross' predecessors, as managers of the Sunderland club, are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager of the Alloa Athletic club said he had no emotions to be successor to such consecrated names and to such an important club after he refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that concerns me and that could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team return to the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow him to be in Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get her there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club's return to Premier League."
Ross has a three-year management experience after a period when he was an assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the Alloa club come back after regrading in Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from backgrading, helping the team win the title champion next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was a turning point," he said about taking over the Alloa Club.
“I really thought I was more of a manager than a player.
Maybe it sounds weird, 'cause we had a good time, we earned well and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I'm dealing with similar situations as a manager, with regard to stress and pressure, but I feel it's the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, that I can do this, I feel like it's the best thing that suits me in my whole adult life."
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 at the Sportsound show on Radio Scotland.
The ideal time to drink a beer bell is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey
The heat in this summer has led to an increase in revenue in the UK pubs, but putting more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
According to figures, pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the revenues of the restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the representative of the CGA that provides business consultancy services and conducted the survey, said: “Constant heat and England’s participation in the World Cup for a longer period than the expected one contributed to a printing in July, similar to that of the previous month, when pubs registered with up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers smaller than 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June has also dropped further in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve food have recorded losses caused by heat, but not as large as those of the restaurants.
It seems that people went out to town just to eat drinks.
The sales of drinks at all bars and pubs have increased by 6.6% this month, and the food has dropped by 3%."
Paul Newman, the representative of the RSM that provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of sporting and social events of magnitude remain among the most important factors contributing to the OOH sales associated with advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to record losses, although the decrease in sales by 4.8% per year will be added to current cost pressures.
Long summer canicular could not come at a bad time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the low number of newly launched locations.
The company that monitors sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion pounds, which is the official industrial standard.
One of five children has a secret account on a social network that is hiding from parents
According to a survey, one out of five children, some even up to 11 years old, have a secret account on a social network that is hiding from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 gymnasium students revealed an increase in "false Insta" accounts
Knowledge has increased the fear of sexual posts
20% of students said they had a "principal" account shown to their parents
One of five children, some even up to the age of 11, creates an account on a social network that is hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 gymnasium students revealed a rapid increase in “instal fake” accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
Knowledge has increased fears about posts with sexual content.
20% of students said they had a "principal" and "clean" account shown to their parents, but they also had other private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, observed a teen's post asking for "violate".
According to research, carried out by the Digital Awareness company in the United Kingdom and the directory association (HMC – Headsmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them recognized that they own secret accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers do not have access to.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Commission of the Scots
Eilidh Doyle was elected as Director, without Executive Power, of the Commission of the Scots at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field athlete and track in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie described the change as a great opportunity for those making decisions on sports to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained at the international level in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the athletes community in Scotland, Great Britain, as well as throughout the world, and we are sure that the Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with his inclusion in the commission,” Beattie said.
Doyle also said: “I am pleased that I will be able to represent athletes and I hope to have a real contribution and to help how sports are being carried out in Scotland.”
The American Athlete of Nationality, which won the 200-400-foot-tests at the 1996 Atlanta Games on top of the four gold medals won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator at the BBC, remained invalid after he suffered a transient ischemic attack.
It tweeted: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide whether or not I will recover.
It was a titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to go again, and today they do agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertising that compares women with cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A breast-bombing company has caused the division of public opinion in the online environment to compare mothers who breast-feed cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be “the first silent and portable breast pump in the world,” the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic commercial, inspired by a music video, to present the freedom that the new pump offers to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay for cows on a song that includes such verses as: “Yes, I grow up, but I have no tail” and “where you have not noticed, these are not burdens, but my breasts.”
The cooler continues: “I pump, pump, breast-feed, pump, pump, pump, extract milk from girls.”
However, the commercial, published on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of them saying that it is out of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that they are stolen from their children at only a few days from birth," wrote one person.

Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Others added: “A highly inappropriate commercial.”
Other people defended the commercial, a person claiming that it seemed like a hilarious commercial.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if we were still breast-feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a cow.
The claim is a little inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is great," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun commercial for mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like “wine”.
It's not a commercial that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they danced with discreet pumps introduced into bras.
The concept that lies at the base of the campaign is that many women who use breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and it fits discreetly into a nursing bra, giving women freedom of movement, the possibility of holding their children in arms and even getting out of town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and designer at Mother, commented: “Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
By comparing breast feeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what the use of a breast pump and challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump gets on the front page.
During the presentation of fashion creator Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been transferred underground to a refugee camp from the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children increased, although the number of people who crossed the border each month remained relatively the same, largely because rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by Trump administration caused the difficulty of placing children in sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and fear that they will endanger their stay in the country if they ask to take children.
Risks increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of the customs and immigration authority (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80% of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor family live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we're gonna keep looking for that guy," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of processing in the children’s system, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which the children must be present in court at one month of detention, and not at 60 days as set out in the previous standard, according to the employees of the shelters.
Many will plead on the case through a video call, and not personally before an immigration judge, to apply for the status of legal resident.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more they can become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempts to escape, according to the employees of the shelters and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns are accentuated in a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that the signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed, because of the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria demands American, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria was at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also interim prime minister, said that foreign military forces are illegally located in a Syrian territory, under the pretext of countering terrorism and that “the situation will be managed appropriately”.
“They must withdraw immediately and without any condition,” he said at the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been destroyed from their homes.
He further stated that Damascus will continue “this sacred battle until we remove the terrorist groups and the illegal foreign presence of all Syrian territories.”
In Syria, there are about 2,000 military troops in the United States, which deal in particular with the training and counseling of Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
Also, in the war-stricken country there are more than 1,000 French military troops.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Moualem said that there are favourable conditions for returning them and accused “a few Western countries” of “striking out irrational fears”, which led refugees to keep their distance.
He added: "I have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return."
"They have brought political influences into a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there will be a political agreement between Assad and the war opposition.
The United Nations Diploma states that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to drive away the last group of rebels created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has contributed to the avoidance of a large-scale assault with the help of the Syrian forces, supported by the Russians, on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear limit terms" and expressed its hope that military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations emissary, hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new committee of government members and opposition to the drafting of a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the ground for elections.
Moulem presented the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the Committee's activities should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and issued an interference warning.
Why Will Trump Win Second Term?
If we follow this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, except when the removal procedure or the scandals will end the President's mandate earlier, which much of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case it would be, without any doubt, “the most dramatic end of a president's term of office of all time.”
Until now, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, the first-time audiences have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the prime time, the Fox News television station is followed on average by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was followed by 1.7 million, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" show recorded a record of hearing, with 3.5 million people who followed it in the evenings where important news was broadcast.
“This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s dramatic “Reservation Chair”, about a cabinet secretary who is president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with a vast field experience and authoring the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why did she ask.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’ Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be whole and about the state of the global economy.
Changing the job is a luxury that can allow only the privileged audience.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you reach the sixth hour of viewing the debate by an expert committee of how Bob Woodward uses "deep background" (confidential) sources for his book, "Fear", about Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather jacket ("an opulent dress object", according to The Washington Post) and the shocking implications of Stormy Daniels actress's "anatomical parties" of Trump.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"A large part of what it makes you feel that you look at a reality show and it feeds you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment media group and the creator of the release "As well as the morning" on the distribution constantly changed and the changes in the daily situation caused by Trump (deployment of a story with the American football pro league, the praise brought to Kim Jong-Un).
You don't allow yourself to lose an episode, because you'll feel like you're left behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his home on the northern shore of the island of Kaua, out there were 27 degrees and there was sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording on CNN.
It could not be released from the front of the television, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate's legal commission and the future Supreme Court would be decided.
“I remember performing some joint broadcasts in the past, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right.”

Overcoming external financial resources for the closest intermediate choices associated with the Chamber of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of the electoral districts, of which two mandate holders have resulted in an electoral race for the same function, it is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th electoral district enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburg district brought in the race the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another in-service mandate holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, now the 12th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps significantly with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, being manipulated the boundaries of the districts in favour of the republicans.
The new 17th electoral district race launched a competition to finance campaigns between important party funding bodies, the Congress Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in special elections, of the highest audience, which took place in March for the 18th district of the state of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade the function had been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, Democrats enjoy an easy advantage.
The United States took into account the penalisation of El Salvador because of its agreement with China, but then gave up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Panamanian Republic, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization's management team.
The State Department officials have decided to call the heads of the diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of the "new decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions were taken against El Salvador, which received US aid of approximately $140 million in 2017, including for the control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country of Central America and the high rate of unemployment and crimes in Central America.
As internal meetings have made progress, officials from North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference, focused on security and economic prosperity, in order to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the movement of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials clearly showed that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively completing any examination of the sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned for Vice-President Mike Pence to address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, wishing to highlight the importance that the administration grants to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson of the White House for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymously.
Their reports were co-ordinated by an external analyst, who is a closely related to the administration and who also spoke on condition of keeping the anonymity.
Study of history
The next thing that might happen is the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
Mueller also seems to focus on investigating and investigating the existence of a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia with regard to the attack on American elections.
If Congress changes, Trump will face due responsibility within the body, even when it is prepared to appear in front of the voters and possibly a jury made up of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "fall" is inevitable, which is also valid for his European counterparts.
There are choices we have to make on the one hand and on the other from the Atlantic that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to give a state strike against Hitler, only if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
I failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing some of these critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump resigns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man controlling the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this paper that last year he suggested the President's secret registration and speculated about his incompatibility with his role as president.
Rosenstein said the Times newspaper's story is wrong.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigations concerning Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and lying testimony?
And above all, will we vote for the intermediate elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, after the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jewess who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the tuft.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers will be host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrian match, after the impressive match in Spain against the Villarreal team from the beginning of the month, will place it on a strong position to qualify as Group G of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow the middle Graham Dorrans to play this season until equal to 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers team can use this in its advantage to achieve better performances.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old player said.
“I started the game thinking that we’ll get a good result and we’ve won a point.
We probably could have signed up at the end, but overall, I think the tie was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first round, and we've noticed better in the second.
Thursday, it will be a very important night for Europe again.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game. However, having support, we will certainly feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; training also goes well.
Let us hope that we will persevere, that we will leave the last season behind and that we will have good results."
Women have insomnia because of retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to family members about this.
About half of the people who participated in the study conducted by the Nationwide company said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with the husband/sociation.
Only 10 percent of them said they talked to their children about this.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t start this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your husband/sister and children: You can't prepare your family to provide the care you need if you don't make your wishes known in time.
Work with the counselor and the family to discuss the place and how you will receive care, because these choices could be a significant factor in setting costs.
Involve your financial adviser: and the financial adviser may be of real help in the payment of such expenditure.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses or you can secure your own welfare – to the extent you have your money.
Put your legal documents in place: come in the face of legal issues.
Get a power over medical decisions, to designate a trusted person to monitor your medical care and to ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Also consider exercising authority over your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid, if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that a parent of yours at an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not all about the financial side alone. Can you tell who the doctors are dealing with it,” Martin asked.
“What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Draft a plan on all these things."
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot several times with a compressed air gun as he went home after one night in the city.
Victim, 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2:30 p.m., as being “accidentally shots”.
The victim failed to see his attacker.
The wounded did not put their lives at risk, and the police called on witnesses to make statements.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the town of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster management authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Doganda Regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after disaster production.
Here are some key information about Palu and Dongala from the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the downtown Sulawesi island, which lies at the end of a narrow golf course on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunami and earthquake.
Domalaka is a regency that stretches over a coast with a surface of over 300 km north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The Region, an administrative region below a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fish and agriculture activities are the central point of the province's economy in the center of the island of Sulawesi, in particular the coastal region Donggana.
Mining activities for the extraction of nickel are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Disaster Management Agency in Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Also, in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Domanga Kingdom, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Circle of Fire, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province Aceh, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half being from Aceh.
2005: a series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of 6.8 degrees on the Richter scale struck the southernmost Indonesian islands, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: an earthquake of 7.6 degrees on the Richter scale took place near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
They've been killed over 1,100 people.
2010: an earthquake of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai islands, off the coast of Sumatra Island, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres, which destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in the kingdom of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and panic, as people remembered the earthquake and the devastating tsunami in 2004, which fought with a large number of deaths.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: More powerful earthquakes took place on the island of Lombok, causing the death of more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stuck under debris.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate to the post of vice president, Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29 years old, in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence claim and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the state police.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to complain about the alleged crimes, she took her phone.
Palin is in police custody, in the Mat-Su unit, waiting for the process, and is held on the basis of a security-free cage, worth $500, according to KTUU.
It was presented on Saturday in court, where it was declared “100% innocent” when requested by the network.
Palin is facing three charges of Class A crimes, which means that he could be incarcerated for a period of up to one year and fined at $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been brought such accusations.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce alleged aggression.
The case is under trial at the Court of Veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, implicated in a complaint of a domestic violence crime and held in possession of a weapon while being drunk about an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered after being part of the Iraqi military forces.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake took place off the central Sulawesi province, in the north-eastern Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Socializing networks circulate videos presenting the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutor's Office wishes capital punishment for the New York City terrorist suspect
The New York Federal Prosecutor's Office wishes the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City after which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that was no longer applied to the state for a federal offence since 1953.
It seems that 30-year-old Saipov used a truck rented Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track on the lower Manhattan West Side highway, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his path in October.
In order to justify capital punishment, the prosecutor must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intendedly” and caused “intensely” serious bodily injuries, according to the intention of requesting capital punishment, filed in New York’s Southern District.
Both counts may receive a capital sentence, according to the court's document.
A few weeks after the attack, a major federal jury accused Saipov of 22 counts, including eight criminal charges in support of the organized crime, usually used by the federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," said the prosecutors, describing how Saipov executed the act as "greed, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, sufferings and losses for the following families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in the South District of New York.
The street, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers, but finally he was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being sentenced under the conspiracy charge to the commission of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents in the court, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators he liked what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt inspired to execute the attack after he looked at the ISIS group videos on his phone, according to the buyer.
Also, according to the police, he asked to tree the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded innocent in respect of the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defenses in the office who represented Saipov, said they were obviously " disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, instead of accepting a life sentence complaint, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply the capital punishment.
A Member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party maintains that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel pressure" from Euroceptians, following a statement by a member of the Theresa May Parliament who suggested that this should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, Member of the Conservative Party, told a Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom would "come out" until now if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge that May faces in relation to the extremely divided camps was emphasized by members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest, against the exit of the European Union in the city.
The Prime Minister tries out of his power as his compromise plan, so-called the Chequers plan, to carry out properly, facing attacks on those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to remain in it, as well as on the European Union.
The Allies stressed that she will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, no matter what the consequences are, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and ‘chaos’.
Bone said in the Pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wants "renunciation to the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be on the team and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were led by him, I was no longer in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of Wellingborough, added: “I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Czechs plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “I did not fight in the world war to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied the suggestions on the change of public opinion at the 2016 vote: “It is not true that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain in the Union.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to people’s voices.
"The public disagrees with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it and neither our activists coming out on the street and supporting us, firstly, in elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message to Theresa May, he added: “Ministers who keep their jobs are the ones who keep their promises.”
In the meeting, Nigel Farage said that politicians should be put in a position to “feel the pressure” if they are about to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
“Try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that “we will not let them do this.”
In a message to the enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the civil army of the country that has brought us victory to Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who claim to remain in the European Union have marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A small group of activists raised banners that the Conservative Party wrote against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at members of the Conservative Party and at the security issues they faced in the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for digitizing customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a farce.
Brexit doesn't bring any benefits," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running for the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously consider running for the presidency after the November elections.
According to Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat Senatorate spoke on Saturday about her future during a mayoral meeting in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running to be re-elected at the November elections against Geoff Diehl, member of the House of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could beat Trump by 2020.
The afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with the right-to-voting citizens using the seat of the mayor since Trump took up the role as president.
A participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to arrive in Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government and this includes that in its head there is a woman."
A suspect was arrested in the event of death that caused the death of the player Sims from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the event of death that caused the death of basketball player Wayde Sims from LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of Friday's shooting, asking for help in identifying the man in the picture.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the spot, that he was in possession of a weapon, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player, with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the original lot in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries on the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team will have an essential role in the race.
Finding the first position in the ranking, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first one who stopped at the box and left Hamilton at the tail of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped a shift later in boxing and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to move forward after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inside free, after he made a double move to defend himself at the third turn.
Max Verstappen began the race in the rear row of the carousel and was on the 7th place near the end of the first tour, even on the day when he was 21 years old.
Then he was in the front for a large part of the race, aiming at a quick finish and trying to get past Kimi Raikkonen and take the fourth place.
Finally, he stopped at the boxing tour with number 44, but he couldn't step up in the last eight tours, Raikkonen remaining on the fourth place.
“It was a difficult day. Valteri did an exceptional job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman, letting me go through the front.
And the team did an excellent job to get victory in front of Ferrari and to achieve this double," Hamilton said.
A Horrible Body Language
President Donald Trump insulted Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday, in a rally on the subject of his insistence that she did not facilitate the "scurry" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court for sexual assault.
Speaking in a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee, stating instead that what happens in the Senate has shown that people are "raised, immoral and liars".
"The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and immoral and liars," he said.
“When you see that they have published and leaked information and then say that they have not.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she made it easier for the document to leak?
Do you remember her answer? She said: umm..poftim?
Oh, no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, I didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent his letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "scurred" in September, but Feinstein denied that "scurry" occurred from her office.
“I didn’t hide the charges regarding Ford and I’m not the one that made it easier to “run” her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to Hill.
"He asked me to keep confidentiality and that's exactly what I did."
But her denial does not seem to have hit the president well, who commented during the Saturday rally: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the most terrible body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to achieve their own ends.
“They are determined to take over power in any way possible.
Observe the wickedness, immorality, don't care who they hurt and who they need to destroy in order to gain power and control," the president said, according to the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee Star Team wins with 5-3 in front of Belfast Giants Team
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee Team
Dundee's Star Team paid for Friday's Elite League loss, winning in front of Belfast's Giants team in the Saturday return game, with the 5-3 score in Dundee.
The Giants team had a two-point advance, the hits being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyer brought Giants back to the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard matched the Dundee score before two goals marked by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to ensure their victory.
It was the third defeat in the League of Elites this season for the players of Adam Keefe, who had recovered land by winning the Dundee team on Friday evening 2-1.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening show took place in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from a step by Kendall McFaull, and then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's advantage four minutes later.
In a game that started so dynamic, Sullivan brought back the host team in the game in minute 13:10, before Matt Marquardt offered him the opportunity to sign up for a score equal in minute 15:16.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants team before the first break, when he entered his second goal at the end of the first round.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard rematched with an impressive goal in the minute 27:37.
Later, in the second round, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen get an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that game, thus ensuring the team's climb to place 5 in the ranking, halfway to the last upgrade.
The Giants team, who now lost four of the last five games, will be, on Friday, host for Milton Keynes in their next match.
An air traffic controller died after ensuring the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after ensuring the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a strong earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong appeals in the area and many people are stuck under the remains of the town of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grande refused to leave the post of the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was rocking strongly.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the track at that time, will take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that he was about to crash.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson of the air navigation service provider in Indonesia stated that it is possible that the decision would have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia's post.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are distressed by this news," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, the national disaster management agency saying that access is limited in Dongala, Sigi and Boutong cities.
"We believe the number will increase, because many victims are still in ruins and we have not had access to many of them," the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The valleys with a height of up to six metres devastated the city of Palu, and on Sunday there was a common funeral.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
A 35 - year - old mother named Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the minimarkets are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said for CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to offer help to survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to accomplish all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" announced CNN.
Indonesia was rocked at the beginning of this year's earthquake in Lombok, which was fought with more than 550 dead.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now said that a person was missing, after earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that a male passenger is missing from the afternoon of Saturday.
He also mentioned that he was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The United States Air Company and Naval Forces said the plane missed the runway and arrived in a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses believe the plane has crossed the end of the track.
U.S. national passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the river, and to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the escorts panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States naval forces said that the sailors working nearby for the renewal of a landing jump in help, using a inflatable boat to transport people on the shore before the plane sinks 30 metres below water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents of some airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them have included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents the night history in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. concluded his plea regarding the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the United States Department of Justice, has testified for several hours as an expert witness in the information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used his mobile phone records to lead the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, as well as his victim Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received locator data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night she was killed, which was in contradiction with his earlier statements, according to Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the witness box and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he “liest, because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsequence was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records indicate that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact data from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: what is the conscious hip-hop?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way that this type of music is seen, with the help of positive-message songs.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social issues, as it initially did.
They want to return to their origins and make the hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the United Kingdom has been observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another color person?!
A nanny from New York sues a couple for firing her after she received a "raist" text message
A nanny in New York sues a couple for firing for discriminatory reasons after she had, by mistake, received a text message from her mother, complaining that she was “a still black person”.
The couple denied that they were racists, claiming that she sued them for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed his discontent when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, is colourful, when she presented herself on the first day of work in 2016.
"NUUUUUUUUUUUU! IN A CULAR PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the gaffe, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, did not perform her duties properly and that she was expected to receive a Philippine nanny nanny, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day's work and sent home with Uber.
She now sues the couple to pay for the dismissal and seeks the amount of $350 per day for six months, the period when they were to live with them and perform their work, despite the fact that this is done without a contract concluded.
“I want to show them not to do such things,” she said Friday for the Post newspaper, adding “I know it’s about discrimination.”
The couple denied the claims that they were racists, saying it was normal to fire Maurice, because they feared they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent her a wrong message.
She's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, her husband, for the Post newspaper.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have made a mistake, even if by mistake?
Newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process of “extrusion”, Plasco said that his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person under such circumstances?
Not doing that," the bank investor added.
While the process is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple of socializing networks, judging them for the behavior and logic they have shown.
The publishers of Paddington's story were afraid that readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny now, after I saw Paddington had a huge success."
It further stated that his father, who was a chamberman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the anniversary at the time of the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was a "dulce-meaux" after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride on the success of which he later enjoyed.
"He was quite a quiet man and he didn't like to brag," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, though it’s not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Though his creation was based on his imagination, he always used to give his credit to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye by phone
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
“It doesn’t sound often to tell me it’s very serious and doesn’t think it’s going to survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me she'll die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, “Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines given by doctors to keep her heart pumping blood began to decrease and come out of her body.
He died a short time ago and the organs began to stop working.
I've been forced to sit there and wait, aware of everything that's going on.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, being in mourning after his daughter's death, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“I kept my head down and tears kept flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy towards the Nad.
I realized I needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two grieving women place different messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones because they killed themselves trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place several messages on a bridge in Wales, many of them being motivating and including phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, age 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a soft smile.
“Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile changes your disposition."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had reached a very unfortunate moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he had taken his life.
Davis said: “I keep thinking you will have a domino effect.”
This created the messages “to pass on to people that I may call on someone or that I can talk to someone, even a friend.
Outside, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies's friend for many years, lost Mark, the life partner he was 15 years old, just after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children made their gifts and didn't even look in their eyes."
She said that her death was an immense trauma to them, but she must overcome it: “It caused great pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake, following the initiation of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for – an investigation over a limited period of time and of limited scope – we could have a few units,” said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that they fear the commission is about to “disintegrate” on the bottom of a partisan lock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their retention is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks left until the 6 November elections - if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they want to win at the elections for the highest court in the country will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush kept calling the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through which he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finishes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, vice-president, to make the difference in the case of equality and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives in North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-one came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean parliamentman.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean unification ministry, said last year they fled the country approximately 1,127 people, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were controls at the stricter border between North Korea and China and the higher rates charged by those who smuggled people across the border.
The Phenian didn't make any public comments.
A vast majority of the Northern fugitives are finally offered them South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers fugitives rather illegal migrants than refugees and often returns forced.
Relations between North and South, which are still, practically, in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenian for a few discussions that had been the subject of the denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate on a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused that the United States sanctions have caused the lack of progress ever since.
"If we can't trust the United States, we won't be able to trust our national security, and in such situations, we won't be the first to disarm unilaterally," Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "historical" saying he is incapable of serving the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court as "historical" and said that his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made his comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if she was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared “sterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate’s legal commission, which took place Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that he would sexually harass Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost shouted and lost his voice because of emotions, while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling the charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated assassination of character", organised by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when she was asked whether she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and whether Democrats would win the majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if you don't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but not for the court in which you are now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Columbia District Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Law accessible to care or the Roe versus Wade case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect to say, “Oh, that’s great,” Pelosi said.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diarrhym, it's months and years of accumulated rage, and it can't talk without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman in an executive position, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You may think I’m sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then continue.
I thought it was a great thing."
The tears are allowed for the extortion of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I started crying because of an inexpressible rage, is that I was stabbed by the back of an older woman, a cold direction that I've always felt a bit of fear, and he took me to the stairwell house.
"You must never see yourself crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be happy that they caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democrat in Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extra-conjugal relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, who was extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason to run for even the presidency.
“It wasn’t a very good decision,” she says laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "White like Snow and the seven dwarfs".
Because the campaign was at the end, she was behind the fundraiser and swore she wouldn't run unless she managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given her men $1,000, they only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she asked.
During the speech when he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so touched by emotions – as a result of the gratitude for the people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice because of emotions .
“You would have said that I have a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls about the reactions of the press to her.
"You said one of my sponsors is Kleenex."
I remember thinking about what they'll write on my gravestone.
"He cried?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial to Beijing?
Salves that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China were absurd and, although it seems to be longer until the end of the war, the disputes between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning at the beginning of this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new taxes, which affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), actually applying taxes for half of all goods in China arriving in the United States.
Beijing has been revenged every time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10 per cent for US products worth 60 billion dollars.
China has warned that it will respond to every strike from the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world will take a step back in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its demands, but publicly yielding to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the United States' pressures on trade war could positively support China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would, in fact, be more dangerous than what has been expected so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security (Center for New American Security), a group of experts.
Syria is prepared for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the conditions on the scene are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists so that things get back to normal.
Existing conditions allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affect their daily lives and lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder 2018 cup after winning the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the edge of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded the sixth consecutive win in Europe and no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe came first after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn got 14,5 points, needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Miccelson, who made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial hit in the water to the third hair at the 16th hole, giving off Francesco Molinari's match.
The Italian golf player Molinari has had an incredible performance in all rebukes, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since there is the current tournament format, since 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost at the 5th and 4th holes in front of the player in the top ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen in Denmark.
The first player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 in front of Ian Poulter in England, which is probably his last game in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with the most winners, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and that he believed in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It's a team job and I'm glad I could be of help," Garcia said excitedly after the European victory.
He handed over the seal to his coroner, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American legend of golf, at holes 2 and 1, to the individual game, on Sunday.
“I’m very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to follow the games when I was a kid,” Rahm said, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all times, who won 14 important titles, being only exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team put real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinary throughout the whole tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of them, they really tried.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a bluff fight.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will go further.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to give them proper respect.
They played better than us."
