What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elected members in the capital city will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The newspaper Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argut that was born in recent years in the city hall, when they were the partners of the current coalition leading to Prague.
The vocabulary coded that Prague's political cream has set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Well describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the new electors did not understand well known terms.
At least they say it.
Who's Valdemort?
"I really don't know."
"I am a jeunôt in pragoso politics has reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected to culture at the test of the vocabulary of the "parein".
And for the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the sense of "golf meeting".
"It's the only expression you're proposing that I use."
Otherwise, I don't use the bow.
From vocabulary, including the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-ectoral congress of the ODS, the writing chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the mayorate of Prague.
Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf course in Prague", going to the pastry, "boeuf nerf", "capital betrayal" and "enroll".
Three of the electors agreed for the quiz, the fourth-Antonin Weinert, which has to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then didn't unplug the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek refused the test.
"I don't care about all of these things and how the representatives of civil democracy are fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we will understand each other in our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the above legend that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky, and the only expression he came into the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the White Tunnel," said Kaucky and immediately added, "but I know about the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he joked.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected for the environment, knowing that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social democrats know who really is Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "go to the pastry".
"It's about, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it's about the headquarters of the Janousek companies.
On the same subject, your Brezina recalls that he learns about newspapers rather than some vocabulary he would use.
According to candidates for testing, there is no lexicon of argué in social democracy.
"I took counsel with colleagues and it turns out that we really don't have anything like that."
"The names are said to be sometimes used with abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Socio-Democrat Party, which the members of the Party call Hulda.
"We used to call me Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me like that, confess Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and it worked.
The elected Weinert is Papy for members of the Party or the least friendly Old Little, the Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scams during the party's sponsoring, is called the "little play".
Surnames are also the only ones who admit to using social democrats within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this pragmatic president.
"Doctor in matraque law" it seems that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title as a doctor in juridical law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "surgeries", a brochure was published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, they cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "sister" is isolated to avoid threatening the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has this destiny."
"We don't judge young women in good health either because they participate in work and give birth to children," said a sister in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of over 100 women who were rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He edited a brochure that should help limit the witch hunt.
The case involves a "hic".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read", said Die Standard about the inconvenience of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and one man and burned with oil they had sprinkled on her.
It was the BBC server who sent this information.
Criminals say it was the bad eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointings has ignited to the woman's contact.
The oil ignited, it seemed, when the team wanted to "get the wrong spirit" of the woman.
Isolation of "surgery" is approved by people from all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying, "Human-spirited eaters have always been a danger," he said.
As Burkina Faso attempts to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia did not later than last year even saw the President himself participating in it.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a large hunt for witches who, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have struggled by the black magic to kill the President as well."
"Samans from Guinea coming to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and personal custody of the President, men and women randomly selected in the villages of Gambia," said the organization "Amnesty International.
On the farm, people in prison were to drink a potion based on plants with hallucinogenic effects, in addition to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
About a thousand people were released on international pressure.
Bakal's tenant: The heated chickens, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out of the door of the client centre of the RPG Byty company of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who is serving a penalty.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3,500 the wire will have to settle from next year for a second category 2+1 apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works for solid fuel", shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed anyway" explains he moved in anger and half resigned.
The citizens' association of BytyOKD.cz apartments that described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to it by a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by rubbing the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulation laboratory.
After New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic expect, whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has for this reason decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Right next to the door is a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "layer 2011", is activated on the touch screen.
One pressure and one paper with an output number from the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already starts lighting up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short time, an old couple arrives to learn about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to deal with common issues like everywhere - requests for repairs, insurance events, and so on.
In the Ostrava region, more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio include mails with new lease contracts in their letter boxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
the special rental window has been open to the public since 18 November.
"it's been working for about a week, so it's still on the test" responds, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the window when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and former Bakal minor apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and originating in the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region of Social Democrats reported this in a rather sustained manner before the elections, and it now completes the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They haven't even changed a putt...n from board in the toilets, relieved in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mainly employees who come to be sure that they will receive a refund on the new rent price if they now sign as the RPG promised in a special offer.
The other tenants who signed their new contract before December 15 will receive half of the rent.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed by questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent it," the employee says at the window.
And yet RPG is posted both on its website and in individual interview windows on rents when necessary.
If both parties fail to agree on rent, the decision will be taken by an independent court.
'These are not threats, but only information on the unique and legitimate way to act legally', says RPG on its website.
"Here no one will go to court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street in front of the client centre is right.
"I have 13,000 retirement crowns and I have 5,000 left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and so people wait," she says.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011, and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"In addition, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, which is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in the 4 billion apartments, in four years 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hung on the ceiling in front of the crowded chairs of the Havirovka Street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments'.
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per month," the screen says.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low sum 19.66 Czech crowns at m2," he added.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money of the increase in rents (cf. the graph) is returned to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
Maternal school is also a part of the offices of the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new seat of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini school motherhood with all that it needs - colour walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of the employees of Arch. design can go there.
The Arch. Design project-architectonics company, whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has imagined its mini-maternal business school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially from the age of children, and it was important for women architects and project leaders to be able to quickly return to work.
At the same time as low-time employment contracts, the school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work with care for children.
They are the employees of Arch.Design.they themselves imagined this school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-maternal school is financed through the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
They were able to purchase equipment and equipment, and after two years they were able to provide qualified personnel, as well as on the way.
After the use of funding (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini-maternal school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the Economy rating company that helped to apply for staffing.
Child care is provided by a qualified staff, all day a nurse and a kindergarten teacher care for children. Children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are more than three years old for most.
As it is a "mini school motherhood" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are others who are taking their place.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is individual care and education, the programme of the mini-primary school is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children do not just play there, but quality education is also provided there - from the beginning to the preparation of schools are taught English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginary toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their children and do not have the stress of delay to look for children in a remote school from their parents' workplace.
Parents use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship between the employee and the employer is created.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look into Gaudi's interiors.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric sarian, the staircase with a spinal column of dinosaur and the balconies with open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received the nickname of Maison en os from the premises.
Organic shapes, wild colours, unusual use of stones, piece of tiles and mosaic, façade recalling scales and everywhere present curves, here is all that is epic for Art New by Antoni Gaudi.
The front façade of the house runs its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
A more detailed observation shows geometry, rhythm and order thought accurately.
In the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyeleton and the blades.
The Battlo house which stands in the Eixample district on the street market Passeig de Gracia at the number. 43, was born of the construction of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of old construction and the construction of another new one but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudí's unusual reconstruction and better market.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house with multiple dwellings was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that decorations were born for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
For the facade have also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila's house and Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises nicknamed the house hot just after its finish because of its organic shapes "the House in Bone".
Others, in view of the specific opening mechanism of the windows, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi has thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with air events and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
In the course of the Gaudi creation, the construction directives were absolutely not complied with and were not allowed to be blocked by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained the building permit from the city, knowing, of course, that the data on reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and demanded changes.
He did not like, for example, the members of the municipal council that construction pillars are impeding on the public sidewalk.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call from the city Josep Battlo asked (and got satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third one room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented at a jewelery.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you can access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also works on the modern concept of space linkage.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the hall doors and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received new facades a non-traditional roof and two more floors.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the interior courtyard is decorated and with light wells.
The two-coloured game gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark that instead absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued their visits because they found that it was a lucrative business and they expanded the field of visits to common spaces and to the barn including roof terraces.
The entry ticket in the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a summary: Women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bed, so the mattress and the top provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the choice several things are decisive:the weight, the size, the age, the state of health and the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which we will place the mattress and the top is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where the latex mattresses are not continually asleep are not suitable because they are "heating" slowly.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
They need to be returned frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in their heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Measuring can also be formed.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The one who spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a grinding layer, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all hockeyists who come back from NHL complain they can't sleep there."
"For their weary shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a grinding layer of lazy foam."
"These mattresses are also recommended for people suffering from diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system that therefore take the "information" of joints and skin," Sylva Adamczikova explains, who specializes in the stuffed furniture.
That is why a few years ago the mattress with the lazy foam conquered hockeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses for example.
You don't need to be a guy from NHL in order to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing pushes you and you won't go back into the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against the squares.
For the choice of mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, i.e. about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of 180cm thus need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or at all 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokokova, President of the Association of Matellasiers and decorators who have been dedicated for several years to the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaching in specialized schools.
For a two-seat bed each needs its own top and mattress, so pay attention however during the basket to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only be able to climb the top to different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattress should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the layer of shape and aeration at least three centimeters.
"To touch or to sit on the mattress you must not feel the springs," says Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requests a well-determined type of soaking.
The summary bed, when the mattress and the summary are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; we must not wash it, which is now commonly done.
And since you normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat during the night, it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to remember a large (and slammed) slam.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make a 25-year life claim for a mattress or life assurance.
But all in his hands.
And for that, an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, to the hygiene or to the washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make coatings with sliding closure for the whole, that is, after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when you remove them a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a hard plank in your bed instead of a napkin?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the plank (if there is no) of air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with sachet springs (Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress shall not be part of such a bed.
For single-seat lams with 14/18 blades, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are folded in the bottom of the kidneys and so it is possible to regulate its rigidity.
For mattresses with multiple positions it is not necessary to take mattresses with springs because it does not respond to position changes.
In addition to the rigidity adjustment of the blades, we can also install what is called a shoulder crib.
This is a special link of the blades that allows pressure or tilt the blade to make the shoulder of the sleeper "integrate" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back," it's really important.
This is already envisaged by the mattress manufacturers who for the "male" began to use a rambling zone at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips level.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or platelet summaries with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and diinuates the tension.
But of course, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen with air) on good mattresses and soak, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its points must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the earring must level (with the shoulder crib of the top or the area which crumbles in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something common with the first straw and grass base.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in organic mattresses.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"The Bio qualification for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While extracting the bulb plants so that the mattress coating absorbs the heat and cools the body, "refroid" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weak sex.
The current favorites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a damaged cell structure thus more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of the cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, the bottom of the back and the feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, it was Gumotex who reached first place.
Saving for mattress and top is not simple.
From time to time, there may be special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers of two mattresses for one price.
Like the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam Memory stitched to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course you can take the second one for free.
The age of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
This started as a matter for NASA because astronauts were starting huge load factors.
On the contrary, the Tempor is cold and cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes it optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers, for example, use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Monitoring devices are increasingly required by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think of monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases, such as the example of the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The small Anicka case has stirred up a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We strive to tell everyone that it is not espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of poor use of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of someone who is not aware, but I have not yet met such cases."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, add Pilin.
According to him, children should always know what "box" is used for and how to use it in the event of an emergency.
Children's psychologist Dana Bockova draws attention to the fact that if the child doesn't want to wear something like this, he'll get rid of it.
'And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something explicitly when they don't want to be under control.'
"Portable phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is highly questionable.
"If it is a prepared rapture, the author will do everything to ensure that the child has no electronic device to locate it."
"Now it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
It also confesses that such devices can help in an attack that is not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, he claims that having this type of device can help, even if it has been destroyed in the case of aggression.
"The device can be set in such a way that it is on a regular emission after a specified period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
'The most expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is in an extended position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, mobile phones called intelligent ones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after they have formed it with a special software.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to the ones that are worn in the pendant of the size of a box of lighters or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can still lose them.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed as a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in auto-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating strings that it could turn the Czech Republic with, but it can only take two years.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km.
The army therefore has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating cords to the anonymous STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for a huge amount of MF DNES detonating strings that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnics, MF DNES contacted, it appears that even officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an annual exercise in explosives.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating cords.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that was true, the military reserves could be provided for 10 years.
On the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough to provide more than 2 m of detonating strings, as experts say, that means that the army with its new purchase has, together with the consumption of special units and engineering, guaranteed reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the troops of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their fist weapons and that the shooting sessions were limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of body linen we don't talk about.
"And I don't take my head if they buy in us such a lot of detonating strings."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good client that we strive as merchants to satisfy," says STV Group Jan Decky's commercial director.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of detonating stringes are caused by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reports only four years of life of the detonating cords and the police and military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the warehouses, it can even go up to four years," says one of them who does not want his name to be published in the light of the military's criticism.
The period of time spent, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a reduction due to the amount for 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km", says spokesman Pejsek, who is the interpreter of the buyers' opinion of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnics that neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always command only the amount of ammunition required to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for safety reasons of pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more flexible types of more modern and more reliable detonating string.
the Ministry of Defence today has major problems with the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the mighty Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand prepared to move, head on the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years is the Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: to neutralize hundreds of miles of old detonating strings that it buys today "at the market".
So far I benefit from contacts that I have obtained through the competitions.
The free sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition of the best individual entrepreneur for last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to succeed is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun likes to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half-demolite.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region has given me the desire to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
It reinvests the profit in the building that it converts into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his work as an entrepreneur has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all types of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four star Pytloun hotel design.
This year he had another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates at the Pytloun hotel franchise showed up", number 1 of the entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the contest of the contractor of the year has served well, added Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known to Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he uses his contacts and knowledge so far that he could not have obtained any other way.
"With those I met through the competition, I started to maintain business relations on a regular basis.
According to him, the reputation of success has also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I observe in them especially the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has generally been recognized."
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name has been pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of the victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to look for the prize in Slovansky um for the first place in the competition for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it turned a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a business firm of 100 million crowns.
'I can say that the reward has not only encouraged my staff and increased our self-confidence to fight competition," said the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet society there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he was working at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's surroundings for the manufacture of plastic bath tubs.
Not long after they started specializing in the press for vegetable oil.
He became the largest manufacturer of automatic press in central Europe after eighteen years.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to get to know the brand Farmet but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that got the greatest success in its country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not go to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the 2008 and 2009 economic results.
And just in 2009 this was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have of course not escaped this situation."
"Business figures fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even quit," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that unpopular measures must be taken from time to time.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained beneficial results even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We built a training and research centre with the endowments, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky said.
It all makes us think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of affidavits rises and with them also the number of employees.
"A new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which removes unnecessary regulations.
The year's absurdity survey is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Certain absurd regulations could be deleted.
The unglorious winner of this year's absurdity survey was the obligation to bring to the offices of documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor could obtain it in two clicks of mouse.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the Trade Register for Insurance Payment Controls," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Point out all regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must complete in the Czech Republic and remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this year's absurdity competition.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters showed up, at least 4000 voted this year.
And it's not surprising, in our country there are the most diverse legal obligations that only stop the company, and, more and more.
"We may be in the number of documents to be completed for tax returns at the top of the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a stated goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74th place in relation to the conditions for the company, i.e. 8 more places than last year.
The year's absurdity competition was first launched in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Any person may report each year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last time before the end of the competition.
To report on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Next, the competition organizer selects seven candidates for "antiprix" and lets the public vote during October at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and at www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity which has received the greatest number of votes is declared victorious.
Until last year's survey, it was a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs and also by professional unions and teachers.
The "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the nominees there is, for example, the requirement that highway and highway maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the website of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which always starts in early November on Place Venceslas in Prague, is a part of a holding that regularly participates in political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the completion of the competition.
'Economic prosperity can't work when the state beats into the legs of entrepreneurs and for that reason my goal is to delete, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the company," said Martin Kocorek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd crests is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what was not pleasing to people was the obligation of contractors to report three days before the office for the individual company to the place where the company was located, to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was deleted with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is okay until the third session of the competition.
The 2009 absurdity was the peak for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year - the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has existed for 5 years, is the category called Firm Head of the Year 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support the firm reasonably and fairly.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and carry out socially responsible activities," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the Vodaphone firm, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 Vodaphone firm's competition, companies that do not succeed with a single long-term goal for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the object of their business is different from that of each other, their support and forecasting activity can be regarded as the denominator of their efforts.
For one, this applies to persons with disabilities and to the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the Czech Republic, there is no example of the company of Pragoise and Netera pro-logics that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of the firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the staffing fund for children with disabilities for 17 years.
In order to deal with employees with health problems, the old Podebrad paper manufacturing plant, which employs more than 70 per cent, has been awarded the title of the Head of the Central Bohemian Region, which was third placed in the region in the Vodaphone Firm's competition for the year.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for introducing flexible working hours and even reduced up to 35 hours a week on average and without, proportionally, a decrease in wages.
The jury also gave it the title because it gives priority to Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyenne activity in the near environment and is concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible for our business and administration to have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of society.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At the very latest, for its activities, there is also a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonus over standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased skills and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the construction company of bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the category Responsible, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year Firm competition, who had responded to the accompanying questionnaires of the registration document and returned it to the organizer before 15 August.
The incomplete or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in high school had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm Responsible but were not disqualified from the competition "principal" the Vodaphone Year Firm".
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the firm's main competition for the year," says Karel Goldman of the organization agency Bison&Rose.
In the Plzen Land Fund, the police arrested during a public competition.
In the Plzen Land Fund building, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local contractor and traded in real estate Lubos. G.
The latter had endeavoured to handle just a call for public tenders for the settlement of a claim for restitution in such a way that the proposed land is obtained by a specific candidate.
This one was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For now I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for a crime of initiation in connection with a call for tenders and a public contest." said Pravo, the chief of Plzen's Park Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is under way.
After 24 hours, the police released this 46-year-old contractor.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate with regard to so little official information.
On one question from Pravo, the spokesperson of the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund said that the police had actually arrested Plzen at a separate workplace and, in the course of the public competition.
"He acted as a client and in no case as an employee, she specified.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call for Land Transfer Rights under the Land Act" and is set up when several legal candidates appear.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their receptacle rights which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights a ranking of buyers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's spokesman.
Lubos G. had, of course, information about the persons who had applied for the appeal and as he himself is, also, a beneficiary person since he had purchased a large number of refund entitlements, he had offered candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he would probably fit in because of his withdrawal.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his inquiry.
Lubos G. had contacts largely above the FdT (Land Fund) standards.
He was in the case of the former chief of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for the criminal prosecution for publishing land for which the decision to establish a construction had already been issued.
Justly Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, in place and place where access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he traded it with the mayorate for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The mayor was forced to accept because otherwise she might put the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about 100 crowns per month for housing.
Households will have to pay a supplement from January onwards not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will therefore have to draw from their purse from January to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, gas almost 2 per cent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to one tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to reach the 100 crowns for households in apartments annually more than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices due to sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas is increasing moderately but of course at a time when people need the most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred extra crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, changing the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns more per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the people of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent is being prepared for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the pagoas they will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be one of the lowest in comparison to the whole country.
In Northern Bohemian, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Byty, which owns Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
Regular rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children are feasting on rum and Fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whiskey are stolen from parents.
They are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet 15 years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases of admissions from hospitals' children's departments.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk."
'The trend is really strong alcohols,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohême.
"When they manage to crack a bottle of papa in the wardrobe, it's sometimes whiskey but it's the fenet and vodka that prevails."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so do not feel it," says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for Motol Hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"Today is fashionable alcohol especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, he acted as a slivovice that they brought back from the house," said Jurinova.
According to the head of department Pélikan, seeing drunk children aged from thirteen to fourteen years at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol, where he had just ten years of pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolers around completely drunks.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She began her twelve-year career when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in blood with a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor said.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their out of common tolerance to the fact that their rejections are due to drinking, which is the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to the experts, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
"It's the so-called alcohol you hear a chronic addiction to alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that stem from it, but you don't find it in children."
"In the case of those who use repeated alcohol, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," said Chief of Department Pélikan.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, approximately forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe poisoning requiring hospitalization are integrated into the statistics.
Drinking children who are after emergency care returned to them by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, he exists according to Pelikan three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of the witches, the Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"It's either they drink after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of vacations."
"Of course I lived on the day of witches a single admission of 7 drunk children," said Pelikan.
The drunken child who spent the night in the detoxification hospital under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffered the day after the "wood mouth".
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are for this better lotis since they spend an excellent evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised at where they are," says Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to be paid for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can range up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drinking cost and that they could spend all summer working seasonally to repay one evening," said Pelikan.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover care-related expenses from parents, do not deal with the cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 planes are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M aircraft, took off on Tuesday in Seville, Spain, where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer was located.
This is the first time that such devices become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration thefts.
These are the two-way versions of the L-159T1 that were so far in service in the Czech army and were in a state of flight.
The remaining three devices are single-place versions of L-159.
They are currently staying at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the Omnipol firm - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody aircraft is for the moment unknown.
'The L-159 single-seater aircraft for the exchange have been taken on long-awaited aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 biplaces have been exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not be left out of two places, as the department signed an agreement with Aéro Vodochody in May 2009 worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four L-159 single places that were not used in two places.
The army took over the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, he committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the one taking into account L-159 aircraft is EADS and will be used for the training of pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to achieve this," Pajsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was signed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched an invitation to tender and has contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued that the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought and used 72 aircraft in Aéro Vodochody, which only 24 wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will likely have legal implications.
However, the European Commission filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because aircraft should have been selected as part of a European call for tenders and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken the delivery of three Casa planes, the latter should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the ring is a low risk of cancer
Men who have the longer index than the ring is exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the hormone male testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men before 60 years old," proclaimed the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer at Warwick University.
In this way, the finger could help determine which men should submit to the prostate cancer test, including by combining genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
Over the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right hand index shorter than the ring.
For them and for the 19 percent of those with the same length fingers, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the longer index than the annular the risk fell to 33 percent, for men before 60 years the risk decrease reached 87 percent.
The length report of the two fingers cited - trained during the prenatal period - indicates, inter alia, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that testosterone helps to develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is in the snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czechia as most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, most of the time there was compact snow, the deblazers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno towards Prague is the same fate.
The Dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st km, a truck was injured, at the 93th, two heavy loads were injured, and the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also found themselves in the ditch.
The problems are also on Highway D1 at 185 km to Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers are expected to leave just after Brno at 190 km or go to Brno and then enter 182 km to Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters of thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines are created, for example, in Prosek, the Sterboholska Street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Tramways take a delay, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and the Peace Place (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the state of Prague crisis must meet again.
Railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech railways have already had to delete because of snow 7 quick links.
The lines such as Prague in Kralupy or Prague in Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. in the night until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but redoubled with vigilance.
On the Vyskov road, three lateral roads are impracticable, on the Brno road it begins to be there by snowflakes and on the Blansko road the lines are required to pass some channels of communication in the places above.
The Vyskov region has been one of the most affected places.
To date the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
In order to clean them, it may be necessary to send snow-dryers and strawberries.
We can't estimate when they're rolling.
On the road to Hodonin caution is rigorous in the region of the white Carpathians.
On roads that are, in view of the protection of nature, maintained only by the sprinkling of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 cm of snow warning CTK.
In Chechnya, it fell between two and ten centimeters of snow; it fell the most in Northern Bohemian, with often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snowing gradually disappeared in Czechia.
Americans have a new "intelligent weapon"
The U.S. Army sent to Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon, known only as the code XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic gun will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and will "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super specific cannon
Its projectiles are driven by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm-calibre munitions developed for this rifle and containing a highly smashing explosive, actually work like small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
So you can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a gap.
Neither is it protected from above and when it falls upon a deadly rain of steel bursts, it can also put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it primarily in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, obtains a specific target point, according to which he corrects his target site and supports the relaxation.
"Say you've targeted 543 meters."
"When you press the relaxation, the weapon loads and pulls at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters, Audette said.
400 job relocations
The Fujitsu Group relocates its Bad Homburg subsidiary to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their workplace that is currently located at the Place Mareinbader office building in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates his branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday by the giant specialized in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the 400 men and women's workplace, located so far on the Marienbader Square of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street of the Niederrad District of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, the group should bring together 100 other jobs still scattered in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. Also, Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the working methods of employees.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure."
He claims that connection to the airport is of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region has yesterday caused the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The economic affairs officer of the Municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of establishment".
Fujitsu suits the city and its implementation is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg's mayor, Mr. Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer facing the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding that an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and dancer of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the City Hotel Place building, used so far by Fujitsu and the neighbouring "small vertical" company, as well as the rest of the Marienbad Square buildings, was part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
Fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the train station and the city hotel. It raises many criticisms, not only because of the impressive design of the surfaces that used to be part of the parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company of notation and investment advice, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, moved to the buildings.
In 2006, the German Group of Frankfurt Specialist Immobilien-Chancen purchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu along with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group, located in Tokyo, sees itself as the world's third largest IT supplier.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
His branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This 20-year-old complex, whose name reminds us of its star-shaped plan, is home to, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electronic Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently stayed in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks is attacked with increasing force.
The cyber-activist group " Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted until now in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom" indicated on Wednesday (local time) cyber activists at the origin of revelations via the Twitter social network.
Not long ago, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Following the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent to take care of people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
CNN, citing Mr Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation of Senator Joe Lieberman's employees.
The president of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this action earlier in view of Wikileaks' previous publications of classified information," the honourable senator said.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner. In doing so, it endangers our national security and endangers life all over the world," said an independent senator.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is listed by Interpol.
According to information broadcast by the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has constantly described as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions brought against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats have been reported against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly afraid of his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Herafnsson was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that those responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Chief of Government advisor Stephen Harper stated ironically on television that Mr Assange should be "killed" and that Mr Obama could "use a Drone".
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for the U.S. President, Barack Obama, described himself as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and released quite recently, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government now completely passes to the test bench the protection of its databases.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed to deal with the leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for setting up "the necessary structural reforms" made essential after the disclosure of the diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the whole administration exchanges and protects the information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to deal with the security of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the spokesperson of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to protect them if necessary."
The University of Glace
At the "Gelato University" of Bologna, ice confectioners are being prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German, the slightly outdated ice confectioner, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The ice turbine removes ice cream from the refrigerator using a spatula and then starts selling it.
To find out, we don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice can't avoid "Gelat-University" from the Italian company Carpigani.
The sorbetters manufacturer founded the ice university in 2003 so that the ice creams released from its machines correspond everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extended for several days. Also, practical sessions are held in private ice-cream.
In the middle of the 40th crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk themselves to realize their burning desire for smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, Brazil, to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of artistic education from California is proud of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose in future a quality European product in the country of industrial ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business advisor and she wants, after a few years, to draw a few things out of this challenging profession for nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children loved Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
It is decisive not only the good taste, but also the silky flexibility and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats up to 85 degrees by means of an electronic program, and then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it produces a pasteurized base white cream, based on all kinds of milk ice.
The trainer is immediately called into question: Is it possible to make ice by using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free courses to personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
The one who only speaks of ice-cream "manufactured from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, such as guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is of course possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will crack nothing but ice granules.
Certain changes in the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients acquired in the fruit or confissory ray of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to fill you with dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Be in the fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
It is in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when added to cocoa powder, constitutes the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four types of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and walnuts with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from taste point of view, this is not absolutely better.
The hazelnut ice does not necessarily contain the taste of the nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly reflects the taste of an ice," says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation exercise: if you use pure fishing with a lot of sugar, the quantity of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (the vines use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it unictucious and brought to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, light panels are not excluded.
Brazil's Gustavo has a hump of fresh fruit from the head to the feet and thus crushes his study comrades when the control of the colossal bowl blender escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that an "incident such is likely to occur in each course: it's only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experimentes with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has drowned the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered as an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Munich M. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the president of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has collaborated decisively in the development of the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements developed correspond, by paragraph, to the position taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the trade mark of the industry which, in substance, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking member of the Ephesus recently joined the Swiss food group Syngenta without condition or transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
A short time ago, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the control authority of the European Union and the industrial lobby, which has awakened the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency and of Members of the European Parliament.
However, Ephesus does not admit any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Ephsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (International Life Sciences Institute) based in the United States.
This body considers itself to be a neutral forum comprising experts belonging, inter alia, to science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feed test and the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know, for example, what the impacts of genetically modified corn are on the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all genetically modified plants, which do not allow reliable results.
"If you don't look for risks, how can you find them?" asked Mr. Then about your accuser.
That's also Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region and in the United States, and now in Europe as well, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "industry controls security research."
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell searched for it, a total of about 400 kilos.
Monday afternoon, she was standing at Stuttgart Station with her tube on her back.
There was something wrong with it.
He was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish much of the north wing.
Stuttgart's world was no longer the same: Several thousand people have demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into a underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was ruined when the demonstrations led to the cessation of construction work.
It's broken into 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse paved wall built badly between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He's been looking for a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically states: "a modest, cheap, simple, land-based rock."
He claims that in cutting her to the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do about this fragment yet.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
the traces of Stuttgart stones lead to a former deposit of French army munitions in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is selling old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were defeated or disappeared in the landfill," he said in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He said he was insulted and threatened when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolition company.
But he negotiated for full days with the adversaries of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything to oppose demolition.
And if it does, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently carried one of the approximately 80 kilograms heavy stone parallelepids, worth between 6,50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory at all times, also hoping to be able to render it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of them are still stuck in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscaped gardeners, Particuliers.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could enter the trunk and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or into limitations of grass-bands.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"in the summer this political component."
He enters his car all over the land, is the tower of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did legal studies that he had abandoned, and later he began studying biology before becoming subsequently interested in computer science and finally becoming a career.
And a stone amateur.
The stock is 40000 tons.
He grew up treasure all over Germany.
He claims he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's coming back.
Wooded sandstones with art are placed on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that climbs through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: red sandstone, previously, part of Karlsruhe train station.
And so on.
"Joli travertin."
The parallelepiped was once part of the gallery of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the prefecture of police, the red granite from the cathedral of St. Blasien, the tuf from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that at the time the stones were sculpted by hand and moved with simple sticks and carts drawn by oxen, he became quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put in place."
He didn't become rich, even less expensive.
But today this career employs 14 people. Also, stone makers, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's gratifying," says the waste recycler.
Right away, he's going to Cologne.
There too, there are stones to save.
Skillful struggle to conquer the high potential
The counter knows a great deal.
16 students scramble to buy small salmon bread, tomato sauce and white-foods.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen automobile manufacturer invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a sort of contest of ideas, they need to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to identify better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruiting the most skilled graduates in amphitheatre before they arrive on the job market and are not shortened by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about their students' performances, they try to identify exceptional talents in practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group loves talents.
A young maid of the staff service shares the stamps, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs to young talent; she shows them the ways to access the group's institute.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industry and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can get to know the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who are in line as a collaborator."
According to Mr Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive with which we're trying to attract the students.
"In the past, the focus was rather on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much closer.
In sector goods, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a kyrielle of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and, above all, shorten the highly skilled workforce.
It is mainly The graduates from the engineering courses who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI's forecast, the vacuum for engineering stations will still expand.
Roman Dykta goes to talent hunting on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting expertise and counseling.
It organizes costly talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise, a kind of rally-paper where competitors need to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year so that they can travel through the United States in this way.
Participants can visit KPMG subsidiaries and know the company.
The participant shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter that Mr. Dykta is, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have been in contact with all those who participated in similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct softening on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a very classic way by participating in professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We're trying to reach the graduates by participating in the trade fairs."
"For example, at the Solar Technology Fair," said Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company located in Bonn employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe is aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 posts are being competed on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacant positions."
"It costs money and takes a lot of time," does it?
Another way to establish contact is through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with different higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional internships or to write his final project at home."
Onerous advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"A large group often can't do that," said Mrs. Stübe, chief of staff.
A long time ago, money no longer played a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld occupies 55th place among Germany's top 100 employers.
The Institute is an annual board of honour for German employers.
To this end, he asked the employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and their context while looking at employee framework conditions.
The Chief of Staff, Ms. Stübe, hopes that this placement will increase the image of the company with job seekers.
"I believe that candidates will focus on external assessments of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this first means taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to get attractive is to go through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When they deal well with their employees and identify with the company, they only advertise their employer to their friends and knowledge.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama brakes new oil drills
There will be no new oil drillings in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, Southeastern United States, in the coming years.
The Government of Washington has issued a ban An equivalent ban and thus definitively annulled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drillings remain banned for the time being.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement Wednesday.
It was the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that led to this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this accident that cost 11 employees life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize new drillings in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries on oil supply.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastatement of the black tide in golf is not, to date, finally resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing multi-billion claims for compensation, is at the heart of the charges.
An investigation committee created by Obama must present its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze from the prescribed drilling after the platform explosion.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter safety instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently being thoroughly reformed.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that they would remove the lucrative tax niches from gas and oil groups.
The players in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than has been so far.
"The aim of the government is to put a stop to rapid growth in the gas and oil sector" as a result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm prior to the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
In fact, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to new order, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is brown oiled; it exhibits a smell similar to that in the petrol station: Due to a leak, billions of gallons of crude oil destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live on theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't exhaust yourself," the environmental activist launches to the journalists to calm them: "You still have enough oil mud today in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man trapped in muddy water to the chest, as well as the thick trench around him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the burst of water in the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is full of brown crude oil.
On the shores of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom said that she was collecting shrimps by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have been completely dry.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil poured into a pipeline that exploded in the vast tide.
Fishermen live in the small neighbouring town of Bodo now have to come down for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The country Ogoni located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All the extent of the devastation leaps to the eyes as mangrove marshes pass through watercourses.
Instead of clear water, the motor boat finds a brown creek water. Anyone who dives his hand takes it off all covered with oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the soil like bars. The isolated palm trees leave their palms sadly hanging.
We are looking for bird clouds in vain, as we usually meet in wetlands: As long as the off-board engine stops, a fantastic silence falls on this old paradise that looks like a service station by the smell it sheds.
"What's happening here is war on the environment," said Mr. Celestine Akpobari with sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent health hazard."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where Ogoni lives has been a battleground for tens of years: over 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organised in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to Ogoni country is banned: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are untapped because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred meters walk into the water of steel truffles as bizarre sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are rubbed by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks into pieces from time to time as a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres of oil has been poured on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to the amount of oil passed through the sea during the accident of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution?The answer to this question divides the actors.
For Shell, oil pipeline sabotage and syphoning are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider drilling heads explosions and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell group of applying essentially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the driving failures rate is "even higher than allays".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of camouflage and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with cambouis up to the neck.
A spark fire under one of the many tonnes that are sometimes connected to pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
We've been heating crude oil in the barrel for several hours, Michael, the team leader.
In the first instance, the gasoline penetrates into a receptacle by passing pipes, then, at the end of the kerosene drop drive, and eventually the diesel is obtained.
This is how Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre Diesel barrels daily: "This brings us 34 000 Naira", about 22 dollars.
The people of Delta are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price less than the ridiculously low 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: because they buy their raw materials free of charge.
It is provided by the "protectors" that put the pipeline network in perce throughout the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small, insignificant part of the provisionally stored raw material is unlawfully purified: Organized crime networks that also include high-ranking politicians and military members, load the lion's share in tankers and strike it on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the mode of lax production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the fishermen's life were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refinery."
But in the meantime, the Ogoni's relations, especially with Shell, have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of withdrawing the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, may be better off."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a long time for you to degueril" announces the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If illegal refiners are caught by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at the most they will offer them pots of wine.
Even the soldiers mostly from the north of the country intend to enjoy as all Nigerians of raw material.
"At any rate, this piece of shit has dropped our country very low," says Akpori.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
When examining an emergency landing device, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "a catastrophic reactor failure."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the Quantas company were visibly more likely: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of certain A380 devices presented a serious security problem, and it warned against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could result in serious consequences: It can cause fatigue creams and leaks at the oil pipeline connection level, it is indicated in a position published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
She could have led to a catastrophic failure of the reactors.
The reactors made of Rolls-Royce and equipped 20 aircraft in the A380 series are concerned.
The Quantas Airbus, which had to land as a matter of urgency on November 4 in Singapore, is one of them.
The Australian airline has now initiated judicial proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against society.
The Director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, said his company would claim damages in respect of the incident in early November.
Parts moved apart and the bearing surface was damaged during engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that causes damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbos that are also equipped with relevant reactors.
Safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his aircraft, the Quantas airline had immobilized its entire fleet of A380 for a week on the ground.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
The Lufthansa company replaced, by precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the world's largest liner.
Snowfall across the territory causes chaos in transport
All white-covered Germany: In one night, the snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter makes Germany grelotte: Nearly the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is heavily restricted on several highways and many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they were not able to come to the end of the snow that had stopped accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects this to take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snowmas on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the weather warning plant Meteomedia announced the level of violet alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
By places, there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars stayed stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxe-Anhalt land, police authorities announced serious road disturbances.
On Highway A2, snow and wind caused a disruption of traffic and caused plugs.
In Thuringe, snowfalls affected highways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious rail traffic disturbances occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees falling on the railways, canisters or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, we had to interrupt interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt his trip.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers of the train in blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds have swept the roads.
The snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at the major airports in Germany.
According to a standard spokesperson and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service there.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, although barely 400 beds have been made available.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
On the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Because of the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made a ton on a sliding shoe in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will torbillonn in the case of light breaths.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be overwhelmed by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to at least 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for her twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to news reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring up to EUR 500 million.
The Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's seat: The twin tours in the Business Quarter have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
The financial group now clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and seeks a buyer for its two buildings, as written in the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper, citing a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not state the reasons for the intended sale.
He said "we will check whether it is more interesting to take care of the buildings or to sell them, and to re-allocate them later."
Thus the largest financial institution in Germany has already surrendered its headquarters shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for a sum of EUR 272 million to own-fund holders, and then they were rehabilitated.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization have included, according to some indications, approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of tours, renamed in the meantime "Green Turs", to about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is currently not known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the children who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for buried minors who were reported dead following several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to go back to the bodies because the security situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the dead pit, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and the other explosions that followed, no relief team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors no longer had a chance to survive.
So far the bodies could not be raised.
Today, parents and friends have organized a memorial feast for the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried minors, we installed 29 tables on which we could see the names, helmets and lamps.
Personal photos and effects, including clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were placed in front of all the public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants at the commemorative party that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that minors will return to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, stated that he cannot resign to accept his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' parents, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin were also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescuers started putting out a fire inside the coal mine on the South island of New Zealand.
Police prefect Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas masses are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic from the fighter.
What audience could the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought about shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his assortment and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his adversaries after each other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses methods of brutal murder. When he is in bad mood, he removes the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be killed.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the band says no words on its real name. Even the other characters let escape, at least, at the back of one or two sentences a few cry of hideous agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and feast in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be more ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travels.
When a film targets several target groups, it is unfortunate that they exclude each other.
Since the release of "Pusher", the director Winding Refn has been considered his trilogy of the peacock drug dealer, full of style, as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the current dominant or introduce a little less brutality to the art and test cinema.
Most art cinema sympathists must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and to the intestines.
Lovers of action films die of boredom, when the burgundy embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to shut up.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" found no film distributor in Germany and that there is only DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a exciting film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a fiebrous dream transformed into film.
The spectator can't escape it.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a lugurous soundtrack, but especially with unexhaustible hate that tears out of the heart of characters.
Only a blond boy, who faithfully stands by the burgundy, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything else, the bourgeois hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allys by becoming warriors, may be sent from the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, nothing but for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims to anger, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious terrace work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications concerning a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a stand on this subject, even less subject to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007 - midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building in Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometres away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is contained in IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria has built, it seems, with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepipe, concealed in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing on U.S. intelligence services, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring town, el-Kibar, would be well able to produce plutonium, which would enable the manufacture of atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video with blurred satellite images.
Through the computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the power plant that represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building nearby, even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, little more information is available than at the time, and even in time, the mystery is growing.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at El-Kibar, but had little evidence showing that country developed "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "prosumed reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation to be "opusable".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as IAEA.
Asked how he made sure he dealt with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic reply in summer, stating that IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly hurriedly removed the debris of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical settlement of the land.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinnen discovered in El-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, IAEA has received from a Member State satellite images from commercial providers showing the moment when the attack was directly followed. It seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damas argues that uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But IAEA rejected this argument after analysis of particulate matter by calling it inexhaustible.
Since then, ladies have refused any discussion on this, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refuse access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister-in-Office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
This is how the investigation into this case has been carried out in length since June 2008 without a result and that it "is becoming increasingly a serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, is ultimately a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that in order to achieve progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
Until now, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities they are dealing with here, what their function or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known in the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as the neighbouring cities.
Washington's Independent Institute for Science and International Security identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be in a military base or directly next to it; that is precisely why Syria refuses access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is an intelligence provided by American secret agents that attracts the attention of nuclear inspectors.
IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "use fuel production".
There would be "no indications concerning sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there is a strong plausible hypothesis about the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come from and where plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb would later be separated.
It is not known whether the tapes, which could hide high-value traces, were stored in all three sites.
When hundreds of land trucks have disappeared, no one will have any information on the place of storage of the rags.
For IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see if it could agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
By analyzing recent photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos, however, show that Syria has undertaken landscaping at the three suspected and displaced sites of huge containers when IAEA begins to demand access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to rule out suspicion.
In the diplomatic circles, it is said that IAEA spent several months in developing a plan on inspections to be carried out there, which would enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only time spent shows how much interest the inspectors have in this case.
In the meantime, Damascus also denied this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the reactor's destruction, the emergency would not be reported for this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador who has been referring for a few months to what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to carry out its controls.
The Director of IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation become apparent.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives thought to: "It would be useful, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Wartime
It's bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut in summer as a director.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but that's enough to cause the malaise.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian ass during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some planned shooting sequences in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continued in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war has sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and has demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is a good-will ambassador to UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she proposed that these women meet with them in Hungary, but these women declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says enough about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for the removal of the good-will ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But in fact, what kind of Jolie scenario did she write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted some hesitations a shooting authorization to Sarajevo, but we do not know why it did not then come despite this authorization.
The young author herself ensures that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she has made to the Yugoslav conflict, and she argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all stakeholders to express herself.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew themselves well before the war began. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
Which is still a big difference with the version "a victim of rape is made up of his ass."
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, as Jolie expresses herself, is "unjust and based on misinformation".
Now only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario in the Net, as many others have before.
Let's get out of here!
It's all right with the Irish again tonight.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overpowers visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans cry out of joy at the bottom of a strong music, kicking their feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in southern Ireland vibrate due to players launching and succeeding in dropping table tennis balls at a distance of three metres in beer goblets of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "bière-pong". The winner hits 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend the World Cup championship in Las Vegas in January.
Cyan Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computerist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn away from the tender question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in its projects. In January, it will conduct hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"But I feel a strange feeling," he says.
"The country of birth is so far away and I have no employment."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she has won her desired job as an evental project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Because of the country's dark prospects, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin is now in a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people are leaving: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicated that 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even predict a number of 200,000 migrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are achieved, it will be a current of emigration comparable to the one Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have enjoyed great ease, grief is now taking all the place.
The economic crisis, however, affects particularly well-trained Irish youth, who have known so far only moments of happiness.
Loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper quite a bit publishes the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes to the drift."
"There should be a rise against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity, leaves and our country so a whole generation."
"The last one to leave turned off the light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a darker future because the government only throws it out of the eye and offers no prospect of the future for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades crumble from one practical internship not paid to another.
She states that it is her greatest concern to emigrate within four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to positively address this theme.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" show, which provides full support on the theme "Working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," he says.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gale, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to be done in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house just came out of land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional post of work, in order to be able to repay the credit contracted to build his home in the home country.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live almost no longer."
He burst out of an awkward laugh through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-maintained front gardens, expensive cars of large brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, 100% financed by credit.
"These were times of madness, no doubt, the money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid to see everything go down because of credit?
O'Donovan reflects a moment, tightens hot tea and says: "I don't have kids to entertain and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The engineer of the building does not like the regrets he has often heard in recent times.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island," he said.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not what can get worse, maybe it's what makes us feel Irish at first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life is going on elsewhere.
In his pocket, He already has a few years of work in London. That is why life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that concerns him well in recent days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's worried she can't turn into a farewell night.
"Only not a lot of emotions," he says by drinking a long glass of beer.
"Adieu, it seems still worrying."
"Let's call it a good-bye night, all relaxed, bringing together some friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey in September and early October.
The first is the pretty sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries over the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy improved after having experienced a strong decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, thus reducing the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of the respondents in the region said they were satisfied with how their country's democracy worked in practice, with the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Graph 3)
Some 34 per cent said they had confidence in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a significant increase from 2003 (respectively 17 per cent and 24 per cent).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
If this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a brief recession and received considerable recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin American people living in poverty had increased only slightly in 2009 and again declined to 32 per cent this year.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
Some 31% say that they or their loved ones have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is falling compared to 38% last year and has been the lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even though their left-wing president Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, down by 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country in distress and plunged into fear.
Votes were presented and a new vote was held, ballot papers were dispersed in the gutters, polling stations and intimidation.
The polling stations were open late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who had been displaced following the January earthquake, had gone to the vicinity to find out where to vote.
Some of them eventually quit.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, have denounced the fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations high official in Haiti, sees the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community prudently stated that they did not "believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are accountable to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second expected tour is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, an old first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no perceptible support for the electors, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tor will reach the second round.
With an angry cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In the event, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, has received a wave of public sympathy that has improved its approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%; this has been her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, transforming this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fernández, evidently in mourning, according to which she would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income on will.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has soaked in the disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist Movement in power joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers and others accused the corruption government), Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even more room for manoeuvre to spend on will.
The economy is largely overheated: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and wage claims from trade unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, gave priority to growth and poverty reduction rather than to inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and deployed the INDEC, the statistical office, which made forgery of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now modify these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded growth rate rate after a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms Fernández showed signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with the bondholders that had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not fixed its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditors governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it is owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always stressed that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of the Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which resembles a prelude to the consolidation of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether Ms Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which kirchnerism is highly recommended.
When the Argentines returned from their summer vacation to Mars, the wave of sympathy for it would have flowed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to reject her husband's many policies without noise.
Half an hour for China
Taiwanese voters are heading towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What do Taiwan think of her big brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million electors were present on November 27, or 70% of the eligible people, to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings over the continent, having created innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the greatest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma did the test, but that's right.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) won three of the five mayorates, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has focused on full independence of Taiwan, has won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT of 45%.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including tapping trucks and mass gathering flags with girls who danced in minimal clothing.
An attempt at mandatory mysterious murder has also been carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A crowd man shot young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, has had consequences for the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates have played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from sharpening the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to attract Taiwan, back to the beach.
China has not lost time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start with the beginning.
Better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP was reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, it was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison following charges of corruption.
He was a challenger for explicit independence from 2000 to 2008.
But a new generation of moderates has been under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a candidate of the DPP for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their departure is doing their best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr.Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be exaggerated by this change.
In a statement issued from its cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic one, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have difficulty choosing between its potential candidates.
KMT must introspect itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were low; despite vertigo economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
A spokesperson from the KMT said that his office and his local antennas would be remodeled.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for reconciliation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards Nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
To do so at the request of a president, and people are required to get acquainted with it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer picked up by President Obama for his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a big appointment in the category "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a very famous figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album "Esperanza", the appointment remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of Grammy Awards that an artist should not exit more than three albums before recording; this "sets the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skilled hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one line pointed at Spalding compared to the fulcruming success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Awards voters taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
In addition, the Grammy Awards voters have rightly honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "toolal album" category, a turn on a revigorating frisson of a record that was one of the first favourites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positotly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition in particular.
Trombone Shorty, in favor of the raucous voice of New Orleans and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme", was honored in the category of contemporary jazz; which is also strongly leaning towards a certain fusion with Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret Society of the wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, earned some well-deserved recognitions in the great class; in competition with the rich camera-jazz by Billy Children Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a good example of the democratic hand of this bassist as group leader.
Grammy Awards Nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic appointments for the 53rd Grammy Annual Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations, we mention Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony #4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in high school for a reward.
The classic appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - l'art des Castroti" features various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" of Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choeur of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoe" of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition include Pärt for Symphony #4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had its first in the Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was appointed for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that he soon wrote the work of 15 minutes especially for the interpreter at the Avi Avital Mandoline, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms from North Africa," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez received an appointment in the category of orchestra benefits, for having led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who have been appointed, we mention the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organizer Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year there are only vocalist-solist nominees; here are Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixtures, soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for his registration "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque Project wins approval from the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Criticism has taken over the project by claiming that it promotes both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the Commissioners decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahaïs, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as an American citizen."
"She shows that justice takes it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, at the speaking time of approximately equally divided, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the journal's website.
"There is no more America," wrote one speaker.
"It's another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also protested in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, where the attacks of 11 September 2001 took place in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmush denounced violence in Temecula Valley.
Its congregation of 135 co-existed families in Riverside County for years, but it wanted a space bigger and better than the warehouse it rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque with the Mediterranean style architecture would consist of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4,32 hectares site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents may still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating the arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That is why she is very special, even though she is far from being a truly "foreign" way of life," said Paul Davies C. W. of the University of State of Arizona, co-author of the report in the Thursday online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing the phosphorus with the arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other global environments, organizations could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the replacement of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"The arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is different enough so it doesn't work exactly like the phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow tires the work of our biochemical machine," explained Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with the phosphorus but the fact that it can live with the arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of arsenic life can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where the arsenic is most frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Deputy Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that the arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of Earth's existence, she said; thus, researchers have assumed that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not only the way that life on Earth was formed at first," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institute.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two dogs of exposure on four flights outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of Los Angeles County announced him Thursday.
The four exposure dogs - two akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they spent the night outside a Bellflower motel, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening on Wednesday, Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the department of the sheriff of Los Angeles County, said.
"The good news is that dogs are doing well," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, what neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't mean it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in an animal shelter in Downey County.
The sheriff's deputies found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female, were healthy and safe, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of Long Beach's "AKC/Eukauuba" national championship, where they were planning to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other events scheduled in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC/Eukauba", Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and guard their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaghetti - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They have a little window open so the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck flight at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would give a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward has been awarded Thursday.
The lion is ready to roar again, the restructuring of MGM no longer awaits the final green fire of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start again in zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially rented the "prepacked" plan on Thursday by creditors that about $5 billion of the debt would be cleared; opening the way for the entertainment company, having 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With the decision of Thursday, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no more legal obstacles remain before MGM to float under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be an alleged studio.
The staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has established a $500 million credit facility to finance MGM's new operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio restructuring process began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was initiated to advise management on how to place its finances because it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, Director General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy more than 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company on sale at the end of 2009.
However, the sale of auctions attracted few bidders among whom none of them was willing to pay the additional 2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again when the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially fails in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have collected $375,000 per month for their company's management services, will receive a "primary of success" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch MGM's production, which only released one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which Peter Jackson has to make.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget balanced
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jumpstrings, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget balanced.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholeale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technology toy is likely to have more strength; while at the same price or a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known ones, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the buttons toys are increasing, as well as the rechargeable toys.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise specified.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are toys of the size of a pig in India who sing a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start supporting, you can no longer stop.
To combine the dance song, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays round-the-clock games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child from the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a back bag filled with questionnaire playing cards designed to transform a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve scorer.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for the 3-8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for the 3-12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes type system to provide games and e-books and is equipped with a SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of hardly five blocks larger than a box of matches, each having its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impumtu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 years) that includes a marked piece of a hidden code.
When you purchase the code online, your child receives enough credit at Club Penguin store for two items at a time of choice.
It can be roulette skates or a pet toy Puffle.
slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the last micro-robots to stack button.
The false beastile moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a drop in the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to the maintenance of order in China
Tang Shenbin was planning a place in the city as an urban sergeant for training by severely inspecting his nerve loads, casting low orders with a military authority.
He wanted the women members of Kenya - those responsible for public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and for violence - to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Stand straight!"
"Be lousy!"
Show them, he says, "What do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely spent their teens in white gloves, dressed in identical jackets and trousers of olive color, were looking at your guard.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, in line with the rule.
Four hats perfectly brushed to the top of the hair tied by a striped knot in blue and white.
"I personally think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with dedication.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
A city has demanded that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
Guangdong province has exchanged grey-green uniforms against a more demanding blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced them with the strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had circled an uncontrollable snack trolley by launching black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the Colporteur packed his affairs and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to perform a major image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban area of 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, yellow and young.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have difficulties to draw attention to this underground urban brigade of China
And for that reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them while scattering a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing, unobtained and online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastry carrier was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game impregned with violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained at the assault of street vendors.
"Chenguan has marked the government," lamented China Daily last year, a national publication, after a huge controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real complete cleaning."
Skeptics say the approach is far from that.
After the district released an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real jobs or whether they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The District announcement required female candidates between 18 and 22 years of age to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in the right order."
They must have an average size greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is mandatory.
The officers stated that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of candidates will determine whether they are suitable; this is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperature and the "internal qualities."
The Chenguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of the facial features.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or with disabilities should not apply.
"We cannot let a person who boxes or a boss come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has the apple toys with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the enhancement of her appearance to be gender-based, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" did she ask for a messy air.
Xu Yang, his colleague at the woods of 21 years of age, said: "Our job is to present the city's image."
They did not oppose their mandate being limited, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into streets where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen walkers who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as much bread or tofu bowls as possible before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We have already told you many times!" said Mrs. Xu, while a vendor ran away on foot, temporarily leaving his bicycle-carlet at noodles.
Officers describe their functions as monotonous rather than hard.
"It's about the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20 years old, studying marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposures of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after the spread of false rumors that the Hungarian agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and police officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were shot down or burned.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks of placid houses Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike raised the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, on their left face, broke a elbowed path towards their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, male coordinators who are 40 years of age or older are merely supportive.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li.
"Most of the time, the public starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice lifted the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case related to a former campaign assistant and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the woman's husband, announced on Wednesday the Senator's lawyers.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential office until the scandal around his case did not do the big national titles last year and harm his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very happy" by the decision, the result of a one-year survey.
The honourable senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to keep any charges against him in this case."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a surprise to many lawyers of ethics outside the Ministry of Justice that there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the honourable senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a member of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole for a year.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seemed in contradiction with the so-called lobbying door ban.
According to evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and a substantial violation of the law of the turning door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from an investigation by the government.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the department seemed to be suspicious of political prosecution after a number of high-level reversals by its section of public integrity, including the decision taken last year to leave the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of failure to prosecute.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the general director of the citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Senior Counsel of Mr. Ensign, stated in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor in the Department of Justice on Monday and followed up the following day, saying that the department was not looking for charges against its client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as her office reaffirmed in a statement on Wednesday, "have acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made at the prosecutor's office.
"I am not comfortable with entering into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hampton violated federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was all except a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the Senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martelized" the Ministry of the Interior on a question in dispute.
Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after committing Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When news of the case came to the surface last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to issue a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were taping away in the courtroom ranks.
They sent out horrible testimony reports every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape case and children who were in bed in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end to which the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed elements in the court that outline appeals, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is causing, is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "cirque atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury was badly influenced by public passions.
The request could lead the appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms undermines the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ulmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, has laconically rejected the claims in the judgment rendered last week, claiming that the media were "sugly controlled" and there was no evidence that the jury would have been excited by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the question.
Courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court annulled the condemnation of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere in the trial " because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "Le fugitif".
Some lawyers stated that the appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication of the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue claims that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from courtrooms could allow for more fair trial.
The case of Twitter is one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, likely to be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre pictures of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some jurors reported being horrified by victims' photos, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years old.
The defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge has unfairly expelled one of the jury, who had been criticized by the prosecutors, and that he has abused the pressure for a verdict by taking the unusual decision to bring the jury to a debate on a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates in the position of Governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media did not cease to extinguish the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily broadcast of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "did not resemble anything that had been seen here before in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the new snapshots were more incendiary than the press releases submitted more slowly was a luddicated view that would weaken the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that appeals were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 that had overturned Dr Sheppard's conviction because of media coverage of the trial and they specified that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, representing that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can civilization approach the cleavage?
After a campaign marked by invectiveness and negativity, a minimum of civilization broke out in Washington this week.
Is this an early sign of genuine bipartisan cooperation towards the front or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not produce any insight into the major issues to be dealt with during the session of the "boxy duck".
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points. void of partisan notation.
The Commission's public meeting on the President's deficit on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap; but that still divides the members.
It is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of testing and testing each other for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxation, spending, health care or rights, both sides remain at thousands of distances.
Yet, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
Elections give rise to partisan passions and then collapse.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "boxy duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or whole, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is envisaged on the extension of unemployment allowances, because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers without employment.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is planned on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "boxy duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warned that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lame Duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"Once the things that must be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between today and 2012 as a pre-play or shadow-boxing compared to the main event in 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the Chamber and to the electors present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, reposing the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, they themselves, have imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching this number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected representatives; this suggests that there are at least few reasons or compromises on tax issues today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fights between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first year will come next in the form of partisan confrontations, given that the Republicans are challenging Obama's budget, taxes and health care; then being followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans always want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
The one who will be judged to be lost will have to change his mind and find compromises.
But it would, however, be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, both party activists see 2010 as a simple prelude to a larger election in 2012.
In view of this reality, this week's exposed civilization could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common ground on the issues that divide them again.
Divulged American Documents portray Moscow as a Harbor of Corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and makes up to Kremlin some of the pots and the protection money it collects, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes part while the money moves upwards of the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been cleared.
It was written while Yuri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but since then there have been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the charges of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he said what follows a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupted: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to a overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupted; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy account; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and to assert that the government was more functioning as a kleptocracy than a government," according to the Embassy's note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (the term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means " roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as throughout the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts to identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas where the city does not provide some services."
The report indicates that the FSB is brewing money from the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The note points out that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their cases close on one pretext or another.
Medvedev mentioned several times the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The note of the embassy transmits reports of men carrying bags, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev is dependent on bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's think tank.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of a political class because it doesn't exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the costs of corruption would amount to more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey of the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note by the US Embassy, which was only realized yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly remove discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov could be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is being resolved.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin made the assumption that WikiLeaks' documents could be a fabrication and reacted angrily to the statements that U.S. diplomats had spread by calling him Batman and by bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem is based on the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that it would be realized with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Veterans of Khmer Rouges must face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor quality decrepit concrete walls, the director of the Anlong Veng high school mentioned the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouges, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer reds northwest of Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former troops of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, the long-standing loyalty is finally challenged to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, at 35 years in prison, the former chief of the sadly famous Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this development, anxiety has increased with the veterans of the Khmer Rouges of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their will to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are resentment and fear among the old Khmer reds but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overturned the Pol Pot-U.S. government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Red combatants began to defecate the government, culminating with the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had taken the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending trial.
Without their beneficiaries, most of the former Khmer Red veterans have sobbed in black poverty, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic to the movement.
Although some Khmer Red elite officers held their local leadership positions in return for depositing the weapons, they were unqualified farmers at low grade and low grade.
"These people received very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation that organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibe of the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They have been raised in a business environment is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as poor rice grower.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to meet our own needs."
The Khmer Rouge court in progress has also caused concern here.
At the beginning of next year, the court is expected to commence the judgement of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior leaders and the chief perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say whether he continued beyond these four cases.
It takes more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, 64 years old, former district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem came back from work in the field located near his wooden house on a pilot, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun was throwing long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer red.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had injured Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court pursued several suspects; although experts and historians contest this.
"Cambodge must dig a hole and bury the past, he says.
But dealing with the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces," he said.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, says Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he says.
Yet the Khmer red retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by the weeds and swarmed with plastic bags, leads up to a rectangle of black soy, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a tire pile after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31, a mobile phone vendor on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated at that place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people will go there to pray, she says.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, she planned to walk to the last place of rest of Pol Pot where she would leave a bouquet of mature bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its military quality uranium stock
The Belarus Government announced Wednesday that it was going to abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprising victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué published after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, on the margins of a Security Summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to renounce highly enriched uranium and appeared to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that certain classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military quality uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This opened the way for a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the remainder of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to a staff member who referred to the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Safety Summit, organized on the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to seek an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit.
"It proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for World Security, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton called the "very significant, important step" agreement by Belarus.
Obama committed to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material throughout the world over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarusian President, Alexandre Loukachenko, said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military quality uranium and low enriched uranium," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, it showed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated, and officials indicated.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and carried out by aircraft, according to the officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with less enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization have been implemented to strengthen confidence"; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a responsible for the Department of Energy Specializing in the Reduction of the Global Threat, said.
According to the estimates of the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military quality uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression of human rights by Loukachenko.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential for improving bilateral relations; and indispensable for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has not objected to CIA flights
The government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda towards Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in El País, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised adequate supervision of foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe that accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprising the Zapatero Government off the table" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid "taking them off the hook," Aguirre reports in a cable.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as she was in the hands of judges, the Government had limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Public Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to seek the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any criminal elements, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after talking to the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among the independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly among the Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the US Ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a burning rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has deliberately tolerated or ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the United States Government," she said.
The parricide that passed by was complaining in the network of "acquable" being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when she was already dead and she had a blog: "Terreur à la Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was small, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natives of Noia, the village of the Coruña that she originated with.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, we need to know about their sentimental life, which ABC built with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrial woman.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
He was Alberto, a young man from Lousam, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to sound the labour market, she stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the contents of his communications, it is understood that their idyllic fractured, they separated.
In March 2008, she was alone in Minorque and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and vexed for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed to him a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she had just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the boy with my mother, and I will take it when I return," she complains.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "I'm leaving this week, but I'm only going to stay there until 19, because I have to go to a job to not lose it."
She explains that if everything were all right, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him with another person if that person is not my mother", a questionable intention, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When she hit him, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, was allegedly murdered on the 10th of the month, died.
Caesar is happy on one side, but he's not.
"On one hand he's with me and he likes this place a little, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorque.
"There will be (the child) at a few hours of summer and like that I save some money from the baby sitter."
17, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you'll come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know which videos on the e-mail, you see, when he wants to, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is well, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "I'm moving forward with money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Galician Land (Epigrapher)".
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, declares her regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything had happened so that she hadn't told him that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial penitentiary of Palma yesterday, from the judicial detention centre in Minorque.
Official lawyer Carlos Maceda explained that she did not remember how things had happened, "and she didn't intend to hurt the minor either."
Before she had confessed to having drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited her body in a suitcase.
The defence and prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
Members of the Popular Party would earn 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and Members recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training obtains in these committees normally double the one it receives in Catalans.
For example, the Catalan populace received 610,473 votes at the generals in 2008, while at the 2006 autonomy they obtained 316,222 votes.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, a desire for a diversion of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, the analysts of this training have calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CIU would also win four (now 10) and PSC would lose no fewer than 9 MPs (at 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a Member - he has three now - while ICV would keep a Member or earn one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal committees, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relays to the head of the Barcelona General Council, one of the administrations that handles the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and the populace agree with the fact that CSP could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not get the majority either the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fantastic if this training lost its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes-.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP only recorded a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, including the mayor Ángel Ros, maintaining very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three detainees in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian officers held by officials of the General Police Information Station of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaida groups, including "Les Tigres pour la libération de la Terre Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of Bombay's attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that "the Kampai operation" has been "weak" the Al Qaida falsification device at the international level and therefore "its operational capacity".
The researchers estimate that within two years the cell was active in Catalonia, it was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that included the Al Qaida criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could pass the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why in the investigations they participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days of strikes similar to that recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), in Thailand another took place, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the leaders of the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - a part of which was hit in 2009 - was mainly stealing passports that met the conditions of the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
The investigators point out that until now no details have been found that connects prisoners in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, even though the author of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia a transfer agency sent a few miles of dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after the "command" integrants that killed 106 people.
The police seized a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas's conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and which resolves itself to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address in half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples has arrived at your meeting with Arthur Mas with the security that gives the result of having obtained 18 Members at the elections last Sunday, more than enough to be loved, because the candidate from Ciu requires at least one of the formations that the opposition will take away in the vote of the investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the time being, the talks that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are key to Catalan.
With regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "all sovereignist and independent discourses should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader converges even wishes to submit to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common betted them to undermine the political apparatus of a very exaggerated self-government and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the Mas investment negotiation will be taken care of by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrics claim that the deaths were not due to the "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot Centre do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The managers of the Geriatrics La Caritat d'Olot (Gérona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by Joan Vila Dilmaé's criminal behaviour, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people he was responsible for during the period he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by counsel from the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to execute the charge against the person responsible" for the dead but "law and responsibility compel us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social disqualification that the entity may suffer for failing to detect in time the criminal activities of the nurse at night, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day on he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - that he suspected in many cases that no doctor personally explored the deaths but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Through her director, Caritat categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can at no time have been the cause of what happened".
Lawyer La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an indication of recklessness on the part of any other person other than the accused."
The person already baptized as "the Angel of Death" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by injecting an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of central staff to doctors.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the infirmer, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila does not lie in saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or instead he burned them inside by giving them lessive as he already confessed he did with the three women he killed in the meantime 12-17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the night nurse's statements, nor does the number of murders confessed, eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change of how to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted suddenly yesterday to the threat of yesterday's Trichet that warned that "markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
The differentials of the peripherals were closed to force and the actions of the European banks suffered more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ability of the ECB to deceive ourselves, and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is a matter of concern.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but is motivated by short and very speculative closures.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB cited us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retreat for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary term liquidity measures and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" will be extended and will maintain the sale of unlimited access to quarterly auctions at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and that we will even signal its intensification.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be blind to withdraw the liquidity measures, may God help us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered purchasing bonds and that they had collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Last year's one-year trade auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basic points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
Figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short-term and 15,000 potential and have up to February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval from its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wishes to interpret Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday's plan of measures approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of deficit, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors' ears like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a three-year auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will be resolved with a strong demand and helps to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain requesting a Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million cash available, triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "aside from being, to appear."
Brave, we can get out of it!
The President of Eulen will contest Vega Sicilia's council requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it the "rule of law", El Enebro's judicial council on the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia firm.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to give up in his dispute to be present in El Enebro's governing bodies.
From its Board of Directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who were appointed directors at the Shareholders' Meeting on January 18 this year, whose contest is registered in the Register of Commerce and Corporations.
El Enebro's judicial council for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, reopened the tuna box within the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as "a desperate appeal of his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly violating the Law and by abusing the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically null on January 18th", according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly takes place, to be challenged, considering that it is "nothing of the right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group calls for the use of 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request for a dispute for which there is not yet a stated date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the ascending trajectory of recent seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all waged on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
The German Sebastien Vette, not to mention the ability of the Renault engine to drive its car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company has put into Red Bull's hands to transform it into a winning team.
In reality, this is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with far-reaching goals from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains for manufacturing plants all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, accurately simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding faults and avoidable costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's planes or the most famous commercial vehicles in Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, in charge of Siemens' industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce up to three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 high-skilled young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, are analysing and projecting all kinds of changes on bowling.
Siemens' leader explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull's bowling except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can shift from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the sole limitation of this madness of technological development, there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its bowling alleys in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty has 580 people, including two pilots, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 by Red Bull, probably, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the Energy Drinks brand has put in the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety is null.
The company's technology director, Steve Nevery, said five years ago it could be said that R+D's progress in racing cars made 50% of the wins and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of the success, while drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer, as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened in Barcelona his first exclusive store in collaboration with his associate Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 trade network between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice-president Helena Herrero gave as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to implement 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be affected in an interactive manner), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of trades claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pioneering pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connected with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already hired technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flight' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse of the margins of interest, which will try to compensate partially with increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to pick up in three years a million particular customers, his task to do.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011 the bank will launch a new master plan that will hold a three-year viability.
The objective, apart from survival without the need to use publicly available grants from FROB, is to gain a market share by the capture of one million new customers - 700,000 if those who can get out of the bank are deducted, its great task to do, because so far this bank has suffered more damage from SMEs and companies than the individual customer.
This year he picked up 250,000 customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is bet on productivity, or the same thing, of austerity, with cost reduction as objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all the plans of the world banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year's Master Plan Optima, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for an additional fiscal year.
Customers who let the savings banks escape will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardianiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the liability war - which penalises margins - is reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and cash pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity already moves at the credit price to compensate for the margin drop.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't close the tap, but the differentials are higher," he said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincinoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that it ensures that in Spain "we will seek larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he assured.
He claims that the capital needs "increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And it mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fund-raising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the time closing of markets, it has reduced the importance of some banks already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot issue, but rather what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between caisses
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the merger trial of Spanish savings banks started, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been realized, it can't be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Cívica Bank group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of them have been fully realized; it is possible that, instead of 13 or 14, all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," said the leader.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is carried out "at the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the time limits that have been set in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"The passage of 45 caisses with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a unique trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to be in line with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather few happy opinions about the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of serosity and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that the deadline must be met before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and has attributed to people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of "very important" concentration and "go as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well aware of the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has established the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have resulted in a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or removal of 426 euros of aid to unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of airports in Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to her responsibility for highlighting the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not an error in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there, Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which conflicts with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, Mark's recovery, even though it now seems like fiction science, with a very favourable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, strict budgetary controls, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission encouraged deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (suggest tax plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel had hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the publication were against Greece's bailout.
Finally, by the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to enable a country to recover and at the same time obliged private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has rushed the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although slightly sweetened, was approved and, in the following months, we should be attending the Union reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she doesn't think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree, from that date the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which countries that transgress the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be forced to declare themselves a cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear part of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a strict growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The release is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just about recasting the public deficit at 3% in 2013.
What we're asking is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater peace of mind.
And we are aware of the opportunity we have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard him in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, we have opened the way to the the thesis that we must put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And one of the possibilities we are looking at is that we cannot exclude that of abandoning a monetary zone that is too crowded from less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she warned us.
Sport and law fraud
The Russians similar to Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
The tedious expulsion in principle by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the League of Champions made a lot of ink on the anti-sports character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team already won clearly), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, the two players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next match of the dam match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards at the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Discipline Committee sanctioned the coach of the team, José Mourinho, with two matches, and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is based on theethos, unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate in the case reported is due to the fact that this has been the protagonist of a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its hymn shows the nobility and honor and which, on previous occasions, has sentenced its players to a fine for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode more to its dilated history of his histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is expressly not prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether the actions are a fraud of law; because, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sports regulation, but seem to elucidate its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of injury they cause to the sport spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, something that with these actions has not been put at risk, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these goods that we refer to with the correct game is to avoid the criminal player team from taking unfair advantage of the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the actions of Real Madrid players is that they are not comfortable with what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been performed in hiding to try to avoid punishment, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the arbitrator.
They were waiting, and they gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is the kind of advantage that offenders get from the deliberate errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to see that one does not put himself in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and that there is no advantage in the same match either, since of course the result of the action implies leaving one's own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action players perform a penalty match and pass to the second round of cards, in which suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So to scale up, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sports spirit, of which the strategic decision-making is still a part that promotes the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, players did not act to avoid the enforcement of the penalty (it would indeed be a clear case of law fraud), otherwise they chose rather the time when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without exorbiting the penalty or fleeing it.
Although the border between engineering and the fraud of the law is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of engineering.
The polemic, I think, appears because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsiones and because of the way the director transmits them to provoke them.
The evil caused by the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offer offer offer to pick up Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December comes back also the dinner of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which caused the crisis to result in an offensive your adjusted price to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, matching business men and associations in the sector interviewed.
To complete the complex accounting, this year's calendar (like the night of Saint Sylvestre falls Friday) concentrated the applications in the week of 13 December, resulting so far an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 17th and the 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all demand battle prices, confirm the president of Gremi de Restació de Barcelona, Gaitatà Farrás.
The employer's representative is now reluctant to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think long before they reserve."
"They want to get out but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he says.
The case will be "for those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to fall one step with the crisis, so the tranche around the 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various institutions in the centre, the collapse of applications by night 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic demand boom for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the environment, with complete formulae of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the particularity of the calendar has assumed more anticipated reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they say.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate parties in advance.
At their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spending 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as the Catalan wine produced according to the champagne - 'cava' method.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
From the patronate Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Fun in Barcelona), his vice-president, Enric Gomà, confides in the possibility to start seeing the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "animated", even though clients "negotiate at most".
That is true, the hope for festivals has not diminished, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme causes great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy of Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistan nuclear programme causes in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
This is how the Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson listed in a report before the visit of the former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is short and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and a reason for maintaining custody.
"Pakistan has more opportunities to hire staff with strong religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev, from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A statement from the Embassy in May, which defines communication as "frustrating" with Pakistan, supports the following: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to understand "very clearly" to the person responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end with silent support for terrorist groups".
Hunting the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama will be responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow Assange's movements".
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Moreover, it is not new, unless it dates on November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents in the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator lawyer Mark Stephens ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
20 The international police body in Lyon, France, issued the order on request from Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries were given the indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Even if Interpol cannot give the arrest order of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red call a free way for arrest -- that the national police body must realize - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is thought to be located.
The movement induced Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, was willing to respond by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained the permit to leave Sweden of the prosecutor of his case, compared to the famous Lavrentty Pavlovich Beria, head of the security of Stalin.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son -- Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he was not silent.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it has been responsible for giving orders to the U.S. graduates that they urge the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "redicul and absurde".
"I'm not sure why a guy's opinion with a web page should interest us," he said for CNN.
Obama himself has charged a senior anti-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent new leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chairing the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, asked the Department of State to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Even further went to Canadian President Stephen Harper's advisor, Tom Flanagan, who has come back to his statements after saying that Assange should be "murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an airplane without crew or something like that."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist minister, the former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"He who finds himself in the government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and whatever is not an execution would be too kind punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with eye clips to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the internal revolt within ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party's president is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot absolutely give him headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
That is why the Esquerra leader will try to win his new criticisms with eye clips that allow him to stop until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by hand.
If the Carodists want to send a certain penalty vote to the President, they can do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half one more of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod require the president a little more than making his position available to the militia, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve a roadmap with the executive until May.
For this, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the convention for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The leader of the ERC admitted that the "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization, once and for all, capable of washing its family-room linen.
In this line, the article that today's advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideology of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovation thought that the fact that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he points out two.
The first, to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, i.e., to include new figures coming from the acceptance sector of Carod.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that CER liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
For example, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows the holding of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, who has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 convulse conclave directed the leadership to revise the assembly model at a specific convention for the reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend that this issue be addressed.
Now, without the critical sectors at hand, the time could be good for taking it back and closing it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in the Mexico Valley.
During the previous last month of the year 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a dead body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of firearm and the blow thanks to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of a vehicle abandoned on the street Mixtecs in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, from the municipality of Naucalpan.
Very early on Thursday morning, on the fourth, the landowners in common found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the autopiste near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualcoyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he left his house to initiate the garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a gunshot impact at the head each in the colony San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the grace shot in the forehead, a man's body was found on a lonely path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet percussion of 25 caliber firearms.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black waters channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The bodies of emergency have carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body, but they have not been found.
Tepotzotolán residents warned about the discovery of a dead body in Peña Colorada, the hands tied behind and the eyes banded.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot in the neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle on the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the city of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, and two death warning messages were discovered with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony we found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On 17, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the morning following the location of the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, we found the lifeless body of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Aquautla.
On the woman's skin we detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with his image.
By the end of the month, a man's dead body was found on the side of a car in the city of Zinacantopec with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with the redhead and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with the hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside a taxi abandoned behind the San Agustín Colony's Center of Justice.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them had been decapitated in the Couchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next door; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of the country in COP16 stated that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the coal footprint and had detailed that it maintained its offer to reduce between 40 and 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the Sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and to convert its industry.
In fact, he has reported that over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China would not change its goals, but would continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and pilot programme support.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with government and local authorities to achieve energy savings targets, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of filament lamps by savings lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific advisor to the government of this country with regard to climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than we thought.
For example, he explained that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, she has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and is planning to do another similar around 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NAP national leader has detailed that the former bread leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was legal and that the former bakery leader had the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that, in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission d'Ordre de Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if any, by making a claim to the National Council's Commission of Order, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that National Action would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4th and 5th December where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal," he said.
The bread leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we will taste it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council would probably be able to elect the best leader that National Action needs for the next three years, so he would give the "relevance to the person determined by the council."
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He planned that the party's relaunch in the election of 4 July will be reflected in the next debate, even though "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For the time being it is to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that come from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made ourselves "a lot of hopes for them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
When one asked about PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the prisoners to think about the six years of former president Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Grtari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; let them start defending them; let them come out of 'armour," he said.
He said that the federal executive can make expressions like those he did in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no baloon, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter for students without papers
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, you call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitted the American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today in national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, you call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said Obama.
His short message maintains a cyber-link with a wider document that calls on the public to contact senators immediately, as voting in legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of Bush's tax reductions and the government's funding were extended.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs stated that it is confidential that once the tax problem is resolved, an agenda for the rest of the projects can be set.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved by the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The Senate leader of the Democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "vote of debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, even if most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, remained in that country over the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But the partisans require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the competition of a large number of Republicans, at times when the partisan organizations of the protagonist project are an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most distinguished Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they weren't going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the greatest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature you put your finger on the wound
The second stage of Language Pleasures was a walk in which participants took a look at the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the plague? what do you expect of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Language Pleasures, a cycle that celebrates the Spanish literature and this time used the title of his question (on another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the plaie"...we put in the bar," the Argentine writer slowly launched to the public, most of the young, who had met at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "water" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiousologist she is convinced: "forbearance is not my strength, she may be my wound."
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually opened, the symbol is the scar".
The sleepwalking protagonist was relieved and concluded: "On the plague I could only know that it is open and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very related to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a fascinating narrative he called Éloge à l'invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at a given time is discovered.
With touch of magic realism, he spoke of a famous insurgency that touched clouds, returned people who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a story that turns to speak later to America, the great news that had from the beginning of her own chronics and quoted at Bernal Díaz del Castillo that criticized the excesses of the stories of the conquering captains.
"Cervans who invented us all (the writers) made fun of false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that was even missing from the pudder."
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "crazy and liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know which part of the story belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'Cervantes tradition'.
"It's because of his legacy that we're talking about."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with his round table He owes it to the plaice.
Cuba-Portuguese has placed itself on the great scourge of social violence that its country is crossing - and Latin America shares - produces the fights of trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think the good literature, the good poetry the good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after mentioning that the reality of the literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also emphasized "what is due on the wound of the writer engaged".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "the last of every statement there is a small no and behind each negation there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and to nuance means many times to put your finger on the plague and to disturb people who feel very comfortable by thinking of caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting them to regain the sense of writing.
Roman to the hunt of his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that come together, marked by their technicians, who find among them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had highs and lows in his career, but he learned to reach three times the decisive series, even though he has so far not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina finally consoled himself with the underchampion medal, remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Saint Peter's strategy came to its first finish as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with a overall result of 4-2 versus Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Tournoi Bicentenaire 2010, again against the Devils, Rubén again suffered a reversal, because his team had a 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Devils Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to separate himself from the evil in order to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, that's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the hectic when asked him what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last finish, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can hold back is that until the referee whistles the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to draw us were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we cannot celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not concern him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to end in the regular time, but sometimes we just prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately destiny has made a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish of holding the title between our hands, hands he has escaped us, that has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we will no longer arrive in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a subchampion technician and to taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
People need to go to Visa Applicants' Service Centres prior to their interview with the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the visa processing procedure at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to attend the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASCs) prior to their interview with the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will present some benefits for the applicants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, no longer need to make a payment for an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The bidder will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visas will not be required to interview the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest AUC where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the CSA, applicants wishing for a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there for less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants to the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of 26 dollars.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, please visit http://mexico.usembassy.gov/bolets/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency cited the press to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured her that it would present an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which caused speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that we thought were uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems we're talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that we thought was too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from that we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will participate in the geobiology of Pamela Conrad, which explores the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the biggest satellite in Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and Opposing Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th was just settled when the Congress appeared to be an opposing bloc led by PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four asked one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tonned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, did they repeat, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, next to Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Director chaired by the PANiste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms institutionally, one constitutes the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the pattern from political will and if they did not, they would again be served by the two parties and thus the opposing coalition would end.
"Up to this point (the opposite coalition), this is what I look at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartisanism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and now they are talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, and the Convergent has plenty.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that today the Congress has transformed into a 'butin' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, they now divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the Member, to give his place to the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave with cupular agreements outside of 5 which will probably be Members, now to the five whom we see, separated from different fractions, we have decided to join in order to seek a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform that they have done, that they have decided, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mayor of Mazatlán pays another check to the interrogated owner of the electric equipment company.
Another check of about 200 nautical miles in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Mayor.
With this one, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electricity company is 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, the last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "account liquidation suppliers".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State High Authority to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just paid him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques were "reaped" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the latter, on November 16.
Even if the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasury Board has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25, Northwest, had published a review of the cheques issued by the Mairie to its suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos over 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a corner of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Golden Zone Merchants, recalled that they have repeatedly demanded that the image of the destination be cared for and that new activities should replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and sidewalks affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid the close trades.
"Politics only know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune we lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without adequate planning."
Host José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the mayor.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so through preventive maintenance and not only correcting it," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live in it and the Mayors must change their strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it only depends on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not given them the attention they need and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious for all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under the secretary of Tourist Promotion, said that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that need to get in line with the municipality and be a priority for having the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Herourously Mazatlán offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned and put in line to make them attractive to add them to the inventory that we have to promote this destination."
IP Demands Results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members bear the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a dignified and free work legislation between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was set up by seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the Party of the New Alliance, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence and one of PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that new members of the government Congress are clean and committed with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members bear the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
"We hope that members of Parliament will really exercise their right, free from agreements between parties, because the custom is that they will make covenants to secure their own interests and turn into a carnival mask of governors and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to certify their commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the present Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they are doing decent work and especially engaged with society and sectors because Sinaloa people have given them their confidential vote in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces by looking for economic growth in the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they grow economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance of the Government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as important economic activity and generating currency and investment and which directly rivals the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources need to be classified into detonating tourism projects that help to ensure the certainty of the State and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislations have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a king mage.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi Kings will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, for their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaias, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will carry the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live on the day as their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo long aspires to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old younger brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothes of size for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I told him 'we will see, my son', for he was very dear', they remember with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, shoes size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, shoes size 10, while Michael, 8 years old, shoes size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make reality the children's dream of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, giving a toy or money at the reception of Northwest.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
Ten searches were conducted in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen persons have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of haschich, silver and production equipment have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two Sherbrooke men.
The arrested persons were to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could deal with charges of cannabis production, possession for traffic, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were conducted following a long-term investigation, which lasted for almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," said Mr.Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec Regional Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Regie participated in this police operation.
Immigrant migration can continue without problems
The Conservative Bill, which the government is expected to address the problem of ships loaded with illegal migrants, is obviously going to be defeated while the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow anyone from a vessel identified as a carrier of illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for up to one year.
Chief of Bloc Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill, because he took the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, rejected criticism from the back of his hand that his party was not strong enough about illegal immigrants.
"Nio-Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it takes care of refugees and imprisons children for at least one year," Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians are telling MPs massively that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a clown."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections in the face of its rejection.
However, a Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government was going to request a vote for every member who opposes to explain himself in front of his constituents.
The new unit does not act unanimously
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the creation of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil argues that this idea does not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as January.
Metropole has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Police Services of Quebec, on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Nor was it necessary for the Pakistani public security criticism, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as "the rabbit out of a hat" and as "a bricled solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who were concerned that political power had too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it, just say it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"More Mr. Charest refuses not to want to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have an investigation commission is to resign Jean Charest," says Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
He therefore suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he says.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent escort is not the only project in the Charest government cards.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This application would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments to this file.
During the Spring 2001 operation, which hit motorcycle groups, even though the Criminal Code was inadequate, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the law on gangsterism.
High-supervised rivers
Several streams remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road has narrowed down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, ranging from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimetres of additional rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
Sectors north of the river and the Outaouais Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the already accumulated snowfall in some areas, several streams of water are feared.
Warnings of flood warning were issued on Wednesday night by the Civil Security of Quebec for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in St.Jerôme, in the Laurentides, and the Chêne, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the flooding of certain lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away because of the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the flooding of certain lakes led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on an alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annnik Bouchard, security advisor.
The Quebec Crus Prediction Centre has, for its part, issued warnings of strong crus for several rivers on Wednesday, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Wolf.
Partially Blamed Dupt
Quebec's Radio Animator Stéphane Dupont underwent a partial reversal to the Canadian Council of Radiotelevision Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements on social assistance and Haitians as well as on its crude wave language.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their views, but that certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that did not suit the broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who had committed suicide, did not infringe the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Common Front of Social Assisted Persons of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The facilitators must provide solid information rather than misleading.
With regard to suicide, facilitator Stéphane Dupont found that suicide was a gesture of cowardice.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont the noon" have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
So no blame has been taken in his place.
The last dispute involved statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then turned to a media face-to-face that had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI facilitator stated that he had made no gift to help the Haitians because we could not know for sure that people in need would really receive money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've served my three-day suspension before."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," the facilitator said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of coarse language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during long hours of listening within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montrealers of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai boxing climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve with professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights a bit everywhere, since for those who don't like the game on the ground present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one working as a security officer and as a commission for the UPS company has just issued bad news to its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur Championship (WKA) from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the category of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing, he explained."
"I am currently preparing to go to China for the San Shu World Cup."
"The fighters who ended up among the first four in the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the fifth grade tournament, while I arrived in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've progressed to every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punching and foot blows, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
The duels are originally held on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to hold only one event in his career, he will surely respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most noted and most prestigious in China, explained the sympathetic Gaillard."
"It's a bit the equivalent of Limpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, did he analyze."
"There are four fighters by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the half-finals are facing at the end of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face to crown one champion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec has committed $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor companies that has obtained the most important, that of project management, for a sum of $295 million without call for offers.
This consortium, called Energy Management, was formed in 2004 in a manner consistent with the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with responsibility for managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Management Consortium secured the lucrative contract without any public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, the use of consortiums of companies poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"It's the new way of collusion and defeating competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing this in a secret way, now do it openly," said Pakistani MP Sylvain Simard in a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he could hardly see how the public's interest could be served in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was a collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she insisted, claiming that the PQ had been "bad" and had "lost of rigour."
She said that "it would be the least of things" that the PQ would apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scope of the work.
The construction site is in progress and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition game acting; there was negotiation.
Therefore, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As indicated last week Le Devoir, the consortium formula in the engineering counseling sector is being investigated in the government.
A rapid overcrowding of Quebec's business register allows more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dasau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same moral person, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the James Bay responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a special way since the 1970s."
The head of the Eastmain Project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made it easier to recall that the project's management contract was granted on a voluntary basis.
"If you go on calls for offers and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's the people's competence," said Mr.Laporte.
This contract granted to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has increased 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting his participation in Energy management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known in the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped the fact that the PQ is also linked to those companies that "finance it", before stating that it was rather his leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - "green" label inspires no confidence
More green, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair trade marks and green certifications to guide his choices.
Pis, even if he swims in a media universe where messages for more responsible consumption stir, he deplores a lack of credible information, lack that he even qualifies as a brake on his commitment, indicates the Barometer of responsible consumption, the first reading of which was delivered yesterday.
Even though they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, however, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University Consumer Observatory.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that appear to be co-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the politicians' speech on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, responsible consumer information appears to be crucial in stimulating this currently animated consumption of almost one third of Quebec consumers.
The lack of information and the doubtful nature of the information would calm the burning of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also say that they are suspicious about the alleged performance of green products or services that are sought to be placed in their hands.
On another note, consumers were about half in 2010 to have changed their habit and above all to brand one or more products to meet their beliefs.
At 61 per cent, they also promoted purchases from shoppers in their neighbourhood and preferred the purchase of food grown in their region, the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumer index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumer of Quebec likes to appear as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But its social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside its car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transport or recommended co-carpooling to defend their green interests.
The walk and bike were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just taken its first click.
A state loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who was asked to engage financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but with only one loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who hoped for a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, not getting what they claimed.
The government agrees to involve itself in the file, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan of which the amount would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources of state offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have since been reviewed downwards.
A proposal and action plan was sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who piloted the eXcentris file.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the counter-proposition of the firm arrived at SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31st to respond.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the government's gift must really be removed.
It should be recalled that the Association of the Owners of Cinemas and Cinéparcs of Quebec was opposed to a direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the community called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, for ten years held the author's cinema in his premises in the complex after having financed his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films was horrifying in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to trust his clientele.
The Société Angus and the Parallèle, with their head Christian Yaccarini, piloting, on their side, a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the wheel of acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February next by projecting the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remember Le Devoir and we don't know what he and his group think of the downside proposals they are making.
The veil rises on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables divulged by WikiLeaks shed light on what the United States considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians towards the Americans, but at the same time betray their sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out on the public square yesterday, offer more crunchy details than substantial content to put to the teeth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, or in the federal electoral campaign, reports how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gave some explanation for this situation.
"A nearly inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday issues rather than bringing this election to the United States (like in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the Elephant proverbial of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands, at least, this "disquieting silence" which both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"The ability of a candidate, a party and more and more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should logically be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to vote."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009, by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure the government's survival in the early February vote of confidence on the federal budget, by which Canada will display its first deficit in more than a decade due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," said Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast at CBC refer to the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or to the CIA's muscular interrogations.
Another cable reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but based on "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we note that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's waves that the responsible for this massive flight should be "murdered".
Mike Huckabee echoed in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday to Cancún a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases (GES) which corresponds to nearly one third of the additional reduction to be made to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolized from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, by electroluminescent diodes bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), most of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emitted on the planet to enlighten humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the global car park.
In Copenhagen last year, large issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary reduction plans that are expected to move global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, this balance sheet will need to be subtracted again 5 gt to stabilize by 2020 the increase in climate at 2 centigrade to avoid becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produced by light.
With fluocompact bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs average 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new bulbs in DEL, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats as well as emit very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have posted reservations for fluocompact bulbs as they contain mercury and they need to be eliminated as hazardous wastes, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place prescriptions.
But, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather the coal thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity spent in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction costs 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire awaits the announcement of election results in nervousness
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the interim results without further delay," said a spokesperson for the United Nations leader."
"He calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the deadline of Wednesday, midnight without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday election.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CIS had stated on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied on Wednesday in the world to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "frauduous" votes in the north, held by the former revolt of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian President, said that the attempts to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the President leaving to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints were held by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo's opponents feel that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northman who degrades any connection with the former rebels, found the delay in the announcement of the results to be "acceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and complains before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidency, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained split in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the votes compared to 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (IIB) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% in the overseas departments), showing the adjusted data of the provisional seasonal variations (SVC) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million m2.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the population working in metropolis and 9.7% with DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they seek a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has still deteriorated, with a further increase in unemployment, raised to 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
The seniors, for their part, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points over three months and over one year), 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only 25-49 years of age have had unemployment stability in the third quarter, 8.3% in metropolises (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini being examined and detained
Alexandre Guerini, 53, leader of waste-processing companies and brother of the PS President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and defeated at the detention house of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guerini was examined for abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, resil, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and tends to explain to himself all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's something else to prove them," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, had, through his lawyers, to make the judge pass a memo before his hearing.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined Wednesday night and collapsed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but to run the discharges he had to handle.
As for the allocation of the markets or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he never got to know it," said Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Agglomeration of Aubagne, was examined Wednesday for the diversion of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the file.
"My client has been able to provide explanations to the facts that are being blamed."
"The instructor's magistrate took it into account by not depriving him of freedom," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday night in Wednesday, with two of them being placed under judicial supervision, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of the Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is continued for "trafficking of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being examined one for "substract and diversion of public property by one person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "commitment of diversion of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guerini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "receiving abuse of social property".
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guerini figure Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently collapsed in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting the Corsica.
Investigators suspect its companies that they have served to clear money from big banditry.
The investigation is conducted in the framework of several judicial information open against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in procurement, particularly in the waste sector.
As a source of the investigation, the research focuses on, inter alia, the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne as well as some cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the opinion in haleine in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée has explained its strategy to the Americans, even giving them advice on the treatment of their own "hidden" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not been in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by American justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put in a raw light how the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
The Elysée Counsellor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals forced into Iran.
"Believe of the noise," they say, "go on marching" in the media the words "rights of fundamental man", "innocency", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to."
For past the attempts of discussion by discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters in dilatatory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was "a familiar Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that Clotilde Reiss prison release (which will take place on August 16, when she took refuge at the French Embassy) "will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros of bail).
And it reveals that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains locked up in Iran.
Information is being disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. demands extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, upon a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which traces Iranian clandestine networks in the acquisition of nuclear material, Majid Khakavand's enlargement is a bad news.
Did France accept a trade?
The liberation of Iran from the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Alllegrone on September 4, François Richier made sure that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he said, has not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but has sought to oppose it.
"There have been lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the custody of the seals" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision", he observed.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Councillor of the Elysée composed a telephone number, hung, and then informed the US diplomat that Iran "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, the Elysée does not sacrifice its efforts, by means of press releases and "fleets" organized in the media, to suggest that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that manipulation bears its fruit as several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the "blitz" media of French officials".
On what is based so much of "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials in private acknowledge that they only have a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then looks at the reasons why the Elysée had to pay in this fiction.
The intense effort to communicate "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and immeasurable".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows it's a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"She should at least plant confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the release of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans last midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called "Cendrillon" law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under 16 years of age, have reported representatives of the Ministries of Culture and the Family.
"A lot of kids play these games all night and then have trouble studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and the right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the Minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6am in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the enforcement of the law, he specified.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit their daily access time to these games for young people whose parents are asking for it, the manager added.
It will also make available to people who require free software that allows you to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designates the organizing countries
In the wake of suspected corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee calls Thursday the World Cup Organizing Countries 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where the fights of influence and lobbying are likely to take the step on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Fifa queen competition will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities included in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political issues of a World Cup.
The back-stage treatments are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the Fifa assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Tetrii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that only once hosted the World Cup in 1966.
The BBC made a layer of it, Monday, by broadcasting a documentary that paints three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to disgruntle Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the government hopes to re-edit the coup succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained the organization of the JO-2012 in 2005 for London.
Will this intense activity suffice to resort England's blouse with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack assets with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could dwindle their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of its file (stads, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced a "loyal competition in the preparation of the vote", in an allusion barely veiled to the charges of the English press against EC members.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Mr. Putin launched.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appeared to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, seat of Fifa's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long run on Japan and South Korea, which separately built a very good project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the World-2026 to China, which Fifa's ardently wanted, would in fact give rise to Asian odds for 2022.
With Qatar, which came out of the great game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion to new territories, but both countries presented more risks than certain ones.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (due to the time gap) by European countries, the nerve of the war on Fifa.
Second mandate: Evidence
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac have not had the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One warrant to Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence is not good cleaning up with the part of a mystery attached to the presidential function.
So we have to act as if doubt still existed.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even if not believed, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "someone leaves in the fall of 2011".
Let him mention to the UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday night in Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has thus sown a bit of febrileity.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We're a long way from here.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five years to two.
He made a note, not an ad.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the president, on the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"To the worst, or at best, you still have for seven and a half years with me," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about the next step."
His previous remarks did not make him no more candidate than the previous one; they did not make him less.
If they give comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the PS candidacy race, on the one hand.
But this is not the high school entrance to Segolene Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is clear that much of the PS demands a more early battle order than expected.
Bad surveys, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP above," immediately and prudently reacted to the Prime Minister's surround.
"If he believes the defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll always believe he can win," says Alain Juppé, who was re-signed.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchase of State securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the way out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the closure of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that must be completed at the end of the year.
Europe's sovereign debt crisis is forcing, the Frankfurt Emissions Institute will probably not be able to afford to be as peremptory in order to worsen a situation now more than it is in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether it considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond procurement programme.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...)."
The President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, in Brussels, at his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, did not show any more dissident as to his intentions, merely saying that the State securities purchase programme on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting this Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main unchanged master rate at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' indiscretions, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the eurosystem central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the anticipated continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists do not expect significant changes either.
If lending operations to more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB will continue to make unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine she's significantly changing her program."
"If not, it would be to take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", anticipated by Norbert Bräms, a economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations to encourage an atone market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It is necessary for it to replace the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the packaging of the returns paid by the most fragile states," said an important bond manager yesterday.
For if interest rates run out, States will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, or to stabilize it.
The safeguard of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is doing the round back
After a disturbing start of the week for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday, with the drop in compulsory rates to 10 years.
A return to the precarious calm.
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the presidents of the region said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "unbreakable" and wait for a "unforeseen" weekend, which he then denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of the cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown at 263 points, leading to a certain influx in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared himself "strongly concerned" with "the turbulence of the markets" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the alarm of the tax returns that go with, making the state the risk of being unable to cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecast was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate is on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," says Arigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short- and long-term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are less than those requested in other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, a economist-in-chief of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which early elections could be held at the end of March.
It would then open up a period which would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still hammered it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe it was still demonstrated on Sundays and at nights, are obviously solid, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European State bonds has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we can't talk about a start of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which depends in particular on banking systems," Exane BNP Paribas said.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and its dangers, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more generally, with their G20 peers go well.
This is also for the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings of the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro-zone countries in the market filler (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a round of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the extreme-oriented investors of the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it will certainly prepare the field.
The first issues of FESF securities are scheduled next month.
Yesterday, an American official told the Reuters agency that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The first-line countries, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms in addition to the closer effect austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both of them are at every price to avoid asking for international aid before putting in place their own budgetary corrections and to decide on structural reforms that are essential for a lasting return to confidence.
European funders finally look at the options available to accelerate the process of standardisation of sovereign bond markets.
By way of passage to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had first advanced the idea that if the 750 billion euro mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand it over to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an increase of about EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct cash injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with up to now EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions were to worsen.
Neige et verglas: 24 departments en vigante orange
Neigious episodes still create traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange surveillance due to the risk of snow and ice.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, the Two-Sèvres and Vienna joined the 20 departments already in orange surveillance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Neigious episodes are significant enough to create difficulties in traffic and disrupt certain economic activities, prevents Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were banned from heavy weights of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes that recommend taking its vehicle only if necessary and the movement of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was prohibited for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to restrict the movement of heavy loads.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to greater caution on the roads and adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Branch (CGAC) requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% at Orly due to upcoming snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France has been going through, billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital endowment of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is the sum that will then enable the GSP to borrow part of the financing of its dual loop on the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Amending Finance Act 2010, which was considered in the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special capital tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is recorded: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is an adjustment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and assign this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that account for?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from four billion.
"It is stated that these tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation that will be mobilised by the state and brought to the Society of Grand Paris as a measure of the project", it can be read in the statement of reasons.
At the GSP, we can't find this shocking system.
"From the moment we create revenue (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion afterwards, we explain."
"This will be included in the budget and taken as and as it is measured."
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised are still absent subscribers, is likely to cause a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers vendors and spies in due course
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears only as a scandal in the face of hypocrisy which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
But proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (from any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" U.S. revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's sinisterly caricature profile had long been for sketch cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files must be composed only new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the earlier books.
And not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (he does not know where to seek news about the non-existent), but because those who want occultism believe only in what they already know, and who confirms what they have already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Same for secret files.
The informer is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) the chief of secret services (unless he could be, I know, editor at Libération), who retains only what he recognizes as true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department were the same as the newsweek published earlier this week.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Heads of State can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into centres of espionage.
Any viewer of an investigation film knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put U.S. diplomacy under a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the state department.
So the scandal does not put the victims and the "burreaux" in such a crisis.
But let us come to the deep nature of what has happened.
At Orwell's time, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been fully proven since, having been able to control each movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as now happens, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - may know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said it, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this very powerful injury?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to put on line any information reserved - this would be to publish it on a post glued to the street.
But it's just as obvious that with current technologies, it's worth hoping to be able to maintain confidential phone reports.
Nothing easier than discovering whether and when a head of state moved by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that for the moment, my prediction comes from science fiction and is therefore Romanesque, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who discreetly move in due diligence to uncontrollable routes, being only carriers of messages learned by heart or, at the most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in key closed drawers: at the bottom, Watergate's spying attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to write that technology now advances in crabs, i.e. backstages.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized the communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wire (telephone).
The videocassettes (analogues) had allowed cinema researchers to explore a step-by-step film, going forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (numerics) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, and the travels it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is not extraordinary, therefore, that communication policies and techniques return to the horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was in the secret of the embassies.
The embassies are now asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France bids its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review compliance with the fast-deployed funding promises (such as fast-start or early funding) made by developed countries.
And the big French bidouillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU played a major role in convincing its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast-start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large-scale event, brochure distribution...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated for its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with a level of precision.
The EU announces that in 2010 EUR 2.2 billion has been released, which puts it on the right track to meet its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen "new and additional" agreement, in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of the Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France had blocked the procedure.
Today, each one chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has considered as a reference in 2009: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France believes that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to spending in previous years or at the overall level of Public Development Assistance.
In concrete terms, France's total support for developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ lent is equivalent to 1€ given.
Of course, this is hardly justified: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission mitigation based on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that will be recovered as an equivalent to a euro given to it... Moreover, it should not be counted as the cost of lending to the lender country (i.e. an interest rate equivalent).
But France has only made such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass-pass tour!
In summary, in its fast start funding, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of action in time and on the other on the reality of financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, she is able to claim that she spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that Bercy has achieved arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it was enough to lend ?) and in the negotiations as developing countries are not entirely due to...
The chapter on early funding is only a relatively short-term issue, compared with the overall climate discussion.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): there will be no escape from the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be of such a nature to increase the level of international confidence needed to advance in the discussions.
Child-ingested pesticide alert
A 10-year-old child swallows on one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Generations Futures (formerly Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which predicts that its results "have no significant statistical value in terms of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", bought food generally consumed in four meals and a one-day meal by a child of ten years, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as frianddise, were reviewed by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as potential or probable carcinogenic and five substances classified as carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we see in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is worrying," the association noted.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as some carcinogenic as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, which is intended to be included in the study, presents traces of six chemicals, of which a fungicide still prohibited in France.
Same thing for Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the chopped steak, the tin in box, and even the bread baguette and the chewing gum were truffled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is probably under-estimated, according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on the other hand, proposed "to address the emergency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "an increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
