I noticed that she sat in the front row.
I opened the box, it was empty.
I thought he was angry and going away.
I was the one who called the door.
I called earlier.
I saw the man run over by a car.
Wow, I'm sorry.
He fought racial discrimination.
We went without him, because he wasn't ready.
He left on a trip to the United States.
He died three years ago.
We called the door for five minutes, but it was empty.
They had to amputate Tom's arm.
They came up on the subject right away.
He came by my side and pretended he didn't know me.
He lost all the money he had.
He painted the blue door.
He tried to run the orange.
It was great, I went to Kyoto.
It was negligent for her to leave the door without locked when she went out.

It was a great night.
It was a terrible week.
It was a nightmare.
He sat in front of me so he could hear.
He came home three hours later.
He comes here every five days.
I see the moon on the horizon.
You come here every day?
Come any time you want.
You come here every day?
We'll wear wool in winter.
Keep an eye on the cars on the street.
Come with us.
Come any time you want.
Come any time.
Virtue and vice.

I'd like a clearer tone.
We want complete prayers.
I wanted to buy the book, but I realized I didn't carry more than 200 yen.
You want to marry me?
You want to do this now?
You want to play tennis with us?
You want another cup of tea?
You want a beer?
He wants a watch like yours.
He wants a watch like yours.
You're taller than her.
You need it.
You don't have to eat it.
I want to go to America someday.
I want to learn Esperanto.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I want to stay here.
I want a book, is it the bookstore?
I want to see the ocean.
I want to live in a quiet town with clean air.
