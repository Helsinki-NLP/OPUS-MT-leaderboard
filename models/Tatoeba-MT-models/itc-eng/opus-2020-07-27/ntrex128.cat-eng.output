Members of the Galles Assembly are concerned to "identify them as Muppets"
A number of members of the House expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament), a member of the Welsh Parliament.
This controversy stemmed from the plan to change the name of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a cause for ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "remained with Twp or Pwp."
For non - Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru Party assembly commented that his party's set "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
On the other hand, a Welsh Conservative member claimed that his group was "open" before the name change, but he also commented that there is a too small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is spoken in a similar way to the letter "u" in English in Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly responsible for drafting the legal deletion to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint the members of the assembly will of course fall within the members themselves."
The Wales Government Act 2017 gives the Wales Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, even though the committee was decanted by "Gallish Parliament Members" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was given greater support to the public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives; however, the attempt to reach consensus could lead to a complete misunderstanding for the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the operation of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their name during the legislative debate.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on their country's name change
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for the Northern Macedonia Republic.
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that has lasted for decades with the neighboring country of Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to be part of the EU and NATO.
President Macedoni, Gjorge Ivanov, contrary to the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's cease to sound: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the older people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is none left, both of them."
According to Adam, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he says.
"The bars have already stopped being those kind of living rooms for the neighborhood where people went periodically."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as his leaders predict, "and sooner or later return to the place where they came from."
The churches, they add, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will not be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he says, "so what they will do will be speed up the closure of all churches, since it is quite unlikely that most people who move to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white - language congregation there departed in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to retail merchants on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they took over the wagon.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to his St. Martin's church, described the rousing as "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who sounded the rostrum in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the first carriage in the world that was touched by a black-breed musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest cart in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has sounded in St. Martin's over the past few months, on the other hand, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them led by the church's lay leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July all expressing its concern that the diocese "will transmit costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in contracting the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy looking for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he was spending about half an hour knocking with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help, and then rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was about the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!'
He had all the shriveled clavicle," Hammel observed when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone comes out of the water, I cried out, 'There's a shark in the water!'," adds Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to grave status.
You don't know what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that work a few weeks had been detected a shark in the area, but it was decided that that species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic wounds in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities shut down access to the beaches for 48 hours from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's to Ecinitas for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's, to the beauty market of the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenhams with parades of beauty products in the style of large warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These large corridors are only part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the United Kingdom, a market that moves about GBP 28 billion and continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors stay behind, and will be tested at 11 stores all over the country to expand to more shops next year if the test becomes successful.
Investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of space on their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's claims that it will double its beauty offer to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also take up more space with areas of brand-like brands that can be found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also in the relaunch phase of its range of boutique makeup products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an increasingly demand for young consumers.
The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two stores in Sainsbury's, the first one did so last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and switching into a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made large supermarkets need to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, Executive Director of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly resemble large stores in an attempt at the supermarket chain to fight Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's been introducing Argos sales points to many of his supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to resell sales of junk and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The earlier attempt of the supermarket chain to release its departments of beauty products and pharmacy turned out to be a failure.
Sainsbury did a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended hastily by not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the drug chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of his 281 pharmacy business in Celesio, owner of LloydsPharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury skin brands, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, says, "We've transformed the look of our beauty products corridors to improve the environment towards our customers.
We've invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help in offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and the practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and we challenge the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones "dangerous" after Holly Willoughby gets behind a GBP 11 million deal
The Dragon Star's Den Peter Jones went "dangerous" after television host Holly Willoughby turned behind a £11 million deal with Jones's lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to engage in the joint home product business and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Pttrow.
This Morning’s 37 - year - old introducer used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragon Star Den Peter Jones angry by withdrawing in the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle business to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "sudden" when the red star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his empire center in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, which the new agreements of the presenter, worth GBP 1.5 million, implied that he would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of home products and Truly accessories.
The business had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptrew and aspired to double the fortune of Willoughby, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When 37 - year - old Willoughby used Instagram to announce his move from Truly, Jones took a private plane heading for one of his vacation homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to a source: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
He was destined to be his long - term future, where we would see him for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to step back left without words all the parts involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of goods at its central Marlow ready to be sold."
According to experts, the march of this Morning's presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from cushions and candles to clothes and clothes for home, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined him as president last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of the share in the Baldwin television producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm A Celebrity ITV program presenter.
A source near Jones commented last night that "We will not comment on their business."
Bad accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticisms he received from the media to make a comment that some would consider to be "little of a president" and to have such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why'd you give up Trump so much?
Trump said, mocking a news presenter's tone of voice:
"I have not given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearisation are stagnated.
More than three months after the summit held in June in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong commented this on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "response in correspondence" by the United States in the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
However, he observed, the United States continues to apply sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump’s viewpoint, however, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
And now we're maintaining this big relationship."
According to Trump, their efforts to improve relationships with Kim have had positive results: end of missile tests, help to free hostages and return home to remnants of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this county full of people, we'd have about 200," said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was told to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population in Lombok had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," says Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute to the provision of help.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although Aceh has built shelters in the case of a tsunami, they are not frequent on other shores.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the case of a tsunami, although there was a warning in force, it is very likely that he contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of Indonesian islands is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to accommodate the victims of the earthquake is now heading toward Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of the poor infrastructure of Indonesia, and he has invested enormous amounts of money in rail and rail roads.
However, Joko's government faces the next year's re-election loaded with funding deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of permanent sectarian tensions in the country, where Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displacements are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs with bricks, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool is the goal of the empath with a far-off shot in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with his goal scored at the minute 89 Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea gate when his team was losing 1 to 0.
He accommodated the ball to the left before letting out an incredible shot directed at the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great elevation as it was propelled to the right-hand cross of the porter.
The ball finally began the descent over a full jump Kepa Arrizabalaga to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," says Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kanté was coming, I made a knock and didn't think much, I just got engaged in fighting."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at the break after marking a 25-minute goal through her Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the front of the Blue team went back a step back to Mateo Kovacicic before he pulled from almost the middle of the camp and sped out into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
Then, he made a magnificent passage in depth, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball controlled.
Hazard surpassed the defense to finish the second pole with a match with the left leg where he could not reach the porter of the Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples at the Champions League group phase next Wednesday at 15:00 in St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for its part, will play with Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths due to the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the buildings collapsed due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place Friday and that caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu — more than 380,000 inhabitants — was covered by the ruins of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after finding a woman stabbed
The murder investigation started after the woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with several stab wounds on Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the locals to see or hear something about the crime before the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statements: "Although the investigation is still at a preliminary stage, I would like to make a call to everyone near John Street in Birkenhead and that I had seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially to taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the car's on-board camera, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman they found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are reporting facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When she heard what had happened, she ran out of words.
He's warning the residents that hours will pass until they can get back in.
You could hear a police officer telling a man that the whole area is treated as the crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
Don't stop repeating "It's awful!".
By 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the area, in which another truck was parked outside.
A number of Roman agents inside the agreed area controlling the block of floors.
Anyone who can have information to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestopers through 0800 555 111 and mention 247 on September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in the British parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewrite history"
Its disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban's purest style of many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "boxy" and a "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of Westminster palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordained nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing Cromwell incorrectly for the actions of his ancestor that he did during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy to be commemorated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as a parliamentary defender in the face of external pressure, in his obvious case of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a completely accurate representation is a topic of historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th century Middle Ages conflict constituted the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A murdering pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified solely by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered with blood near a pork court at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject cattle into pigs in a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as it is known, he had traveled Wednesday with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him a herd of contiguous pigs.
He said in court there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kild garr had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs crushed and full of blood," said the cousin, named "Wu," as he mentions the news of Guiyang's evening.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig was shut down and isolated to prevent anyone from attacking anyone else, while the police were gathering evidence at the crime scene.
The Yuan family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation for their death.
Although very rare, cases of pigs that attack humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her farm in Massachusetts, and left the man with severe wounds.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kg grabbed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife could startle the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC news that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "decompanting."
"They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt.
Just give them the respect they deserve," he remarked.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains all over the southwest of the United States
According to predictions, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and southwest of the United States over the next few days.
Rosa had winds 138 km/h, owned by a hurricane in category 1, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, U.S. East Time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning to develop in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving toward the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to leave a tropical rainstorm heading north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate torrential rains widespread throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
They are expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is the possibility of laughter, as the situation is getting very rapidly worse because of the scattered character of tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged from entering the desert on foot in the face of the tropical rain threat.
Storms could cause the gorges to become uncontrolled rivers, and storms could bring wind and dust clouds to specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains at certain points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible that there are total precipitations above 50 mm, which could cause minor waste streams and slippery paths.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
They'll start arriving isolated tropical rainheads in Arizona between Sunday and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread to the corner region on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
October there will be several major fluctuations of temperature for all of the United States as the Arctic cools down, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature within a short distance.
The Central U.S. region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic differences in temperature.
There were close to 20-degree temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the lingering heat of summer will try to expand again.
It is expected to start in October with heat in much of the Central and Eastern U.S., with temperatures about 27 degrees from the South Plane area to parts of the North-East.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures above average in the U.S. during the first half of October.
Over 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million viewers saw the passionate witness of the candidate to a member of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the usual Friday program due to a round of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of charges.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee for judicial matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to get her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, asserted that he was absolutely convinced that this was never the case.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers are likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company had average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC viewers.
Audience figures were not immediately available for other chains that broadcast the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Besides, Nielsen usually has problems with calculating the people he sees from his office.
In perspective, this is an audience similar to that of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders who clearly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the chain with more audience, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the one-day testimony, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second to 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's data.
Interest stays high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that they would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while being rebuked by protesters when he was trying to get up to an elevator to go to a hearing of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake spent several minutes with her head-on as she was on live TV on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
"You think he's telling the country the truth?
They said, 'You have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!"
Flake said that his office had issued a communiqué and, before the elevator doors were closed, he commented that he would have more to say in the eyes of the committee.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcasting chains were already broadcasting live when the Committee of Judicial Affairs had to vote whether or not it was following the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate plenary to vote on it.
Flake said, however, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the next week's nominee, a condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations she had with her friend, Democrat Senator Chris Cons.
After a later conversation with the Conons and several senators, Flake made her decision.
Flake's choice had an influence, since it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in connection with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and demeaning national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the conservative party convention in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, May Boris Johnson's former Foreign Affairs Minister reinforced his attack on the so-called Brexit Chequers Plan, which states that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect taxes on each other is "absolutely absurd."
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU team player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year basketball player who enlisted on the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and sent to prison for second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and claimed that Simpson's DNA was found in them, according to CBS WAFB's subsidiary.
After interrogating Simpson, he admitted to having Wayde killed a shot, according to the police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The coroner's office in East Baton Rouge district released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gun wound to the head towards the neck.
The department thanks the State of Louisiana police operating group, the state police criminalist lab, the Southern University police, and the local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that culminated in this detention.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva expressed his appreciation to the local order forces for their "dilience and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
He was about 1.98 feet away, and he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebots to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "broken down" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow."
"Things like this are the ones that make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
A volcano spits ash in Mexico City
The spitted ash through the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighbourhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within a 24-hour period.

Geophysicals have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the Independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favour of independence faced the riot police and thousands of people joined in opposing demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on their secession.
A group of independent individuals held by the riot police started throwing their eggs and dust painting, causing the appearance of dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, police raids took place, using their pores to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters calling "Long Life in Spain."
Fourteen people were subjected to mild injuries during the protests, according to local sources.
The tensions did not diminish in this region of independent mentality one year after October 1 a referendum considered illegal for Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists was held.
The voters chose independence for a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, since the opponents of secession boycotted majority voting.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote by entering the electoral colleges throughout the region, which caused violent clashes.
The independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place equally, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narciss Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independent demonstration together with his wife, said that he no longer had a lot of hope about the possibilities that Catalonia would offer independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best times.
I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although by little margin, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independent parties suffered to keep the empire this year, since many of their leading leaders are in self-imposed or detained exile, awaiting trial for their role in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the demonstration of police support by his phone, and said that the conflict had been fueled by the politicians on both sides.
"The tension is only increasing," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Present as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the backwardness in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after covering a house with a car
Three 33, 34, and 39-year-old men have been arrested after a car repeatedly invests in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says they caused damage to the doors and the building itself.
It's also possible that at some point someone shot a bullet against the car.
A Menga game gives Livingston the victory for 1 to 0 in front of Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with Livingston was to win
Livingston, who had climbed the category this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which it is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's game made the difference, since, with this victory, Gary Holt's team comes to second position, which is shared with Hibernian.
Gerrard's people, on the other hand, still don't win out of the Premiership this season, and next Sunday they'll face the leader, the Hearts, who separates them a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid in Europe League this Thursday.
The Livingston, meanwhile, expands up to six games its speeding crack in the line, with a Holt as a coach who doesn't yet know what defeat is since Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston doesn't take advantage of his opportunities in front of the visitor's direct game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scorer long before the goal, since its direct game caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defense, but he wasted his opportunity when he found himself in front of the doorpost, and then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out to lie down trying to finish Craig Halkett's head pass, who crossed the door.
The locals were good enough to let the Rangers get close to their area, as they knew they could put visitors in trouble in isolated play.
And that's how this decisive goal came about.
The referee whistled a misappropriate against the interests of the Rangers and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could touch it first and end from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated possession, but he met with an impenetrable defense and a Liam Kelly porter who had very little work along the game,
The scene repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a fine stop.
For his part, Rangers' porter Allan McGregor stopped with his feet on an occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up diverting another combination game from Livingston.
The Rangers went on to hang up again and again in the Livingston area, just to be rejected, and they claimed two criminals, one for a supposed Hallett entrance to replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for hands, both of them were despised.
Livingston "phenomenal": Analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks that they were excellent, and they keep on exceeding all expectations in this ascending journey.
Their style of play and staff have almost not changed from their return to the highest category, although much of the credit has to be attributed to Holt for the way the team galvanized from its arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be hanging from Menga throughout the party.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments displayed with Gerrard as a coach, they definitely failed to maintain the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly overcome the local defense), and that the Rangers, which is on the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Aggression received for Erdogan in Cologne
It was all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These have deteriorated because of such issues as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's EU input.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police alleged security grounds to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from congregating in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan, many of them Kurds, were also heard while condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and called dictator for others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies when he hits a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedic services took care of the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a runaway case on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of the accident on Saturday.
The metropolitan police said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest family members.
The street has been cut down and deviations have been applied for bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Wounded in A Luggage · Global Voices
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security penitentiary facility, according to the headquarters.
The events occurred in Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire, about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still remains.
Specialized "returned" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight inmates were involved.
Officers had to be held for slight wounds in the face of facts.
According to a prison service spokesperson: "We have deployed prison personnel specially trained to try to solve an incident in Long Martin prison, which still remains.
Six employees have had to be treated with wounds.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, we're clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to report to the police and they may have to spend more time in jail."
In Long Lartin's penitentiary, there are over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
The month of June, it was known that the head of the prison had to be served in a hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October of last year, anti-avalot agents acted in prison to solve a serious altercation in which central personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major rivers (dry areas could be benefited)
It is not common for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen early in the week to come when what remains of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of laughter.
The national weather service has already issued flood alerts for Mondays and Tuesdays west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's expected that Rosa will arrive directly at Phoenix on Tuesday and that it will be near Monday night with rains.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a tweet that only "two tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression in a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models in the national hurricane centre provide 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where they would record up to 150 mm in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas in the south-west desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Conca, could record from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are at risk of laughter, the Rosa rain could become very good news, since the region suffers from a severe drought.
Despite the serious cause of concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently experiencing drought.
According to the US drought control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reportsweather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will hit land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa continued to have a hurricane force on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes it lose strength.
So, it's expected to touch ground in Mexico with tropical storm force the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Precipitation in various parts of Mexico could be severe, with considerable risk of flooding.
According toweather.com, "they wait for 75 to 150 mm of rain from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona at the first hour of Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and arrive south of Utah well into Tuesday night.
"The main risk that we expect of Rosa or what remains of him is very heavy precipitation in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the Southwestern desert of the United States," according to the national hurricane center.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous rivers and streams of waste in the deserts, in addition to landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy has been found with a knife in Somerset.
The teenager was found with wounds in the Midsome Norton High Terrace area, about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he's "stabil."
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have made a call so that anyone who can have some sort of recording of the facts with the mobile phone gets in touch.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "suffered the petty and angry party"
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rejection of the ruthless and outraged tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump decreed in an electoral act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "stricken the petty and angry" of the Democratic Party during his entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh declared before Congress Thursday, firmly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's sexual abuse of her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in relation to his ally.
The president said on Saturday that day, "the American people saw the genius, the human quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable journey of service to the city," he commented to the multitude of supporters of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of the rate of participation of Republican voters in the elections in the middle of the term.
"We're five weeks from some of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn't run, but actually I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obstructing".
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place as late as Friday, according to CNN an assistant of the leaders of the Republican party.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, because of a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival held on the beach in Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast by nightfall, dragging many people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and they didn't run right away, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spoke of the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, smashed everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting on the coast.
There are people who climbed up from a tree fleeing the tsunami and survived, he says.
About 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where the quantity of shops and destroyed buildings, turning and collapse bridges and a mosque surrounded by water is appreciated.
The replicas continued to rock this coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the intense earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographic characteristics of the city, at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
According to Nugroho, the deaths and damage could increase on the coast to about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donalga, nearer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and therefore no information came from Donalga," says Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross commented in a statement, adding that their workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which could unfortunately end much worse," he says.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the officers said the waves came during the time of the warning.
In a recording of a amateur shared on social media, you can feel like a man located on the top floor of a building gives desperate warnings to street people about the approaching tsunami.
In the matter of minutes, a water wall bursts out by the sea, taking buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not authenticate the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused widespread cuts in electricity that have interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, evacuaters continue to need food desperately, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although workers from World Vision in Dongala were able to get safe and secure in the city of Palu, where employees sheltered in shelters installed in the yard of their office, they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba says.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although the relief groups did the desolate task of initiating relief work, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fund-raising, provision and staffing of foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the site where disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While he stayed the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, friends and relatives of the disappeared people maintained the hope that the miracle and their loved ones would take place.
Saturday, a child was rescued caught in a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rune for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagei, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
"As a minor in the way of the paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that, within hours of the fact that he circulated the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel between the parapentist community, he had desperately sent messages by WhatsApp to the Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think this means that the messages were not received,” he added.
Thieves take $26,750 during the filling of an automatic cashier to Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling up an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport police department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy told the communiqué that the vehicle driver was clearing the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man " neared running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects running away from the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes its name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper is changed to Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
He's been in West, age 41, motegen with his nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before it appears in the program Saturday Night Live, in which it is expected to present its new album, entitled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled his participation for "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for it.
"I think it's the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with Big Boy radio presenter.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I've passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more a reflection than we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers that have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love names.
JAY-Z, West's former collaborator, has valued his nickname with or without a dash and in capital.
The President of Mexico, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when there is little time for the country to complete the 50th anniversary of a cruel reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "the military force would no longer be used to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the deaths of 300 people at a time when student movements from left-wing students were taking root all over Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He has stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds allocated to AI
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money they spend on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and a professional specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures in I.A., despite the fact that there is a general lack of formal strategy in I.A. in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in the world with regard to innovation in AI in 2030.
"Dupplicating the budget for research in AI would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next advance in the AI field," said Lee.
"Dupplicating funding could double the opportunities that the US will achieve its next major AI discovery," Lee told CNBC in an interview conducted this week.
Lee, author of the book entitled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an IA system that beat the American player of Othello with the best ranking and later served as an executive in Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively appreciated previous technological competitions of the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defense Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries.
"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain public scholarships," Lee said.
According to Lee, "it's not China that takes academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university prominence to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the work of the U.S. in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think they should automatically offer permanent residence cards to doctors at AI," he added.
In July 2017, the China Council of State presented its latest generation artificial intelligence development plan.
"The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other public bodies in the United States give money to researchers in North America, but the quality of academic work is lower than in China," said Lee.
Early in the year, the U.S. Department of Defence created a Joint Art Intelligence Centre, designed to involve industry collaborators and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month, DARPA announced a US$2,000 million investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Foundation of Natural Sciences, currently spends more than 100 million USD per year on research at AI.
In the meantime, for months now, no measures have been applied in relation to the American legislation that he intended to set up a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians celebrate a referendum to decide whether they change the name of the country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has doubted whether at least 50 per cent of the required participation will be reached for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper is: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name-changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the realm of the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have stated that it will undermine the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularities at 13 o'clock.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," declared 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the change of name of the country, which would open the way for accession to the Union of Europe and NATO to Strumi, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick with our heads high, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of EuroAsian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev claims that incorporation into NATO will be accompanied by investments more than needed in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the great majority will vote in favour of it, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev stated that a "yes" would mean "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum necessary participation.
According to the results of another survey, directed by the Macedonian Telma TV station, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% stated that they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first time for pro-Western government policy since it took over the month of May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, makes a goal after regathering all the defense of Brighton
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory went by 2 to 0 in the party fought at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal a minute 65 in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The silverhead received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He drove off at a speed between three Brighton defenses, scraping off his way through the playing field.
Later, Agüero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He scrambled a defense before he passed a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass on his left that found Sterling.
The English leader returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, who with the right leg beat Brighton's porter, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that crashed inside the network on the right side.
“Agüro has trouble walking,” Pep Guardiola, coach of the City, told the journalists.
‘We decided that he would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate to have scored a goal at that time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the First League fight.
His goal came to the minute 29.
In that game, Agüero received the ball in depth in Brighton's field and
made a beautiful pass in space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before he passed it to Sterling on the long pole.
The Sky Blues front finished the ball inside the network before leaving for the background line.
The City faced Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 6:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Joker, without options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the play-off struggle, there was not a lot of reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to get out on Sunday's launch mountain that comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold an advantage game about Los Angeles Dodgers in the West League, have a chance to play the play-off.
The Rockies secured themselves with victory for 5 to 2 against the Nationals Friday night, but they're still trying to get their first division title.
"Even if we don't play anything, at least we can go out knowing the environment here in Denver, and knowing that the other team is probably going to fight every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this party?"
The Nationals still have to announce an open shuttle for Sunday, but apparently they are determined to let Scherzer throw if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a warm session Thursday and would launch on Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
The right-wing shuttle in Washington has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strokes in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump does a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of the participation of Republicans in the elections of half a term.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, big ones. I don't introduce myself, but actually I do introduce myself, so I'm everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible group of Democrats happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, they see their pettyness, their ill-intended intent.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is "resisting and obstructing".
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he rebuffed, and called the Democrats "enraged, petty, dirty and false."
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking democratic senator of the Senate's Judicial Committee, causing a strong public shout.
“ Do you remember their answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no. Wait a minute... this was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has stopped being a different party.
He's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a number of British parliamentarians to whom we've been told we're not welcome, all to say what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because he showed up firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure I was criticized for discreting with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, they are, ironically, similar issues to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the wake of Friday's Nottingham Labour Party meeting, it was reported that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and it has long been forgotten the promise of 'generous and kinder' policies, if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party's direction.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as you colleagues who previously thought he was sharing a political vision seemed to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take positions that I would never have taken, either on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I'm saying, social media is filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made because my candidacy is not renewed, central policies are denounced, and I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the messages I get are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues that every day have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they don't stop.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of "untrustless" or every change in the rules of selection, the party is further stressed.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice and I have been advised to keep my head down, not so express and "all would be fine."
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by Thatcher's negligent government, which left my whole class literally down, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local advisor or as a minister of the government.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt in any way about my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is walking to a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But, actually, the message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are laborist members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or no political interest will prevent me from acting, according to my opinion, for the benefit of the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Some Ayr rounded lead the lead
Two last-minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs deserved victory in this vibrant game of the day of Tennent's Premiership.
The Ayrs, who are the only team of the ten, occupy the first position at the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to its defensive superiority and the fact that it was better able to take advantage of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The games we've played so far have tested us and we're still stuck, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose said: "Congratulations for the Ayr, have taken advantage of better occasions than we have."
Grant Anderson's test at minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, put ahead of the Ayrs, but a yellow card for the Scottish international Rory Hughes, which was handed over by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted essay.
Climo expanded the advantage of the Ayrs with a sanction and, just halfway through it, he scored and turned a test to put the 17-5 mark in favour of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melroses started the second part and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted to Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Later, the party was interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which retired in bed, and the Ayr dam extended the distance again with a Stafford McDowall trial converted to Climo.
Then, the alternate Captain Blair Macpherson was warned of a yellow card and again the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a plaque in Climo without a pilot, from the sanction line, MacPherson scored a counter-testing behind the penetrating Ayr mole.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the retreading, after Kyle Rowe picked up a fight from David Armstrong and put the ball on the third line at Gregor Henry's to score the fifth rehearsal of the local team.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game series, seems to be ready to move to the hospitality sector after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis' character in BBC's popular series, who writes and co-protagonizes with Greg Hemphil, his comic partner for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although a source from The Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "florent restoration sector".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without coastline, hopes the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
The sailors patrol for their ship covered with base in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a flag of marine blue.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazons are enthralled with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It is a duty to recover it.”
Around Bolivia's landless territory, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a conflict of cruel resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as it is the longing to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulses, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, let's not say, she waits for the result with a positive stance," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivarian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at TIJ's resolution on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will rule in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign departure to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for the upcoming re-election year, also has many hopes deposited in the resolution on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts feel that it is unlikely that the Court would decide in favour of Bolivia and that, in case it does, things would not change much.
The United Nations organization based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territories and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The TIJ resolution, which takes place only six months after the final allegations were presented, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a relapse in the past four years.
"The current Bolivian Administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
"The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has attracted any gesture of goodwill from Chile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia to The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally rapid.
Bolivia next Monday will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of discrepancy, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can be trusted in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho claims his nation won't eliminate nuclear weapons if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when it seems that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stagnated nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's hot to think that US sanctions and opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War can never get North Korea to kneel.
Washington refuses to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make any major disarmament movements earlier.
Both Kim and the president. American Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang taking seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers to be the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo has planned to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last range of big hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which illuminated the style defined in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the Instagram has been torn down by very unpractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's outstanding piece was an exaggerated bee hat, adorned with a broad wing, pen-shaped, which flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized fittings, there were decorated sandwiches, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of living colors, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high seams.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like an ice cream cone.
And if you follow the big trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Style Observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The big-sized hats climb the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat, with a double-legged wing, which everyone has carried, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult tag behind the hat so impractical that it spread through social networks led another great creation to the gateway: a bag of straw for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed with bathrobe that wore it.
The rabies bag, with dark orange, adorned with rabies locks and finished with a white leather strap, was the highlight piece of the collection The SS19 River in Jacquemus on the Week of the Fashion of Paris.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags in the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a pity that the demand for large accessories was ignored.
John Edward: Linguistic competences are essential for world citizens
Independent Schools in Scotland maintain an academic excellence trajectory that continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are striving to provide a top-level service to students and parents.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, for their chosen career, and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a very popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak a man in a language that understands, you’ll get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the year's exams, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages received the A - Superior Note.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, reflected that 72% of students received a superior A qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% French students and 63% Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital competences that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as an assemblage of choice, are maintained in the same consideration as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) assignments in study plans from independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that of the reasons why employers gave them the costs of covering the vacancies, 17 per cent was attributed to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
Because there are more and more opportunities for potential work that require languages, these competitions are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like that.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and the French, with 15% speaking, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
That's why investing in language teaching is important to today's children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children the best opportunity to find a major job.
In Scotland there is a diversity of schools as to the languages they teach.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest, he'll always be able to choose between a number of languages in the independent schools, who have teaching staff specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future may look like.
In the global trading environment of today's era, it cannot be denied that languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communicative competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent School Council
LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is practically over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-temporal game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we still have to determine the minutes he'll be playing.
"They'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the Lakers' official place.
Mike Trudell, a Laker journalist, tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After this week's early training, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six pre-temporary Lakers' games.
“I don’t need pre-time games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he replied.
Trump's Mitigation in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump's scheduled matches for the next week, which include visits to friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation for your candidate to cover the Supreme Court's vacancy is pending, Trump seeks support for the next half- warrant elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 a.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via live video transmission on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing initiated this week with the candidate nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of the allegations of sexual abuse that he faced, while the Senate's anticipated confirmation vote is pending for a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this wave of meetings is to help Republicans present themselves in the delicate November elections to gain momentum.
So, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for the next week are directed to "estimating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the Representatives Chamber, according to Reuters.
“Congrès control is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while we are heading for a season of campaign trip trip”, said a Trump speaker who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, programmed at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could congregate supporters "of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract coverage of Pittsburgh's media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him impetus in the polls," commented Simon Haeder, a polytologist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The American team shows their ambition to keep the hopes of individual Sunday parties alive
After three unequal sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamic is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on which side is the positive dynamic now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're on a little positive run," Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has one advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is blowing a little in its favor and have a lot of reason to be animated, largely by the state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and is setting an example.
The celebratory critiques rose in intensity as he continued his turn and put a crucial putt to match the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game in hole 15 with a similar shout, of the kind that indicates that he believes that the American team is not yet out of competition.
"You have to work hard and worry about your own party," Spieth pointed out.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes for printing.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable sensation of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple bring four of them and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way in which their energy seems to flow to and from public bullying, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun is placed on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at once in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs in the morning, who paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes plunged the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never had a chance to go out.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and ants are very fascinating to see for the interactions between devices, the advice they give and those they don't give, and the way a strategy can suddenly change.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe reaches the end of Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a victory of 10 to 6 over the United States.
The inspired two formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a difficult Tiger Woods and leave his record, so far, four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, mastered by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to preserve the trophy that he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a somewhat uncertain American team at the fourballs in the morning and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but they couldn't reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points at 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to get four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple who earns four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After slamming Woods and Patrick Reed in the furballs, they called a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself into two games on Saturday, showed sparks of sporadic genius, but lost 19 out of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the fourballs in the morning, re-matched Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell for 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have everything on a pleasant and windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times tournament champions, and Justin Thomas set up a reference point for Americans on Saturday to achieve two points.
They won a victory with determination for 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quaballs and later won Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4 to 3 in the forsome, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the story of Ryder Cup a team had solved a four-point difference to individual parties, although Furyk's team, a title defender, only needs to tie up to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack coming on Sunday is out of range.
North Korea declares that it will not be unilaterally disarmed "in any way" if no sign of confidence is seen
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying their mistrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong told the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important good-will measures" in the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing centre and committing themselves not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't observe any response in consonance with the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not start disarmament unilaterally in any way.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-phase denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps gradually, its statements seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral full denuclearization, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump made at the first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim committed to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the war in Korea in 1950-53, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang has to eliminate its nuclear weapons before.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearisation must first occur and increase the pressure level with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "war declaration of an end," Ri pointed out.
“The perception that the sanctions will make us kneel is a chime of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that continuous sanctions are intensifying our mistrust."
Ri did not refer to the plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this stagnation situation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from that of last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump titled Kim from "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
Last year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage to take disarmament measures, but stated that much remains to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Last Wednesday, Trump said that there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia maintain that the United Nations Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm the complete and definitive denuclearisation".
The Security Council has unanimously launched sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in a bet to finance Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then reported that he would again visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeio has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that they had made progress, but in a few hours North Korea accused him of "demanding himself from a gangster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States took “measures in consonance”.
He said Kim had told him that the "consonance measures" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight the growing culture of studying all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar observed that students at the world’s 1st university are often disillusioned with the basics of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after making a talk about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, "Why do they tell me now, all this, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," reported The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told basic concepts about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, said that the University decided to enter the course after learning that some students had a serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, of an hour of duration, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, babes and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects sleeplessness, and about the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to stay awake all night still exists, he said, and he added that modern technology and growing pressure that students suffer makes sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
To make sure to enjoy a sound of good quality for a long time should be a "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid winning weights, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in in an infantry mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the last year in his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to carry out a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light that emit electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulate team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's house that's another crash outside.
Ibox's set sought to add his first home win from the February triumph from 4 to 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team drift, at 8 points from Hearts, unstoppable leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half, and it never seemed that the Rangers, uninspired, were about to match the marker.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, the Livingston rises to the third position, behind the Siberian by difference of goals.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, since the judge of the Calum Spence line needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object that apparently was launched from the liking.
Gerard made eight changes regarding the alignment that the Ayr swept into the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same 11 headline that picked up a point against Hearts last week, and he was probably satisfied by the way his team, well organized, suffocated their rivals at all times.
Although the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have marked the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scotland Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder fought astray and wasted the great occasion.
A weak launch of Keaghan Jacobs came across Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only made a shot at the back pole.
The Rangers took over, but they seemed to have more hope than they would have in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a criminal on the 15-minute signal, since he and Steven Lawless met, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two shots to the first part, but the first porter of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the docile front Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi may have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only for their efforts.
Again, the Rangers were not able to deal with Jacobs ’ hard work.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard acted at the pause when he changed Coulibaly by Ryan Kent. The change had an impact almost immediately, as the extreme took over at Morelos, even though the imponent Kelly ran into the lockdown.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the visitor's attention by playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett doing long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band might have yielded the direction to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a fight diverted from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton still demanded a last criminal fight with Jacobs, but Thomson once again made his eyes big.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally gave rise to the device we know as "Geiger accountant."
Count Geiger, who is a pillar of science since then, also became a pile of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, some seemingly failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What day is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms emanating from radioactivity to minerals."
Evans: "You sure it's bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and remove malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize is malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting a patient's immune cells and altering them in the lab
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer that was suffering for over 18 months disappeared.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and subsequently injecting them again.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, at Bethesda's National Cancer Institute, Maryland (USA): "The results we've obtained suggest we have a promising vaccine."
Her2 protein "protein favors the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" those cells like treating cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got engaged in a pro-Trump diare with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL program.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was written in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance that congratulated the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said he would be in the 2020 election.
After his third night song, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, he began to criticize Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
"I always talk to white people, they say, how can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program started with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate Judicial Committee for sexual assault complaints filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though he didn't issue, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's disappropriation recording on social media.
It's unclear whether Rock meant to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West complained to the public that he was not well treated in the backrest because of the hat he wore.
"I was threatened with behind bars.
They told me not to wear that hat.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on: "Do you want to see the lower position?" while I said Superman's coat would be put on so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked public shouts at least twice, and the members of the program team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who told the publication: "The entire study was completely changed."
West was taken as the last hour substitute for Ariana Grande, the former one, the Mac Miller rapper had died a few days ago.
West left much of the public perplexed by the interpretation of the song and Love it, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West got support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for breaking into the MULTITUD."
But the talk show presenter, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "existing who he is and that he's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I think adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and now it was "the being formerly known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His colleague raper, Snoop Dogg, used to be called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music changed his name to a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after the seizure of a man on Friday's East Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before Belfast's first instance court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
The Star of Thrones Game, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for representing the role of Spartish Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy-game of thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of virile hero, claiming that these papers make it clear that young boys often think they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times magazine, Kit said that he believed that "something had gone wrong" and that he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the throne game co-protagonist Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that she has strong determination to face this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we've been wrong about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we now experience?"
According to Kit, television can take part in the responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity due to its virile characters.
He added, "What is born and what is acquired?
What does it teach on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have to have this virility face?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because no doubt something has been wrong with the young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, all saying he is full of battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will play a repositioning of Sam Shepard's True West work, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting her partner Rose is the best game she's ever given her.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character representing Kit, Jon Snow, in an Emmy's winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple entered their marriage on the family farm in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase in new cases by 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health care officers.
Only the second quarter of 2018 reported 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to China's health agents' statements at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination of the LGBT collective is common.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to lack of proper precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from senators of the Republican Party and dismounted "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters reported on Saturday allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican Senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the requests prompted them to criticism and websites of extreme right.
" Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters stated in a Twitter statement.
The published information reportedly contained the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on-line Thursday and was published by someone unknown in the Capitoli during a Senate commission session on sexual abuse complaints against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and revealing the information of a member of Waters staff, reported the Capitoli.
"This groundless denunciation is completely false and a pure lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which they have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this information filtering.
This groundless denunciation is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," wrote Fleischer.
"That makes him think he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he won't get angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the accuser's motives.
It must remain calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to overthrow Waters in the mid-legislative elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Importing if true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces to these fraudulent statements.
"We'll make sure the criminals wake up," he continued, "and they'll be legally held responsible for all the actions they've carried out and that they've harmed each and every one of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again: limited spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It's tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this reposition of Johnny English's comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-sater about how we are despicable will be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the incompetent eyes and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time its license to twist everything, its name indicates more than anything else that is a comical creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with tradition of going to cinema.
Obviously, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamorium, has a bit of Clouseau, a point by Mr. Bean and a touch by this guy that brings a single note to the topic of Fire Cars at the inaugural ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Originally, it was based on Atkinson's international and mysterious traveler who represented Barclaycard's now forgotten television ads, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There's one or two good moments on this last JE trip.
I loved Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the blades of the propeller were retreading him in the helmet.
You see the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems quite flowing and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission It's impossible to now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems for children rather than adults and, for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as clever or focused as the dumb gags of Mr. Bean's character representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An IT pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the disquieting of the service agent, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and harassed figure, who already suffers from a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character pressed by Teresa-May, but the script doesn't get any more.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as every active spy is in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And this includes the poor Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but teaching out-of-office classes about how to become an undercover agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with its Bough-sequate sufferer, paper again representing Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, when things get very ugly at Her Majesty's secret service, come into action once more and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the technological billionaire charismatic who claims he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madges: dressings of waiters, burning a French fast-food restaurant, creating chaos by smuggling on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
All stops have certainly been removed from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, all together looks like a children's program.
Pretty normal things.
As with Johnny English's other films, it was not helpful to think if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that would bring justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and covering five of them.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to spend the savings made with the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers by giving them another day's party.
Employees would enjoy a weekend of three days, but they would get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The one-week shift works four days with the support of union confederation Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits the Party's perspective of balancing the economy for the worker and in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, "A four-day workweek is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
The shadow minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also imply that shareholders in water companies might not recover the entire investment, since the Labour government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees in business meetings and to create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to mix annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his appointment for the Supreme Court at least one week, and has raised the question as to whether the Agency's findings could influence a republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, correspondent for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that changed their opinion.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean it," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had.
He stood firm, determined and secure."
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I'd present an explosive charge," he said.
"Dra. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it," I added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I name will be able to verify.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see anything change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive star program, which carries out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition of this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help actively combat it.
To receive a free entry for the event (unless someone wants to pay a VIP entry), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to awaken consciousness about the goal of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizen now achieved in 12 years to achieve its goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one case more than we call "clicivism" (a guy who thinks it makes the difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than 37,000 million dollars, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2.250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, of which at least $10,000 million has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that currently protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the foundation of The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and realizers with them in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "help children grow as well as possible" and promises to send to Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a bit of a page of history," said Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on their website that asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied, "It's going to be a long, hard way, sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will triumph, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will be performing at the youth event in New York, who will present Deborra-Lee Furnesss and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blocking" to block Russian energy exports.
Washington can, "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including Middle East, have revealed U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he supposedly said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent their energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the event attendees by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "energy consumer's vision" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are actually equal.
"Economic choice in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of using and replacing fuels," he said, indicating that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements arrive while Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in place of Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to get out of the North Stream 2 "inadequate" gas pipeline project, which Trump says turned Berlin into Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which cost $11,000 million and will double the existing gas pipeline capacity at 110,000 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, declared Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow on September.
The US position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, the FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to withdraw EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said she would "think carefully" her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think carefully" her candidacy for the presidency after the election of the middle legislature.
At a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government fracture, for women to hold high positions," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take my candidacy as president seriously."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction."
"I am frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his High Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed that it should not be presented by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said the senator should not be presented, according to the survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed a wider support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator for Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes TEPT Track Palin's hit at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after listing September 11, 2007
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"With what's happening my own son since he came back, I can understand other families who suffer from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds with which our soldiers return," he told the public at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the next of his son and other war veterans: "they turn a little different, they get stiff, they come back wondering if there's respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other members of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged for domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and armed youth under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge to a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
18-State representatives and the district presented a friend curiae in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs Sessions case demand that the American Union for Civil Freedoms presented in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent band member" assaulted her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of domestic gangs and violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Karl Racine, declared Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require asylum applications to be awarded according to the facts and particular circumstances of demand, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to curiae amicus.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy denying the entry of immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, as it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "proportion of necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims who escape domestic violence and gangs.
"Alas is available for those who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or a concrete political opinion," Sessions told their 11 June announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never intended to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a spirit to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is getting more and more desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her child with fever in a evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There's no drinking water."
Residents have seen themselves return to their destroyed homes to take in flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who have broken their shoulders, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are treated outside because of the heavy shaking they repeat.
Tears denied her eyes as she explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where she was with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassing itself with "propaganda announcements."
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in a American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China's payment supplement on Wednesday to The Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of joining the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November, China denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with U.S. elections marked what American officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify the pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to insert advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and has seen to push the spiders into mutual imports.
China's vindictive spiders at the beginning of the trade war aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and companies in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion paper at The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It's redoubled harassment with the publication of propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and free press to include a payment announcement in The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the kiosk that is down here in Beijing, you will find few discrepant voices and will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens may have on China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women's voters before the Kavanaugh disaster elections, warn analysts
As many of the leading Republicans support and defend the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing various sexual assault applications, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the forthcoming mid-legislative elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," explained Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last hour pressure to conduct an FBI investigation is sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants called for "November and coming!" as they manifested themselves in the Senate lobby as Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Ms. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will remain out of the picture," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've already been tall; that's true.
But they could have been more, especially among women voters of suburban women and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote until they like the president."
Even before Ford's public witness, where he detailed his sexual assault claims to the High Court candidate, analysts suggested that there could be a negative response if Republicans pressed with confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, a representative of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the vote of the board or the final vote, nor if Kavanaugh sits at the accused's bank, it's also about how Republicans have managed this issue and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of USA Priorities, a group that helps pick Democrats, on the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Star of Ford and the witnesses of Kavanaugh, with the balance that leans slightly towards the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in ford's testimony in an unprobably or probable way, while 35 percent claim to believe in otherwise or possibly Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh had probably lied or proved during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's applications and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez complained that the candidate for the Supreme Court taught him genitals at a party while they were studying Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the web inventor is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where they store their data and what people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intention of Inrupt was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," said the emerging company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-dos lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a browser at the same time.
What is excluded from the personal data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company integrates appropriate resources, processes and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers hired to work in the project and a community of voluntary encoders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralised applications through the tools available on the website of Inrut.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Saturday publication at the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrut, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Church of the Cross Victory of the I GM
The only clergyman in the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial tombstone in a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was present exactly 100 years after his grandfather's guarded prowess.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under intense fire from cannons and machine guns."
Later he ran to the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage" he pushed the row before throwing himself on a cannon with one hand and leaving three members astonished of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a prowess that could never match, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a real hero is shown by support that he will receive from many people.
MMA's fans who lay awake all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine you stay awake all night to see Bellator 206 and you refuse to see the most important event.
San José's poster contained 13 fights, including six of the main cards and they had to be live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, the United Kingdom viewers were astonished when the programming changed in Peppa Pig.
Some felt disgust when they looked up at the night and saw the struggle.
A Twitter tracker described the change of cartoons as "a kind of vomitous joke."
"The government's legislation says that at 6:00 this content is inadequate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Marketing and Communications of Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pick the piggy, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they'd work on programming to include United Kingdom viewers in the future.
"I think when I think of repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there are six a.m. on Sunday mornings and we can't solve it until Sundays at our hour, Mondays at theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed the channel, there were a lot of messages going and coming, and they weren't all nice.
We were trying to figure it out, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six the way we normally do, we tried to show it again by the followers, but it's over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims he has grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the Desert Island Radio Radio 4 program, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to "hope" others.
He also said that being a father was still important to him for winning the Olympics.
The usual feature presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months of sick leave.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck on Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" the others because "it wasn't socially acceptable as children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me power and strength to triumph."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high-profile LGBT movement promoter and has used his image in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world trip said he had fallen in love with a man, the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "took me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 bigger than him, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you pass so when you are young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone as old as he has experienced.
The couple were parents in the June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, according to Daley, "all their perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had come in for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "father, you won't be there to fill the first row," he said.
"While holding his hand, he stopped breathing and it was not until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in the Olympics. There was no better feeling," he declared.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small's Proud), which he had listened to in preparation for the Olympics and which he still put on his chicken skin.
Desert Island Disks is broadcast to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worse Miccelson presented himself to Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Miccelson will make a record on Sunday in playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to become an unhappy fita.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments divides his time between acting as an entertainer and working on his game in the field, hoping to correct what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult journey of Le Golf National, where the long rough usually punishes the detours.
And if his own trajectory is not discouraging enough, Miccelson, on the ninth game on Sunday, will face the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the Tommy Fleetwood Rookie to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, they start strong, the Miccelson party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He understood his role perfectly for that day, he slapped me in the back and wrapped me in his arm as he told me he would be ready the next day," Furyk said.
"You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
It's a Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained, and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a race to Ryder Cup that didn't match its individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought untouchables to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, joking, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great teammate," he said.
"I think younger players also had fun getting into him this week, which has been fun seeing.
It adds a lot more to his game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that starting with considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team headed by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but eventually won the win for the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep reminding us that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," Bjorn said, in the image, after seeing the 2018 team victory for 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, leaving the score in 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the team members that is not over yet.
Tomorrow you have to go to every machine.
You have to go out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the dots get up on the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I said, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also remember who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Enchanted with the performance of his players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with that.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to deliver to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, rival Captain Jim Furyk expects his players to surrender better individually than on team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the payouts of the last day, as he was part of the winning team on Brookline before he ended up losing in the Medinah Miracle that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the Captain of 1999, was motivated by his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start on a good foot, as seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We've prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to initiate the rally against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I've chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," says Bjorn about his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Army should have ended in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it would not at least do so until the next year, with defective systems and an increase in the cost, according to local media.
The end of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigates, has postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that Armada commissioned in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-bucos missiles, as well as technology against theft, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods of maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuous delays mean that the advance ships, which were expected to project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they are in operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was already reported last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to Drassian Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Army returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons why it was returned, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unusable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, since about 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Army to add further improvements to it.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz will weigh as much as double as similar ships used by Germans during World War II.
Besides defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached a surprising EUR 3.100 million (US$ 3.600 million) from an initial budget of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, taking into account recent warnings that indicate that the maritime military power of Germany is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Army "is running out of ships that can be used."
The officer claimed that the situation has worsened over time because they stopped using old ships, but none was provided again as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Army.
National Foundation Examines the Secret Life of Ratpenates
A new research carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to find out how the landscape is used by the batpenates to feed.
It is expected that discoveries will be able to provide new data on the behavior of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to be soprano and common, as well as northern earring and water in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track bats' activities during the station.
Volunteers and staff from the United Kingdom National Health Service will also perform mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The sound analysis of expert recordings will determine the sound rate of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a habitat map will be created to create a detailed picture of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor to the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are more important to batpenates and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat management jobs, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Construction and restoration of buildings threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, just like the chemical-killing paper used in construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a catch.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to place insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the bats very seriously.
He has ten trained experts who conduct surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescues in a regular way.
Even the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to bats on the Three Estate farm, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of ratpenate in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and still a good habitat.
But we still know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow."
It notes the importance of checking whether there are bats before doing property maintenance tasks, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 young women, which could lead to the disappearance of a whole local population.
Ratpenates are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scottish Ratpenate Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about ratpenates and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population."
Ronaldo denies the rape charges as his lawyers prepare a suit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the charges of rape against him are "false news" and has claimed that people "want to be famous" by his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
Portugal's head and Juventus has been accused of violating an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Allegedly, he paid $375,000 at the time because the incident wasn't made public, according to the information published by Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a 33-year-old video of Instagram Live addressed to his 142 million followers after the accusations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo said they were "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five-time winner of the Gold Pilot in the camera.
"They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything's in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the suit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which have qualified as "inadmissible information on private life suspects," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After he met at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the reports filed in the county court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy," except for "1%."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual relations, but they were consented.
Mayorga also said he went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later he accepted an agreement outside the courts because he had "for reprisals" and he was concerned "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the deal, as she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to fix for the King Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he was placed by Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "always regret it," if it lost the state of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary for Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "disquieting" that the Toyota base in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in case of an unagreed Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Getting out of the EU without any agreement on how trade with other EU countries will work has aroused the fears of other U.K. car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims he'll close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider to be risks in the production chain in the case of Brexit with no agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on a "just time" basis, with fish coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from the United Kingdom and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without any agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances on the border, which the sector believes could generate delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and it should stop production as a consequence.
Clark states that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "accurately balanced to avoid these border controls".
We want to get the best deal we can, as I say, not only enjoy today's success, but also take this opportunity," the BBC Radio 4 told today.
"Toyota's testing, as well as other manufacturers, indicates that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota couldn't confirm how long the production would stop, but in the long run, it warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the United Union on the plant, said that members begin to be very concerned about the situation: "For experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "possessing a week" while continuing the fight on appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements of the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and help in Trump and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fired or not the Deputy Attorney General and put Mueller's independence at risk, he's been fueling the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times already reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of filing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but he postponed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate judicial committee that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the FBI about the charges against Kavanaugh, which he delayed the entire Senate's vote further.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered the following: "It hasn't even been set a date yet, it could be this week, although it may be to delay another week for all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists may object: Sanders has not had any briefing of the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like television reporters' fanfare, even though he said, "I won't deny they're fans."
He then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any sources: "We have consulted these data."
Sanders said that the information sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the possibility to directly ask the president of the United States, it's far better than talking to me.
We're often trying to do this, you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the briefing sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press rounds with dignitaries on official visits.
Individual press wheels are uncommon.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal appearance and, at times, strangely in front of the assembled journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service due to fears for Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the EU's UK exit.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of state residency applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and everything seems to be geared towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in case of a possible unagreed scenario.
I know it's time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate now that I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, bring a valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service, while benefiting the patients and the communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency operation after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee State Tigers re-re-initiation has undergone an emergency operation after a head injury on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ, from Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before half.
"He came in the band line and collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing it on a stretcher and taking him to test it out.
An officer from Tennessee State informed Chris Harris of WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left surgery at the Vanderbilt medical center.
Harris added that "there's still no information about the type or extent of injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after it came from Illinois.
I had completed five plaques on Saturday before I left the game, which totaled 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax on buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax on buying property in the United Kingdom with additional money used to help homeless people according to new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded on those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The list expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
It is expected that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax on buying property in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's move to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect the highest yields.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taxed on those people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be used for government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
The inventory expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new construction properties are of non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has asked for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the big constructs of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the contributions on affordable homes to correct Britain's " real estate disaster."
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as control over the rental and completion of "no blame".
He also wants to give more power to the joints to build new homes.
May said the following: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is just as easy for people who don't live in the United Kingdom, as well as for businesses with theirs abroad, to buy housing compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home is too distant and the indignity of people without home makes it even more real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland's coach, Jack Ross, said his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotch has accepted the challenge of reviving the north-east club, which currently occupies the third position in the League One, three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to Scotland Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned once as a support, and that's all," Ross said on BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father when I was little and it's always something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I'm successful in training clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors in the position of Sunderland coach include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Ex-Athletic says he's not under pressure to be next on a list of names consecrated on such a large team after he's previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich Town's offers.
"For now, my criterion to measure my success will be if I can get this team back to the First League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it's obvious that its place is the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd just think I'd be successful here if I could get the club back."
Ross only has three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical body.
He helped Alloa avoid falling to third grade and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross claims he feels more comfortable now that during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"Probably it was a decisive moment," he recalled about taking the charge at the Alloa.
"I always thought training was what was best given to me, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, I got out rationally and enjoyed quite good times.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot you need to overcome every week.
I'm still going through things like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've heard since I'm a grown-up."

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 a.m. Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave fired consumption at Britain's hard-pressed bars, but added more pressure to the chains of restaurants.
Bars and bar chains have increased by 2.7% in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of CGA's financial counseling, the company that collected the data, says: "England's continuous hours of sunshine and participation in the World, which was longer than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to that of June, with the increase of 2.8% in the bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption at June restaurants has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by drinking, have got the best results, while eating at restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered with the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the restaurant case.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
At the bars and taverns we have consulted, the sales of drinks have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, of the Ocium Analysts and RSM Hotelery, said: "These results continue the trend we see since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events continue to be the main factors related to sales of the foreign market.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% per annum would be especially harmful, rather than continuing pressure for costs.
This long, warm summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-serving trades and time will say if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide this much-needed breath."
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, has been 2.7% in July, as it indicates the slowness in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales indicator for restaurants, bars and taverns in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to a survey
A poll of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "false Insta" pages
News has raised fears about publishing sexual content
20% of students say they have a "primary" account that shows parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, believe social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in "insta fake" accounts, an Instagram reference, the photo-sharing site.
News has raised fears about publishing sexual content.
About 20% of students say they have a net "primary" account that shows parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager urging others to "violate me."
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Private School Steering Committee (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, of which half has admitted to have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the athletes' voices in the Scottish athletic federation's directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed a non-executive director of the Scottish athletic federation directive at the annual general meeting of the organization.
Doyle is a field and track athlete with more medals from Scotland, and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide sport to benefit from his dilated international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh has the respect of the community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm looking forward to acting as an athlete's voice, and I hope I can grow the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympics and is currently a BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote the following on Twitter: "I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I can recover or to what degree.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's agility practice!
Thank you for the cheering messages!"
An ad of bullfights comparing mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
An Internet opinion firm has been divided into an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to mixing cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered to be the "first silent screenplay that can be taken from the world," the Elvie consumer technology company has issued an announcement inspired by a playful music video to show the freedom that the new screenplay gives to the mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ironing and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I'm pampering myself, but you won't see any tails," and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not bragueres, but my breasts."
The return goes on: "Bomb, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, lug the girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom say it shows the "horrors" of the lactic industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to milk, to the difference they are separated from their babies a few days after birth," wrote one person.
Elvie tirallet is hidden discreetly in a lactation supporter (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But why don't you use them to advertise a mother's teller that they'll keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an out-of-place announcement."
Other people defended the advertisement; one woman admitted that finding the song was "funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the drawer made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as what it is.
It's a great product," wrote one user.
Another person commented the following: "It's a fun announcement for mothers who bomb with tuxedos (usually at their place of work or in the bathroom and feel like cows.
It's not an ad to praise or judge the secular industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the drawer quietly placed on the supporters.
The concept of hiding behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when using the tidallet.
However, Elvie's tidallet is completely silent, has no cable or pipe and it fits discreetly into a lactation bra, which gives women more freedom to move, subject the babies and even exit while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother's first childhood nurse and developer, said: "Elvie's tirallet is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
By tracing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a tidallet is used and the challenges it is to do so, while we demonstrated, in an entertaining and didactic manner, the incredible sense of freedom that the new tillellet offers.
It's not the first time Elvie is on the news.
During London fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the bridge for designer Marta Jakubowski as she used the product.
Hundreds of emigrants, quietly transferred to a tents camp at the Texas border
The number of detained emigrants has increased despite the fact that monthly entries across the border have remained practically stable, partly because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be appraised.
Traditionally, most godfathers were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid of risking their chance to stay in the country if they decided to host a child.
The risk has increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the possible fathers and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs control officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
" Nearly 80 percent of the people who have taken in or live in a home of a person who has taken in are illegal in the country, and a large majority of them are criminal aliens.
So we're going to continue chasing these people," Albence said.
To process children more quickly, officers have introduced new rules that require some to be brought to trial within a month after being held, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, instead of presence, to defend their case to obtain legal status in front of an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help, will be deported immediately.
The longer the children spend in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or attempts to escape, according to the workers and reports he has given to the system in recent months.
Advocates claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where they are more likely to ignore the signs of a child’s suffering because of their size.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that they already suffer a lot.
Syria urges the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Mualem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war of terror almost is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displacements.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a country hit by war.
On the refugee issue, Mualem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed "some Western countries" for "irrational reasons" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition takes place to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last great rebel bastion, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russia's assistance in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has a "clear terminis" and has expressed the hope that military action will face the jihadists, who include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, sent from the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee formed by government members and opposition to begin to profile a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would again win the elections in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, the scandals and the process of dismissal ended with his presidency prematurely.
What would, of course, be "the end of a more dramatic presidency of history."
For now, there are no signs of fatigue in viewers.
Since 2014, the number of full-time viewers has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million full-time viewers, from the 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" of theMSNBC, has led cable television audiences to 3.5 million over the main informative nights.
"People have seen themselves lying there because they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, the executive producer of the ABC series "Designed Survival", about a cabinet decree that happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told him I'd vote Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"I answered that because it made him laugh," said Scovell.
There's an entertainment point in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if the immigrant families can get together and the state of the world economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go further when you are at the sixth hour to see a group of experts discussing the use that Bob Woodward has made of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather jacket ("a piece of thick clothes like his pride", headlined Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, let's say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes it seem to be part of a TV program is that every night gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" on the character changes and screenplays of Trump's program (to fight with NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to lose any episodes because you stay behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and I was alone outside the house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked looking at theMSNBC while I was recording the CNN.
He couldn't disengage himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we did those crazy programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but it seems they were right."

External money floods the races of the most adjusted House of Representatives elections
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of the congressional districts that have made two current members compete for the same place.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburg involves Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who got the place in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were drawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed in January that the old districts were divided unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the major financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for the Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was named after a victory in Pennsylvania, followed by a special election held in March to represent the 18th Congressal District of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but they withdraw them.
Diplomatics observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian president Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners threw out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of US diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for the "new decisions on quitting Taiwan," declared Heather Nauert, spokesman of the department this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador was contemplated, which in 2017 received US grants of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cutbacks in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths due to murder and arrest.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But in the middle of September, senior government officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, which effectively ended with any probability of sanctions for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for the middle of October, as a sign of the importance of the administration, according to diplomats.
The three American envoys discreetly returned to their positions of office in Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesperson from the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations since the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also since the anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study History
The next event could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump to justice, of which there are numerous evidences in public records.
As you know, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in his election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump might find himself accountable to the body, just as he prepares to do it in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
They are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both Atlantic shores that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, the German officials were prepared to take a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted it and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over such inflection points and speeds up or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing several inflection points today.
What if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been with water on his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not suitable for the office.
Rosenstein claims that the Times information is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court even with the credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, in particular, are we going to vote in mid-legislatively for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable for it?
If we don't get through these tests, democracy will start to run into danger.
But I think we won't fail, because I've already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light candles of Saturday at that table with the swastika.
With this bag, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic towards the Vienna Rapid Party
The Rangers received the Vienna Rapid Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive four in the Vila-Real camp this month, would leave him in a good position to be ranked in the G group of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season up to fourth 2-2 against the Royal Village, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trap for great results.
"It was a good point for us, because Vila-Real is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the party believing that we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else out in the end, but in general, the fourth was probably a fair result.
They were better at the first part, but we were better at the second part.
About Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they got a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we'll give it all and we'll get a good result with the support of the hobby.
Last year it was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it all, leave the season behind and be successful."
Women lose sleep for fear of savings for retirement
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking about it with the family.
Approximately half of respondents at the national level claim that they have talked to their partner about the long-term cost of attention.
Only 10 percent of the respondents say they talked about it with the children.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they don't dare think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance company.
We have to start here.
Talk to your spouse and children about how you can prepare your family to make sure that your wishes are not communicated in advance.
He works with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, since these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how you pay those expenses.
Your long-term care funding options may include a long-term long-term care insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover expenses or own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money needed to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the passage into legal battles.
Find a representative to be able to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical attention and make sure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary takeover for your finances.
It is appropriate to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.

Man shot several times with a compressed air shotgun at Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots of a compressed air shotgun as he returned home after going out at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when they shot him in the chest, the abdomen, and the hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which took place about 2.30 in the morning (on British summer time), as a random act.
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is not in danger of injuries, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a heavy earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. "The number of deaths is expected to increase.
Since the communications are cut off, the relief units have not been able to obtain information from the Dongalga region, an area north of Palu nearest to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important data on Palu and Dongala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, on the edge of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dogalama is a region that extends over 300 km of coast north-west of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in western Dongala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific fire belt and there are often earthquakes.
The following are the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the western coast of the province of Ace, northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half that in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands died on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude shook a pop zone in the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude struck one of the islands of Mentawai, on the coast of Sumatra. It caused a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regime in Aceh, causing both destruction and panic, as the population remembered the devastating effect of the earthquake and the 2004 deadly tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami. More than 100 people died from falling buildings.
2018: A series of great earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, natural of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a well-known man tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he pulled out his phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su Provisional Detention Centre, where he is held with a non-guarantee obligation of 500 USD, according to KTUU.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, surely" when he was asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin is facing three class A shortcomings, which means he could go to prison for a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a class B shortcoming, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time criminal charges are registered against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness related to the incident.
Her partner said she had punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for associating his child's violent behavior with a posttraumatic stress disorder derived from his service to Iraq.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead · Global Voices
At least 384 people died after an earthquake rocked the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media broadcasts videos with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a home depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a West Side Highway bike route at Lower Manhattan and run over travelers and cyclists during his journey, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intendedly" and that "intendedly" caused serious personal injuries, according to the warning of intent to seek the death penalty presented in the South New York district.
Both crimes could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-file indictment that included eight accusations of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required "significant planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the South New York district brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted by conspiracy to carry out spying actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents Saipov, native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He has declared himself not guilty of the 22 misdemeanor.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders who represented Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty, instead of accepting a sentence of guilt and a life imprisonment without the possibility of freedom will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Member of Parliament of the Conservative Party states that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative party conference.
UKIP's previous leader said politicians should "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of the members of Theresa May's parliament themselves suggested that it should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would be outside the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in reconciling her deep-divided ranks was highlighted when the conservatives in favour of the union presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Czech commitment plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, Union supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist that they will reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure the Eurosceptics and the Conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told Leave Means Leave of Solihull's rally that he wanted to undo Chequers' engagement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed as a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out now,' she said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added, "I will defend Brexit, but we have to undo Chequers' engagement."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to stay there is totally false."
Conservative partisan Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of the reporters, "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, to listen to people."
"Checkers' commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the street and get us to win some election.
Abandon Checkers' commitment and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added, "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that the politicians at the rally must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"That, now, is a question of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't allow them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Union’s supporters marched for Birmingham before holding a two - hour rally in the center of the city.
A small number of activists shook flags on the conservatives against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they experienced with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus agreement, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of being a candidate for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll examine the possibility of running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a usual critic of President Donald Trump, is presented for his re-election in November against the state representative of GOP Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He was the center of speculation about the possibility of raising Trump by 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the format of open meeting since Trump took over.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to run as a presidential candidate.
Warren replied that it is high time that "women go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for killing Sims, from LSU
Baton Rouge Police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect for death has been arrested from the LSU Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the 20-year arrest of Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 E.T. Press Conference.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday and requested collaboration to identify the man of the meter.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head that finally killed him," police officer Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday in the media for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got a shot at Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken to custody of the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 beginnings during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 bounces per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the title of the world after the team's orders would give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas stood before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost ran out of Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into boxes before and let Hamilton run with traffic to the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop in boxing and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after some wheeled action that caused Ferrari's pilot to leave the inside free at the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen began in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first round he went to the seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then went on to have a good share of the career, keeping his wheels up to save time, moving on to Kimi Raikkonen, and moving on to fourth position.
He finally got into the boxes at round number 44, but he couldn't raise the pace at the next eight times and Raikkonen was placed in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and it was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a great job of having one-two," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday rally to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's witness before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate proved that people are "sick, cruel and lying."
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's going on in the Senate last days, when you see anger, when you see angry, evil, cruel and lying people," he said.
"When you look at the communiqués and the filtrations and say "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?" "Hey, what?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered-- no, we didn't filter it," she added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and filtered in September, but Feinstein denied the filtration from his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's statements, I did not filter his story," explained Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept him confidential, just as he asked me to."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using statements for their own purpose.
"They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, no matter who they hurt, who they have to trap for power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat of Friday in Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back 5 to 3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two-point advantage thanks to the completions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard matched Dundee, and then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had just won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth season match between the two teams and the Giants that won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan repositioned the home team in the game at minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at minute 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the Giants' advantage in the first break when he got the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped, and again Bouchard contributed to its level with a strong goal in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the first advantage during the game at the end of the second part and secured the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next match Friday.
A driver dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake plane
A air controller from Indonesia has become a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake hit the island of Celebes Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There's a lot of replicas going on in the area and there's a lot of people trapped between the ruins in the city of Palu.
But even though his companions escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grande refused to leave his place in the trembling control tower of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his seat to make sure that Batik 6321 flight, which was on the track at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he came out of the air traffic control tower when he thought it was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We set up a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This has broken our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the runes and there are still many that have not been reached," said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six feet [6 m], devastated Palu, who will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying help and crashes.
Kusuma Risa, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the decommitments have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against the clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" communicated to CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the accident in the pond
The airline operating a flight that's going to crash into a Pacific pond in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although previously said the 47 passengers and the crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and the crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities reported Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane docked in the pond because the runway was short.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the lead.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the belt to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and began to scream, and he suffered a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who had worked close to it to improve a dock also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in recorded aircraft accidents in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst made up a story of the night that burned a woman alive
The prosecution concluded the case on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The analyst at the Paul Rowlett Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness to the intelligence analysis field.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to build the prosecution's 29-year-old movement, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another incoherence was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicated that only one week had been known.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The defense plans to initiate its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held by the jury during the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills his music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of gender.
The High Breed of Bristol ensures that hip-hop has turned away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and reshape the conscious hip-hop.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom by the hands of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY maid asks a couple to say goodbye after a "racist" message
A New York nanny has denounced a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother where she protested because she was "another black person."
The couple deny they're racist and compare the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay to see that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOA ANOTHER NEGRA PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs Maurice twice.
After she realized her pifia, a "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse she had fired, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her working day and was later sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims to the couple a compensation for the dismissal and asks for a compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month residency work for which they had hired her, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," he told the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to statements that they were racists claiming Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something I didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in someone's hands with whom you've been rude, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand to an "extortion," claimed that his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like this?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is still unsolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new card
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after she accepted the book, said in connection with the letter: "It's hard to put herself in somebody's place than ling her for the first time before her publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book on a small red bear, was optimistic about the rejection of the book. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agredolç", after his death last year.
Describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and shows that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous man," he said.
"But since Paddington was as real to him, it was practically as when your son gets something: you're proud, even if it's not yours.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
On landing, they took their daughter quickly to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nada often called to say that it was very serious and that they did not expect it to pass," remarked Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he told me he would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so, pretty.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs she had been given to keep her body beating up and they were getting out of her system.
He had died before what was planned, and so everything went off.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I could not scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by relatives and more people.
I had to keep my shapes right."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience she was going through.
"No one knew it," he said.
"I had my head down and my tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for the overwhelming Nad.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I wanted her very much."
Women of mourning hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have killed themselves are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers to which citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want any father or mother to hear what I have to hear every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, with Lydney's residence, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile could illuminate any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm continually concerned that there's a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know that there are people to whom you can turn, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her companion for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said he was not well or that he was depressed or anything like it," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He touched the bottom of Christmas, when the children opened his gifts and he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
He said that his death assumed a great trauma to them, but they had to work it out: "Open a hole in the family.
She's ruining us.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a line while the FBI starts an investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday. He also added that he feared that the committee would be destroyed with the deadlock of supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will see weaknesses in getting the man who wants to be elected to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and pressure them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as he was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to take the fourth and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea deserters "Cau" with Kim
The number of South Korea deserters has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of South Unity said that 1,127 desertions occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in prices for human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang didn't make a public comment.
Normally, most Northern deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea, and it's easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrants, instead of refugees, and often returns by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Early in the month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to keep conversations focused on the stopped negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to get a Korean nuclear-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says that Brett Kavanaugh is a "histeric" and that he's not fit to work at the High Court.
The leader of the minority of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate for the High Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and that his temperament is unable to work for the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have told her it's a "histeric," Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to the witness of Kavanaugh's before the Senate Judicial Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the charges of having sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and being speechless as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the committee and said that the charges against him were a " grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that the witness in Kavanaugh showed that he could not work in the High Court, as he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when he was asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's choice, if it's confirmed, and if Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only capable of being in the High Court, but not in the court where he is now," Pelosi commented.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge in the Columbia District District Appeals Tribunal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he avoided questions as to whether he would cancel certain decisions of the High Court.
"It's no time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and expect it to look wonderful to us," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a just-justified diet: months and years of abundant fury and can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon.
He continued... "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, telling the person she was talking to, "Perhaps I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then I kept going.
It seemed bright to me."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they basically get misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a masculine majority, where I ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of a bigger woman (a cold directive that had always frightened me a little) who took me from the neckline and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
"You never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the career, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," he said as he laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said "whitewash and the seven dwarves."
Since he was late for the campaign, he was late for the fundraiser, so he promised he wouldn’t join the race if he didn’t raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found out that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" she asked.
When he made his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of collecting money and guiding voters, rather than the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he was left speechless.
"It might have been thought she had a nervous breakdown," reminded Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press.
"It might have been thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put in my grave?

How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing · Global Voices
The initial rescues of the U.S.-China trade war were overwhelming, and although it does not seem that the war should be completed soon, a distance from the countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed taxes on China's main exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, with new oranges that affect products worth $200 billion, and these oranges assume a tax tax on half of all goods that come to the United States from China.
Beijing has countered every time in the same way and recently climbed the spiders from five to ten percent for 60,000 million dollars of American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will move forward in the near future.
Getting Washington back means yielding to some demands, but publicly leaning in front of the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that begin a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had predicted," says Abigail Grace, a leading research associate centred in Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country, devastated by a war of over seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Still others are no longer associating with the Christian congregation.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's selection wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's selection has won the 2018 Ryder Cup in defeating the American selection with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times on European ground and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European selection won the crown once again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Miccelson, who fought during most of the tournament, kicked out the water in the hole by 3 16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone on all his series and became one of four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was set aside with 5&4 by less qualified player from the European Thorbjorn Olesen selection in Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5.
"I don't mean to cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so glad I got the drink back.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I could help," commented a excited Garcia after European victory.
He highlights his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost the four games he had in France and now has a career record at the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players who ever lived, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American selection fought the whole weekend to search the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
US Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I am proud of these players, they have fought.
There has been a moment this morning when we pushed the European selection.
We fought.
I take off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's to take off your hat.
We've been defeated."
