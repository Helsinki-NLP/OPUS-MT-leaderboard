A Republican Strategy to Combat the Reelection of Obama
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter to be a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In addition, Republican lawyers have identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments promulgated new laws from 2009 that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon was expanded after the November 2010 elections, which included 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced only in 2011.
New electoral laws require electors to present an identity card with photos and evidence of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce voting periods in advance, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the vote, and withdraw citizens with a legal record from voting rights.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirms in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities began to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity cards such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo cards issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required ID card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required identity card with a picture.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their identity card with photos issued by their institutions.
On the other hand, these same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two in three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican legislators sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on election day in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the recording of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have dropped the enrolment rate of new voters by 17 per cent in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other States to reduce the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, while they represented only 13% of the electors in the state.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, the white people who made up 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the Democratic governors.
U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make exercising the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democrat critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see a clear objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key States.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to assert with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present incorrect results, with false negative results or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What to make men already reluctant to pass screening tests even more.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In the U.S. studies, there was a lot of contamination among witness groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have strong recommendations.
Another study, the European study, concluded a difference in mortality between patients who had been diagnosed and those who had not.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that there were between 30 and 40% more chances of metastases if not detected.
Therefore, I recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are painless.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of cancer, by offering him the options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, and instead opting, in these cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be advised to make active monitoring and if the disease progresses, they will be given treatment.
Increasingly, precise criteria are determined to determine who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend that we pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not you should.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to assess the per and against the APS test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good habits of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is associated with 85% of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
That night is a great night for people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says the spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouragement: 10 years after giving up the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer falls by half.
Weight
Embossment and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, oesophageal, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," he added.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much, it raises the risk of getting colorectal cancer.
Carcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," it says.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive for now.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
Furthermore, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking to his family's concerns and background with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
Higgs decorticé boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole million last summer, and for reasons.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, nothing but that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been seen empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet entirely certain that it is the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we have a genuine new particle, and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a large physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain of it.
Let's just assume that this is the Higgs, because the chances of being mistaken seem slim, and let's see what this is about.
In this low world, there is a fatally inevitable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Although the physics of particles is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consists largely in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens named farms, who obey Pauli's principle wisely.
And in the other one there are bounties, a filthy band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they may and may well be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, indeed) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate themselves and to which the boson of Higgs would in some sort resemble.
These bosons, we must emphasize here, are not all as exotic beasts as we might believe.
In fact, if you get to read this chronicle, it's thanks to a bonus of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light particle" that is the "messageer" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, a little like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" comes an electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "bearers of force".
More stable field
The same goes with the Higgs boson, to this difference near that it is another field, the field of Higgs, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
However, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to excite it, it must reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, only a very large rock could climb the surface.
That is why we need a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not all particles, nor all materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be on their own on a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do it have a mass, while the others (like photon, hold) do not have it.
Now, what "can you bring" all this research, would you ask Mrs Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to examine any difference between observations and predictions of MS.
In fact, they are many who wish we could find it, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "physical new" and close some holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, not proposing any explanation for the gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the material of the Universe (re-ops!).
But no such deviations have been found in CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of this research on Mr. and Mrs. All-World's daily, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such thing.
Remember: at the beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work was going to trigger.
They questioned scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already been told to fire physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first was pulsed), in 1962 - initially the laser was rather seen as a "gadget of the lab".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, in his work on optics.
This sensor, although not at all his original intent, now serves as a "eye" for all the digital cameras in the world, and has valued the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course it doesn't mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die...
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed shortly as a bill is getting ready.
In this essential area, however, much remains to be done.
Duty tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was round had left him a repeat of two years.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half a girl, lying in his bed at the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois, from Beloeil, where he arrived the night before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents her from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Attached in front of an appetizing breakfast, he agrees to let himself help to eat, resigned.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to the strangers around him, brings him his medication, offers him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for me to be cured of diarrhea, it is humiliating," he confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"During our life, we learn that a man, it pisses up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois house.
Returning to the child's stage, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
It depends on the ability of the person to accept the regression, he observes.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, there are great moments at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them is no longer providing "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die " conscious and suffocated " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I have no desire in life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She looks forward to a final visit of her son from Italy in the coming days.
In Victor-Gadbois, we provide, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
It's palliative care, which we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home doctors.
Be at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When you die, you will agree to provide mouth care at the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar rate.
And death is part of the daily routine.
Last night, we served a beer at Mr. X, dead during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but do not look like them.
Along with a 93-year-old man who enjoyed his last family assembly in the court, well-carried in his pillows while he was being held in honor, a 36-year-old man died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.
53% of the patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois house arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the end stage of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the treatment offered to cancerians.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that causes many doctors specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law that will lead to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed out of the peaks of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing enough to ensure that everyone has the right to good palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients only want to die because they don't get the right care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are looking at their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helene Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she gave up a strong chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was stopping fighting, she told me.
Yet she told me I was done!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who want to die thank the caregivers for not having access to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Société de care palliative à domino du Grand Montréal, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians often use palliative sedation, which goes back to sleep until the patient dies, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer pretend to hear that part of suffering.
More and more, the unsatisfied patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," that means "I want to be relieved."
The implementation of this report was made possible through a Journalism Fellowship of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fund collectors and experts from the Italian Mafia relate day after day what they know about a formidable "system", mixing the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
A " industry " which cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's curious how the system crumbles since we took the big shots," ironic Jacques Duchesneau, a member of the parliament in Quebec and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the wrongful conduct of road work contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had consented only to retreat.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, hidden funding of parties and corruption of public servants.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, does he point out that the only Department of Transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," some of them saying their instincts to reach a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he added, hoping that it will "show the stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition to the police of "the Marteau Escuade" who, since 2009, would have led the Montreal sewer chart to put the soft pedal on the inflations of contracts...
Over the past few weeks, she has been conducting serial searches and charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
He is suspected of having poisoned repetitive bribes in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers on the outskirts of Montreal and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambico.
The latter made sense by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
For years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who returned the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambim sowed at all winds in the 2000s, giving over $88,000 in Canadian dollars (about €68,000) to provincial parties, especially Liberals at that time.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal collection of funds for the former Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Duty contracts inflated the costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked round the clock.
Gilles Surprising, former public works engineer, detailed it in front of the commission: in ten years, he received gifts construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and winepots, totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts that he inflated the costs.
Other road officials have admitted to fattening their leg by inflating bills from 30% to 40% by false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected in Montreal to draw the alarm bell.
Mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, to the east of the island, she rose in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she said that she "put on a thread to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and push the wrongs."
The process, she says, is "sudden but positive."
We're cleaning up the wound, but we need a proper investigation unit in Montreal and a night shift, not to see the dubious practices come back.
Just like we do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes from his side that " officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "element in the wake of the stratageme", when they did not dive into the maguille!
Estimateing 70% of the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he was ironic: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to the parties to $100 but this will not change it, according to the Government of Quebec: "As long as electoral expenditures are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He calls for a comprehensive revision of the system of public contracts and party financing: "We can't go any further; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it in their own courtyard...
"The PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you took a new size with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I'm making progress with them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements are pushing me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
It's all going very fast in the football.
But I'm not burning.
From my beginnings to the preformation center of the INF Clairefontaine at my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by step.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to fighting very high-level games.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to cope and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gave me a lot about my position.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelle, who played the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with hot clubs.
He's got a lot of big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
Then I was getting out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In League 1, Lyon took our place as our leader.
But we're still ambushed.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th finals with the way.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We first want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive at the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a great European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in length.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, the GSP provides the means for this project to be implemented.
In League 1, wouldn't winning the title, like last season, be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we're really in the heart of this title as a champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the skills to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right thing to do.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have weapons to take it.
Do you think the media are waiting for too much of the GSP?
It's normal that we expect a lot of ourselves in view of what was invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame for, it's definitely frustrating.
We wonder what people expect more.
We can never earn 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the Barcelona CF!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
Champions have been proven in the League to be able to respond.
Look at Manchester City that has not been qualified for the 8th finals since two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
In view of the money invested, we imagined you with 15 points in advance at the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boasted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have a smile saying that despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking it.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much better than it's said there's a "Zlatan dependency."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very good and he has a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves he's the Star of League 1.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he's done is really exceptional.
This moves others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with playtime.
I've seen things there, and I've been strengthened.
Today, I am able to make good games in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we must have exemplary behaviour.
What do you look at in the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We're well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The picker is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved its goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will drive the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good nul (1-1) pulled out in Spain on 16 October as a founding match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a similar match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and costs of processing between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is clear: the belief that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure trading protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from pair to pair.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the courses are recorded on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is distinguished from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The Facebook social network has also developed this type of system.
But every time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes on the network are both depositors of the book of accounts, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two electronic addresses in the form of an e-mail.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It is the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner of which, as a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hacking phase, i.e. transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before they "find" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other knots easily check that it's the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any changes would change the print.
If, to fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to 100 millionth, leaving the margin...
The challenge is also reflected in each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also notes the possibilities for money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant soldiers" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a textbook on this currency, believes a great deal about the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
Just send them an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, which ensures that thousands of users are present.
There is a general movement of questioning hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be necessary, but 2013 might be a turn," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of the success of that currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us at all.
Most of all, it is the Afghan peasants who have been punished in regard to them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, such as Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Truck and armored convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no deferral of the Taliban on Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country by fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then seen as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants beyond the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They moved into businessmen, taking over government land to resell them into land to build refugees from Iran and Pakistan, enjoying huge American subcontracts.
They were deconsiderated; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have known how to take advantage of the American broads: the leak of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are coldened by portable phones; television, and Turkish slippers that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstitution of provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state, to a strong presidential power, eliminating the position of Prime Minister who had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled in April 2014.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and already long before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been rerouted, no dam is in repair, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mining wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only there to take care of it.
Without energy to treat the iron or copper or copper on site, or means of transport to export it across the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of My Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) searching the huge Buddhist site and remaining the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, will still need to re-establish normal reports.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' school, boys' school, French university department, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural matters, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "get hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of "civilo-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, carried out, and carried out well by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, gourmands in local labour, were able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivable surfaces.
What are we going to remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would help improve local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrection by foreign groups, which farmers have told me they would like, a small, well-controlled, and direct civil aid should be maintained for them.
A Constitution to the Forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever before in the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally the full powers, it has decided to play its total.
Taking everyone short, he announced, Wednesday, that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this House two months to complete its work.
For the next two years, Egypt has been based on a provisional text, several times amended which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal scams.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delight", continuing to "deal his word" and "poor the right".
On the side of its supporters, it is ensured that it is a means of bringing an end to the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time compels the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
The use of such a precipitous vote is a matter of the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "You vote for my text, or I keep the full powers," which they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, a large Islamic majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had shut the door, believing that they could not have made their views known.
The same had been done by representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society.
In order to achieve the required quorum, 11 alternate members were added to the quorum in a timely manner last morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles have been voted on.
Some commentators were amused by the fact that one of the day's differences had been expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the constituent's pendulum was ill-regulated.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Subjects of all attention, article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom Islamic law is a major claim, hoped they could replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the Liberals answered, who saw only one communication.
For they believe that the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of the laws with the sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worrisome because "people called to decide are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy."
The fear of Liberals is also driven by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not olemas, but academics, for some trained in the French system" temple Alexis Bluet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there can be an ambiguity around section 220, because the terms used use the religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And in the future, the question might arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extended powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood submits that they are clearly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another contentious point: powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Only trials of civilians in military courts will be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
They also express their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
Blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, in particular the press.
In addition, no articles are more relevant to the protection of women, reports Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word was not found in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the head of state will show them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Centre of the World and a sea of scent await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has retained five important reasons for your return to Israel.
Go to worship the holy places
Make yourselves indispensable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone entering these "baptized foundations" will be affected by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the earth of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where the storm rested, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is at this specific place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The believers walk the Rue de la Souffrance or the Via de Croix (Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoria), where the trial was held, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the one of the Peter of the Onction and the burial.
This is where the Christian center of the world is, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree was grown used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave a few words accompanied by prayers that are then exhausted.
Travel to the highest
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, former refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering lovers can go there by their own means.
For others, a telephony takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m altitude, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
Ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods once inhabited the summit of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to almost 300 museums.
You can not visit all of them during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting who are really worthy of the diversion.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Art Museum of Tel-Aviv.
It is mainly exposed to the paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of visitors' molds and traveling overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entry is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter a total darkness.
Sparkling stars.
Then you hear the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Health and well-being
The three large Israeli seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of it offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinriums and giant aquariums.
Note: You can bathe in the Red Sea even in winter, because the temperature of the water does not fall below 21° while that of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can bathe there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below the sea level.
Azur-coloured water contains sauna and very easily retains the bathers, even those who can't swim.
The surrounding landscapes are of surreal beauty.
There is a treatment based on salted water, lemon, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also just to relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatoly and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Persée saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to "your" sign, your fate will smile.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross young married people to take pictures from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to walk in the Roman theatre, "to conquer" the fortress of the Crusades.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the people speak Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (now $1 is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
With regard to urban transport, it is mainly the buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the week of work starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only cashier food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made of both milk and meat.
It offers a wide range of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk, but also lobster, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, mullus peas balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no straying dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of well-nourished cats that walk around the air.
We can see them sleep at night on the roofs of parked cars.
These feline people love passing places and don't refuse to get them fixed.
The rental of a car varies according to the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 per day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs on average 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists went to Land Promised from January to October 2012, 51 per cent more than in 2010, prior to the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MEPs and human rights activists argue about what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that each migrant worker must pass a Russian examination.
At the moment, this rule concerns only those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises that tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, the knowledge of the language must be validated, but also the knowledge of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate its language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language are exempt.
Nor are persons who have obtained certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 concerned by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Russian-language Institute Pouchkine, the People's Friendship University, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question in the press many times: what will this give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migrant service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery to work".
Many speak about the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
The problems arise for unprofessional migrants, without training, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, certified Sebelev, the future migrant is destined to cross dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will torment themselves for months without food and paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive numerous complaints from our migrants.
"In them, one thing is promised to them, and when they arrive, we cheat on them, they take their passport, and they don't reach the expected salary," confirmed the Head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Chapiov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to come to earn money in Russia believe that they know not only the language of the country they want to go to, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course it is not their fault, but their woes: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow would only be a viable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equiping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people start to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, trust them.
"You feel drowsy and drowsy."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants with legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defend enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 nautical miles.
And then, you can get a false registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have registration, hence cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," told journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Be quick, don't hurt and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by federal migration service employees.
Falsified paper comes from an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the examination task had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is twice and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of the power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible simply to buy these "paper stickers".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination of the first time to attend language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether they are shooting at weddings or killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullet weapons in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the gun-port permit from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the State Douma soon.
Everyone is not happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "cut the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net, in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon "that foolish hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is minimal, said to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and specialist in the crime for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in police services over a period of six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil arms laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, we can find any weapon in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is provided through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking arms commands
The first is "the military track", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those that are stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen in police stocks and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols leave for sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often experienced explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires have been deliberately triggered to conceal the deficit," says the former military.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition in the international market and break down arms in the black market, especially in Moscow," said one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large part of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"We find local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organized the supply," the former military added.
Where do the guns come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was formed in 2011 by the Problem Analysis and Study Centre for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, the criminal files and the public data of the arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain researchers, come from the army and from law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "because of employees whose work is related to arms," the report says.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from military conflict sites, 14 per cent are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5 per cent are from "hidden missiles".
A salesman and a cabinet consultant who has asked to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one has purchased the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, he said, sellers will look for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys through a teaching unit, for example a TT pistol.
We deliver it to her by going through the merchandise through a grid.
"He transports it in the city and sells it for 900 € by unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be elucidated, they buy control from illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
"As in a luxury shop "
The seller and buyer are generally found through knowledge.
I consulted websites, blogs, until a guy shows up and proposes to come to Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "coin" to market.
The price of the gun, I got it on the spot.
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are vendors in the markets, but there must also be a saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I'm buying even a pair of American fists with someone I trust.
He only gives it to me because he knows I won't.
The young new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former Military Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schematics, he said, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury shop," the military remembers.
There's no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we're going with the forest vendor and we're setting up a target.
"We let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A boutique from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy "for different uses" weapons.
For this, we don't need any documents and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," it says on the website "Buying a gun or a machine gun."
Users leave their demands and ask questions.
And we sell to the minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (conserved spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a vast network of false sites and collects people who want to buy weapons of combat.
People fall on food like hungry wolves and then find to exploit coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I have heard about this type of scheme: the site is usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," says the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by applying on the site, you can find yourself without a gun and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has spread a vast network of false sites and collects people who want to buy weapons of combat.
"People are falling on food like hungry wolves and then they are again exploiting coal in Siberia," he says.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, according to experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a Gun" association, you can buy a Makarov pistol for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of the long-term warehouses by the direction of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Department's official data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes overall decreased by 7% in Russia to 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs fell by 7.8%.
United States: Fast-food and supermarket employees are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier's job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave will grow rapidly or grow short.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In parallel with the increase in the modest wages of basic employees at Walmart and in the fast food chains, the organizers of the demonstrations want to get the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at the time when a flood of balances caught millions of inhabitants fell on America and sometimes triggered swindlers.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their position to organize strike pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in stores of society whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart sells everything: from layers to hunting rifles through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of Walmart's underpaid employees run their races only at their place of work.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example the lack of lifting trucks or portable scanners.
Participants from the "Black Friday" events called for an increase in wages, complaining that the price of the company's medical insurance had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who earns $9.5 per hour, it's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists from the California University of Berkley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost the $3.2 billion group.
It is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred the entire salary increase on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store would come back to them at 46 cents more.
They will spend in a year only $12.39 more than now.
Walmart's supporters noted with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the stores from 8:00 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items a second.
Its cash registers have made 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
Dan Fogleman's spokesperson assured in an interview at the left Huffington Post site that in all of Walmart's "less than five" employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "com-operation among so many others" by the organizing union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not appreciated, that is why they are not yet implemented) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of servings and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage under federal legislation and New York is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food increases over time, but little by little, on average, its basic employees earn in New York $8.90 an hour.
Nobody touches less than them in this town.
For me it's inconceivable to live with this money in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living in their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal Forum there are comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
Protesters who launched the move Thursday at 6:30 am near McDonald's of the 40th Street and on Madison Avenue required that fast-food cashiers and cooks be paid at least $15 per hour, a multiplication of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for trade unions to be established in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing the protestors of a union by beatings or dismissals.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, getting rid of fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main features is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held close to several other fast food chains.
The flagship moment of the protest was the mid-day gathering near McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces to sell billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!"
Protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in view, including the candidate for Mayor Bill De Blasio's position, who stated that "we must all support the workers of the fast restoration so that they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important event in the fast restoration sector throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people participated there, not all of them were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is now difficult to tell whether this mass movement spark will make small ones.
"At the moment, we can only be able to deceive the brain"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing the reality increased through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the Director of the Interactive 3D Technology Group at the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already of old history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the naked air, by creating virtual spaces open.
- Can you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine, and at the same time we are trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
The humanity as a whole has remained for the moment in pixels on flat screen and sometimes on touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in ordering the gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has made the physical interaction, a lot of things are going on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The seizure of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for now, not really.
We are trying to change this and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems based on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, we need to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
We cannot say that it is panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in his niche.
For example, to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we are considering gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, limited gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet held by the hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: gesture + voice.
- Is that so?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this cane?
You would do it with the word and with the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
For example, it can be laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If you're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the present generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
Of course it would be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to algorithm designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind, according to the axes X and Y, but also Z.
The speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, has given the sensor touch a regular treatment delay between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how it affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would really need this kind of device in my work, but I don't need to touch it, to have more executives to the second.
- But don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a regular sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or press it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As much as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from a point of view of the day-to-day use of enhanced reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitory" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass from glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that's what makes them strong (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point to the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the reality increased is the seventh perceived in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be the addition of touch sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of air breath on the ends of the fingers.
There are also wrist straps that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work with perspectives.
- And you tried to deceive the brain?
To make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will take a long time to get hurt: the way to make someone believe physically in a very small space that he walks in an almost endless open space - we are working on the concepts of race rugs (more to see those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the time being, we can only averagely deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Avant-garde petersbourgeois" dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already hosted prominent actors from the art scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and who have found recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the alien painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known as Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed red that you can cross near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the trendy parties and varnishes.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds, regardless of their place of exposure.
He is one of the natively social and philosophical petersbourgeois accountants, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the Petersbourgeois vanguard in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes its inhabitants smile and puts them in good mood.
He has recently taken into his hands a organ of Barbarie and has become the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you walk the city all red and not yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a sewing machine specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even though in society, anything that is not gray evokes aggression and a negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Culture Palace where my works were.
I understood it was my way.
So the wave of the old unofficial painters was passed and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I started to associate with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except words.
It was important for me to find myself at the centre of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must meet.
In 1995, I took the place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the petersbourgeois bohemian bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour coming with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy-to-back songs in mowing jerseys, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, a fashion composer today.
When the group started to happen live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg did not encourage bad broadcasts before the time of Halifax Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was at the time that his great career began, but his basic education and training was ours that he received them.
Galérie "D137", Club "Griboiedov": these are the implications of the Clinique.
Our employees went there as regular.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was held in the press: it was the "The personalities of our city".
I was called "Pein of the Year," and that's when my kingdom ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a reconnaissable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have very strong news and acuity.
I'm going to have an exhibition programmed "The Russian Museum Through Clowns".
Clowns belong to an untimely category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's scary to be like this.
But with the clowns, it's all gone, the tragic fall.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to scratch him in the trunk instead.
And the lie will be wiped out by disguise.
- We've recently seen you in the role of the organ player in Barbados.
Who else I can play.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be careful, delicate, liqueur.
Disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into flocks, the bohemian supporters loved one thing, the nevi another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communitys, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everybody.
Today, we have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhalov!
- They're people we threw who come to see, it's the sexual and social side that's working.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and after the account it's less management, money, all gone.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to cheat them, not to spoil the life.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, we often confuse ideas.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused the money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not all can work in culture.
Under the reign of good czars, it was not like this, the czars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are disparate, because there is a need for higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and lead them to a path.
At present, it is the "king of taste" that blooms.
The same Eratta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all of contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time growing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious who will see exhibitions, concerts.
In us, this layer is very fine.
We have to make art fashionable as it was in the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the Saint Petersburg Fellowship
Docking in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with terrians on board go looking for a relief planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how can we continue to make our species live on or on a relief planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, it would be only guessing.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICH).
If the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the temperature on Venus surface is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitudes or on Venus' orbit... in space.
We began to take an interest in the questions of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Another half century ago, we were experimenting with plants.
Four generations of small peas grown on orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then, we put on the orbit of insects, small drosophiles breeding flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to the space to see how an embryo was developing in the grip.
We get a totally normal chick at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a support, it has to get on its legs and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
When no support was found, the chicks were disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die after four days.
"We evicted their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, finding the failure of experience with chicks in space.
The last biological miniature arch with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only embark on same-sex species.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetuses in space.
In principle, nothing was discovered in the supernatural.
"They were still biosatellites and then it's the only experience. You have to do this kind of research," said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions have not yet been performed directly in space.
It's not a big deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is capable of creating a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not achieved for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organization is what humanity has most precious.
Our moose flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would take after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered that question," said Vakhtang Vachnadzé, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been on orbit twice and even worked in extra-vehicle environments, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have little, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy seed after long flights.
"And if they're longer, this even poses a danger during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, Soviet Union hero and Russian hero Valeriya Poliakov.
Yet, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in non-flottability, cosmonauts lead to extra-vehicle exits.
The water imitates the weigher.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
Small amphibians seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic liquid of his mother's womb, it is easier for him to then get used to water.
It is in principle logical, because from birth to its first bath, it spends only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In other words, if for the child who has just been born the apprentice is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In an airtight, the muscles of the belly, the basin atrophy very quickly, the push capacity of the baby is lost.
All right, let's just ignore this by leaning on the delivery simulators.
Of course we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will come to get him out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite you to think about this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the Earth's attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress a baby like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a totally disabled child ", provides for the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will come true, when the Terrians will travel on their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institute for Public Finance Control) said: "Control of the independent pseudo-work (Czech's " Švarc system") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and high-quality legislation but is in the process of applying it.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the Vice-President of the Higher Institute for Public Finance Control, said in an interview with Aksuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, it is what is lacking in us," Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint monitoring by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " Švarc system " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS is not going to import contractors with controls; is it permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority responsible for inspecting compliance with the law," says Kala.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the public procurement legislation in these two countries was compared.
What was he really asking about?
This is parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as practice.
We have gathered all this together and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more severe and better quality", however, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to continuously develop more and more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote itself to the enforcement of the law itself.
How can this project actually help you and what is the result for you?
A common control of this kind should just contribute to what we stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, this will not necessarily be achieved.
It may be that this system is so submerged by the paperwork, that those who search for its faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode of organization?
As far as institutions are concerned, ISC also operates there the Bundesrechnungshof which is organised similarly, it also has a somewhat different council, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way .
Skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has courses of this type at the level of the different Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which is consistent with our state resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities at home are controlled there at the Länder accounts prices.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it cannot be said to be doing better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, probably not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we consider as a model is also faced with a wide range of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, right?
With regard to national legislation, what has the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant for you as an institution?
Since this amendment has come into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we're doing a posteriori checks, we have to have a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, at the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new tool to "detect the risks of mismanagement" with which we have gone to the crisis of nearly 14,000 public procurement - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed, as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
So do you see the adoption of this law as an advantage or an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more severe and cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulation, the claimant (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programs) forced controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the contract law meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really helpful, then, to make the law stricter this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system, but do not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put greater pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to that?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the SDO would not import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority responsible for inspecting and demanding compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and authorize it," but he can't say that we're going to act as if nothing was.
The Contracts Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, and this is precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
Roads are frozen, but most of them remain practical.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
The network, however, remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, roads were practical this morning, but by frozen and snowy places.
Temperatures have dropped and fluctuated between -5 ° and -10 ° C, but they are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfalls have ceased in the region and it remains in the plains only a fine layer of snow.
The ridges of the Monts metalliferes (Krušné hory) are, however, covered about 30 centimeters of snow.
The data from the regional road maintenance service show that due to fog, visibility was reduced by locations.
The R6 and national roads in the region are now available without difficulty.
However, vigilance remains to be placed, for example on certain bridges where the coating can be frozen and sliding.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
Still remains on some of their sections of the ice-cold snow debris and by traffic-torn places.
Especially in areas at altitude, drivers need to be more vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Kralové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in East Bohème are threatened by the formation of mirrors and that traffic-tracked snow layers can be found on roads in mountainous areas and at altitudes.
Road maintenance services alert drivers against the risk of forming mirrors in areas of the Pardubice region at altitude.
There may be verglas in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on the departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a traffic-tagged snow layer is present on roads in the highlands.
In East Bohemian times, time will be dry, most often cleared, with possible cloudy passages.
It will have a low wind and temperatures will generally vary between -3° and +1°C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are now feasible, although, in places, greater vigilance is needed and adaptation to weather conditions is needed.
It freezes this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the recent snowfalls and the subsequent cooling, some channels of communication can be frozen by places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what information from the regional road maintenance service indicates.
The D5 motorway is practically without difficulty, however, the road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in Pilsen-South district and Tachov district.
Departmental and third-class tracks are wet and in this case warning against frozen sections is applied.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers entering the areas of the Olomouc region at altitude must today have a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the "Červenohorské sedlo" neck and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
Snowfalls forced road maintenance personnel to travel to the field at night; according to road traffic services, more than three centimeters fell in the Šumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most of the roads are practical without difficulty.
" On the heights of Šumperk district there are snow remnants.
Drivers travelling in the direction of Jeseník must expect to meet the so-called "Červenohorské sello" a thick and soft snow layer "now told ČTK the head of road maintenance services in Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník have also been on site at night; according to them, after chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc, roads are easy to apply, however, drivers in the district of Šternberk should pay attention to sections in forest areas with wet soils.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
Since this morning, the road maintenance services of Northern Bohemian have reported several difficult sections.
Data from the police show that in addition to some areas covered by snow or glass, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústtecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at a lower altitude, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south-east of Bohemian Central Plateau, there are, on the contrary, no problems and roads are generally dry.
No traffic problems have been reported for the time being.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of verglas, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow fountain during the day, clear sky and freezing during the night.
From the main traffic routes, difficult conditions are also reported on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of snow until they reach the pavement.
Šimon Hornest said, "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these alarming news, the kind of trap we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we're in a lot of trouble, and we're said to be the only group able to collect a rest of the positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you set up a unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project to our readers in more detail?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years now.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11.10 a.m.
On 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end at the time of the end of the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati in the peaceful ocean, on a time zone in advance of 12 hours over us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled "End of the Cancelled World" (Czech "Kneg světa zrušeno").
Is it already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it during these charitable concerts?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all interpreters in the three concerts.
Hymnes will also join at a certain time as part of a very unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also played the main role of Jesus in the video, Xindl X sings there too...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show, because we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We are striving to make them actively participate in these projects.
It has proved that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will benefit from these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studento training centre that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on as part of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association for six years.
Teachers regularly go to students at Jedličk in the Jedličv Institute and offer activities that interest them and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to attend classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several groups of music and interpreters come up on stage at each of these concerts?
Based on what criteria, do you have the choice?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will be on stage.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the Prague Spring; there too, we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic house in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It doesn't look so bad at first.
We have five electrical wheelchair members whose equipment has to travel by lot, of course we also pack a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
Until now everything has been more or less always well done, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for persons with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have your experiences been so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we were just witnesses in Moscow only at this point is still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very barely accessible to persons with disabilities; there it is not common yet that a person moves alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it clear to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association striving to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
What do we still need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements still depend on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with heavy disabilities move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not, however, very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather contrary to the point of progress!
Public respect and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us.
For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, so let's go back a few years, what led you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And because I'm a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created an activity of music.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lá a Angelovič said, we have lost control of the situation (reverses).
Is success all that's happened in the last few years if I'm not mistaken?
True, creating links with known singers and actively working to promote the group has helped us.
We understand that if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's grants, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The business show is full of things that copy each other.
In some ways, it makes sense: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts for a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I would like to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But compassion is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
They are people who can live a whole life and thrive, provided they have the means, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not only an advance for them but for the whole society.
Is your success not also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and demand discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people come home with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many were there already in 1998?
One, Lá a Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, there's nothing there.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the planned day of the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012 beginning from 21 hours.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relays when the song of the band The Tap Tap " End of the Canceled World " will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to gather financial resources (at CZK 25 million) to equip the Multifunctional Training Centre Studeo located in Prague in Jedlička Institute.
The price for a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the presale of the tickets is opened in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, the road from Poland to outer space started much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always encounter understanding.
For example, I would like to refer to the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, in which he presented ideas drawn from his cutting-edge work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics ".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold listeners and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie Prize in France and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of the world-renowned astronaut, in particular his contribution was rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the hidden side of the Moon.
From 1925 a drachma was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocketed engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
Nor is it clear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the drasin.
The only information known about this drama is the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komorka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the retained documents that this research had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photographic hunting rocket, drawn by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects aimed at military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the interim scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Advisory Committee Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
The committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautic Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a company in the November 1954 issue of the Problem newspaper, in which there are four more detailed articles on aeronautical.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create an astronomical society
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the international Astronautic Federation (created in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first PTA President, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He kept his job until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version was built, RM-1A, and during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 flight tests were started in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have reached up to 14.5 km and served to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of equipment was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
The entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later should also be mentioned.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in the space exploration of artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The repeal of the Public Use Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public utility work.
This decision raised a lively discussion in public opinion.
It is certainly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This specifically means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital coupled with a fearful financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour price (salaries) generate pressure on prices.
The following meaning must be stated: a producer strives to import low-selling goods which are resistant to economic competition by making the price of the competitor more expensive, with the aim of removing a larger share of the market and thereby increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either to transfer production abroad, either to buy at low prices or to disappear. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and hence responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the State necessarily increase.
This situation intensifies the perfect will of the gentlemen of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create a situation in the various economies in which governments in different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments place their own people on the mercy of private capital without taking account of social collapse.
This is reflected mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the private capital price diktat, particularly in the area of wages.
This occurs on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other by restricting employees' rights in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the RFA, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years that cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is obliged to pay an extra to achieve the minimum vital.
Such a scandal has, for example, been updated in the case of employees working as an assistant to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the Member States in the south of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as in the 19th century) or to live with wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
Here we must ask ourselves the following question: Where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also concerns all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue, to the point, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly argues that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must ask ourselves, then, whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not govern today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the whole state.
The answer to that question is certainly yes.
The evidence is that there is a nearly all-powerful lobby in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemned but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national departments delegate the development of bills to firms of lawyers that are closely related to industry.
These bills are then adopted at the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as the Western-type constitutions say, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies oriented towards liberalism are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State had long been in full delicacy and the functions were attributed by violence.
The blows of pot-wine, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The sub-tables and corruption would proliferate without limits and the people would go to the elections with already sold voices ... ... ... "The honest people did not seek to obtain office, it results once the state stayed for 8 months without consuls" ... "It really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appianos had in mind the Pompeate, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in the past, the current company is based on the preference of personal profit, with no regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
Today, as in the past, this has resulted in a decade-long decline of elites, with no effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems can be considered to benefit liberal-type democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human losses, the humanitarian and social crises that we are now witnesses and the crimes against humanity as we know them from the past and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Use Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international and internal European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase citizens' influence on the government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: chaos laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never can," says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the refrain is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be war," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer's wife Amschel Rothschild on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some take sides with Israel, arguing that they have a right to self-defense and putting Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, calling on the racism of the State of Israel, genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is victimized, in his waves of recurrent killings; all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a "last curtain" point of view, on which the tensions that have been taking place for more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) are mainly in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely from the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily the history of a struggle for power.
At every time, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or owe their actions to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that generates certain powers has not been able to do so in a single generation.
Among families with astronomical wealth is especially distinguished by the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the dust (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
It's not written about them.
Of course.
From the 90s of the 19th century, they acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) to put an end to the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts to which they were mixed and which had always meant strengthening their power, increasing their wealth or both.
They have major participations in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they have not yet had such participations (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after Iraq's invasion of 5, after the overthrow of Kadhafi only 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Everyone who tried to stand up to this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Central Bank of America of Rothschild and began to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I hear well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to try a trial against the EDF for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for global power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a free-mason initiated to the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, in particular the British, and the third was to reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a number of slaves are sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent the recurrence of crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After successfully unleashing the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to Habsburg to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war suddenly ended with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Czarist Russia) and was followed by the mortal of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier launch of the second world war, the bankers have allowed politicians to create a situation of late conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany of pharaohs war reparations generating the conditions of radicalization of the impoverished masses (then it is enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing a finger of the culprits, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, to create a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (which it actually holds) of five columns to set fire to dust and trigger war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspired to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of the Historical Jude with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the basis for the mass migration of Jews into Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers initially held it; or whether everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war reparations imposed on Germany were the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit up a firehouse that could lead to a third world war.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population in the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of strife and chaos, not only in this country, but at international level (it is enough to see how people divide themselves sharply between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where another evil generates another evil according to a circle of endless violence and where, at the very origin of all, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
We need to make a difference here between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as we do, the international bankers are offering people only their own candidates to the elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascist politicians, loyal to international bankers, who do everything in order to launch a war with Iran, who could, because of the country's accession to Shanghai's cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) extend to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls Ormuz Strait by which it passes 20% of all world oil (this naval corridor has only a width of 2 miles) and generates a destruction of the world economy.
What light now appears to David Rockefeller's words in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which any new born-up appears to implant at birth an electronic chip making it completely controlled.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry a red iron mark on their hands or forehead, so that they may neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of its name.
It must be understood that the person who has good sense counts the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number is the man and it is six hundred sixty-six."
The film Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a number of protesters, including Islamist students, attacked the American Embassy of Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, even worsened later by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The sequestrian diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States creates a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle greatly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped the embassy.
After complicated periods, they found themselves in the Ambassador of Canada's residence.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team to track down a large-scale science-fiction film.
Combination of genders
Tony Mendez's exfiltration expert plan requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation were long kept secret, and the film was based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - for example, in the Ocean's high trilogy, twelve and thirteen.
The ambiances follow: sequences of documentary-style Tehran (in the sequences under title are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been rewritten in the film, there are no major differences),
Hollywood's lighter passages, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to reboot his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected actor and his acting game stopped triggering ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long film after the dark police officer " Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his home town, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy fall is impressive by its clarity that also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a history page is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in fictional scenes (the false shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions to too many places
The director had to be content with a subject offering only a few touching scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It goes well, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is removed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway is quite drawn by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated nature, due to the need to show too many events to too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-ops, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from that, alone in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself see with a moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 70's.
He drives the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a still history, in a certain way, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscients, he does the business.
Rules for blowing balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public survey of the most absurd banking costs, has now decided to launch the competition of the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has been considering, in recent times, adopting a 40-percent quota of women for the management of large European companies has been at the root of our decision," said the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher, for the newspaper Právo.
Among the absurdities mentioned, for example, there is already the European Court's recent decision to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they are objectively at lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other idea as incredible as "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio-components to fuels, which have adverse environmental consequences, or the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small quantity of a hazardous substance or also the directive on the size of chicken cages, resulting in increased egg prices.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the fact-ban of using the term "hard to tart" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas must be 14 cm in size.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (so the Czech Republic is currently imposing the requests of its banks threatening to use its veto rights).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, the origin of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonising non-homogenous national standards that complicated trade.
The rules on fruit and vegetables have been simplified despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives result in a waste of food.
The first price may be awarded in this investigation to the EU Regulation of last year that it should be included on balloons that indicate that children under 8 years of age should not be inflated without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American investigation that balloons are among the toys the first cause of child deaths by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age who are to blow in fair trumpets.
In us too, we have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is rather absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone with an official role within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Letzez Fair" association of Liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server appointed, in addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food supplies in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then goes beyond, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and risk, therefore, a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants.
However, these ideas do not originate from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have the sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund."In the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) said.
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and as a result of the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found full stocks that it had subsequently had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for the award of grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which was specifically intended to be used to draft applications for grants from Brussels.
The EU states: "Ci common regulations are rare".
While the regulations often give rise to criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the field of its overall development deserve more praise.
More serious is, for example, the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries in the Union, fights in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (fights which it does not always win) arouses strong emotions in Czechs.
If, after six years of fighting against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomucké tvar.žky", as regards the term "Tuzemskýrum" dating back to our 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar, not beet sugar, can be called rum.
The official list of registered EU products includes worldwide cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck Massepain or Parme ham, Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohořelice and Třeboň carps ("Pohořelický a Třeboěský kapr") and Žatec hoplon ("Žatecký chmel").
The Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and the cakes called "Hořice " ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, Senator Okamura says
Senator, how is the idea of being presented in the presidential elections?
It is not to be a senator or president who counts for me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been looted for the last twenty years, that thieves are not under locks and taxes and the age of retirement are increasing.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that doesn't please, then I try to bring a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and am independent, I am a member of no party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or Senate elections.
You have entered the Senate but you have quickly set off for the Castle (N.D.T.: Chair seat).
Do you not turn your back on those who have chosen you?
I've always said that I'll be in the battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Afterwards, I indicated that if I was elected senator, I would present myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that enables me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the largest influence and the largest mandate.
The problem is not only that, as a nation, we are at the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we are stalking those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition, the press breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I have been abducting journalists or that I have been the counsellor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have begun the battle for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [CZK].
You have to change the law to that end.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I put pressure on tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won the cause.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or right with a good project, it is clearly denied and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of any party, I am much more likely to gain the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorization and dogma partisans, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you think of yourself as a man on the right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people put me on the left instead.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we were moving forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right but that they gather people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I also act impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken of them.
But without the support of the parliament, you have only slogans left.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them at my camp in order to impose it.
If I was elected as president, it would not be a problem to re-transmit my request to the presidents of Parliamentary parties on live television to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
Then they should possibly explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuse, political pressure will be possible.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, it was obtained through the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, without ambiguity, being an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person cannot make a difference, that is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to also attend the Senate elections.
I met with Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fraud in the bush.
I introduced myself because people are really disgruntled but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, for the most part, gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial resources.
I don't have any money either for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I value about 60 million of my personal property.
In Prague I have a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a child's dream: I always liked James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You're driving to Aston Martin, you have a 60 million worth heritage and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I owe myself?
I've already invested 2 million and a half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign fees are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example paying my son's English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I'm not going to vote.
So you're going to continue your business to live?
Didn't you say you'd turn your activities into deaf?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a contractor?
I would win and continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the cabinet MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince themselves, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of newly erected books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it is very futuristic, at last something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig told us, a pass on the lower street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large neighbouring company, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
Today, no one's doing his best in one of these regular libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The commune of 80,000 souls shows the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniature painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities have realized that there was only one way to get their hands on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from Rotterdam MVRDV's Architects' Office, master of audacious baton diagrams and creator of spirited and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its usual flegme and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a squeezing on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at themselves, bewildered and hoisting their shoulders, Maas, faced, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and finished his speech backed up by activist arguments by one: "very common!"
Here it is, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain has landed.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few buildings and houses for a total of 50 houses.
Early November, the Book Mountain received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
That is how this small terne village, which so far had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a mayor of a juicy laideur, whose white facades invite to think that they sheltered a dairy, has enriched a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in his history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you soak the floor of the building in the discovery of its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the ground in Dutch brick and the elegant reverberators speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking for public banks, dogs and small boys and girls playing at the ball.
And all books, books, and more books.
"Normally, library rays are located along the facade and in the middle there is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We have completely upset the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been properly constructed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes shaded, sometimes balustraded, sometimes climbing ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardy building don't want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in an agricultural business.
In the Netherlands, for years the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thickness is used as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The membrane finish is used for one or two seasons, then you can discard it.
For the library, the membrane was first compressed in such quantities in plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 metres, the literary café offers us an impressive view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and pot ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute mainly to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in the field of ecology," Trouborst says.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior, even the days of beautiful weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted through the glass façade serves as a sunscreen, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores are responsible for the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the septic scientist mentioned above, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there, too.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has helped to fill the gaps in the library which was not yet completely garnished (now it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays overflow everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
In this way, MVRDV has achieved the master discipline that is called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new literary history page.
Even though she may appear young and uneducated.
This is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose abstention in voting on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think she doesn't support the American position either.
Germany wanted to affirm its independence, however, without being too critical to Israel.
At the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain in the vote on the establishment of an area of air exclusion.
Finally, NATO imposes this measure.
Is Germany having difficulty adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so as to be defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of consistent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore clash with several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find that role, but they're on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or Great Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It expresses the desire to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national dossiers.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position regarding the conflict in the Near East and abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important developments in the Near East, especially in the Gulf countries.
This is why Berlin must take care not to strike public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, as it is not solely unilateral relations.
But this is, at any rate, a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany undermine relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will only be respected.
Germany thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the views differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the U.S. domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showing great understanding of the European position.
But given the country's political configuration, of course, the government cannot publicly defend its position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem so.
If you observe the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from engulfing enthusiasm for Netanyahou's policy.
Does Germany experience difficulties in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners on the other?
I don't think it's easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today that is not the case.
They cannot therefore enter a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will play a locomotive role in the future and will move Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not simple for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they have to play a role that makes them more independent.
Is Germany playing a role as a major player on the international stage, and does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or is it still difficult to assume leadership roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a more important role.
Looking at, for example, the crisis of the euro, it is noted that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed of very varied neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only decreasing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this gap, while who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're less appreciated, it's life!

"Market Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well known brands all over the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that no complaint can be made by the company bearing the name.
And even if she could, it's not certain that she would gain cause.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's firm specializing in violating property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators need only a few extra letters in order to record their trademarks.
So, instead of Gucci, we register Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also duly copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports articles.
Pattloch opens a classifier in which the records made with the Beijing Trademarks Office are located.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the Zegna DF Puma brand, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriateting part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, shopping centres are found on several floors that sell practically only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: its commanders charge it to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", as a parent.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are designated to marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say there's nothing to blame for.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of justice amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive light products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest-growing market.
However, it is not easy to erase the dubious registrations of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlikely, he may even be obliged to pay money to the plagiarism because he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, sometimes the law of the jungle dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's buyer, used before a blue and white logo that remembered BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost itself against the plagiars of Hong Kong and Singapore that had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing, however, admits that there were some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would have spent the last year of an "emergency situation in the course of work at a found normality".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type have been closed, which represents a 75% increase over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain at the office.
Deal cost-cost
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the MCO received more than 1.4 million trademark filing applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and it means that China is located for the tenth consecutive time in the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have counted 1.8 billion yuan of registration right.
In other words, each registration reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components was suspended.
However, the issuer was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wenzler, president of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The Trademarks Office therefore rejected the objection of the Munich.
Freudenberg has, of course, gained cause from the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until today.
The Watchfulness Is Set
Today, the case is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he added: "The procedure is long, difficult and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs; the archive service has even had to review the acts of the last 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large six-digit euro sum" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see for ourselves," Wentzler confides.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow up to Europe.
This would be the case if copyists in this region would ensure the exploitation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the deposit.
Wenzler adds: "Warning is putting."
Pattloch and advises German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
According to them, it is not enough to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should rather "record in China as well all that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler said.
Otherwise, costs can be much more important than registration costs.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licence rights to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as explained by Wentzler.
Or then we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: tap foot, sing, help
The Imbongi choral repeats to Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
Here's the story of a link that travels much more than a distance of 8.733 kilometers.
First, we hit the foot: the cowboy boots, basketballs, scarves for ladies and moccasins for men are looking for the rhythm by hitting the foot floor. Very fast, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers slowly expand - high, low, tenor and soprano -, they take, stink and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years old came from genetics in human medicine to man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every choristo has different words, all in a very exotic language: the zoulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Helped to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros at least, we can become sponsors.
This money guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at gogo center.
Imbongi means a storyt storyteller or even a praise singer.
No one can speak the Bantu language commonly in this area, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choral repeats songs in this foreign language that she has brought to Germany to now return to her native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometres by flight of Heidelberg bird, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is located Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw huts or land and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can see on a smaller scale the ills that plague Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of half-infection.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is carrying the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in mid-30s.
On a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis saw mainly many children in the street who were not only lacking parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without school diplomas, there is quite no prospect.
At first, it was only a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal per day.
But just one year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since been working almost professionally with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial ISTs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhea (or gonorrhea).
Common ISTs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pub and gala pubs belong to parasitic ISTs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and hummingbirds often appear in men who have sexual intercourse with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sex between men is the cause of at least four cases of syphilis out of five reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungic), blennorrage and human butterfly virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, about 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections is observed than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections concern young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human butterfly virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause aggression in genital organs, urinary pain, white loss, low-vent pain, and the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but do not protect 100%.
The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close bodily contact.
The experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes sex partners should pass regular reviews.
Most fast-deposited ISTs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, donations, but especially to the funds that the chorists collect through their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example, in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, so called the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
An orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed to a safe place at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare meals every day for over 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the support of the US health organization PSI, the association has organized an HIV testing for many residents.
This is not of itself, because although the disease is visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his wives 14
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that touches sexuality."
It's rather curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These attitudes sanctioned by the State, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers also spread the virus across the country.
But we find condoms at every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi chorists travel together every two or three years in South Africa and sing full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many of the residents of the tip of the black continent still know the time of apartheid.
The bus full of white singing in African language is a sign of recognition such that it generates not only good humor and joy, but sometimes also tears a tear to a few redoutable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the cheerleaders visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," people say there.
And after a 8.733 km bird-fly trip, back to Heidelberg, in front of these chorists who tap the foot in the Bergheimer Straße repeat room, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the Mercury planet.
The ice layer could be up to 20 meters thick.
The American Space Agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe provided evidence of the existence of ice cover in the planet's region permanently plunged into the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or maybe from asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one links the discovery of water with the hypothesis of a life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can be up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other vital elements of life have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unknown to the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet naine Cerès.
Like Pluto, which orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Cerès is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink spots, more difficult to identify, are the "new-born" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars are born, called "W5", a very romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flash of a dying star.
The circle in the form of beignet consists of elements that the star projects when she dies.
In the huge Trifide, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, also called "the seven sisters", can be observed naked at night.
However, the telescope enhances the colors.
On this infrared photo, the Helica nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years in the constellation of Verseau.
His appearances with a land continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular color.
Only the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and most clean photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the dye, the photographs of the spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula of Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years.
Trifide's name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), as three dust tranées divide the heart shining from the star's birthplace.
Astronomicals photographed the premixes of a cosmic carambollage in Serpentaire's constellation: 400 million light-years of the Earth, the nucleus of two fusion galaxies rush each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you do not like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "austral firewheel".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation of Cephée.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years and consists of dust grains that are ten percent smaller than the common domestic dust.
This photo has been developed from optical and radiographic clichés taken by different telescopes.
We can see there the circle of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars on our lactated path.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, are also constantly creating young stars at 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with bright rays and through a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our gaze on the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilée used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to thicken and thanks to them, it has been possible to see still further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Observatory of Mount Palomar near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, in the United States, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the vertical angle level, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great light collection capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo Radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope is 305 meters in diameter.
Any person who owns a computer can help the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing to the computing power of its machine.
View on the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clichés by 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They planted two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that watches the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of the distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space at the earliest in 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
The telescope will include the task of finding the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury also houses ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Mercury Pole.
For decades, radar data indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh mountains is a romanticized one.
The small bus runs along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms around the road.
Everything is green and fertile, almost to be believed in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where we see the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh, about which we don't know much, unless they speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and they have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastron with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, as the road only has one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilatea Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year, there will be here the oldest people's festival in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, the only such museum in the world.
The life of about eight tens of Talysh in the region is over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a picture of black and white.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
Having a child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Şerali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no act of birth.
And when we think that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a girl.
Would Şerali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about man at the great age of Central Asia.
" Surprisingly old people also live in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the absence of documents, without the fact that there was no civil record.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, it is true that people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of that country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri Tourist Guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, believes that this is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that foods rich in calories of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people's youth? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see in the entire Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground next to a shop, whose contents are untiringly beaten.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long grown up.
Two little children also squat in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped cabinet glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long braids of a dark blonde that his son reveals to us proudly.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas.
All my life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she told us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of propaganda is surprising in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the nation's paternal figure, a man who has yet ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham subsequently succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (about the same amount in euro) monthly for retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life in the region.
And perhaps that Mirzayeva's long-swimming son is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on the sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not without words filled with emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but especially for Christian Copts, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
For all the members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi stated, almost by making excuses, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and broadened his powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD at the U.S. University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overturned?
The 234 items quickly written by the predominantly Islamic assembly of 100 people on a 15-hour night force tour are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
This was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use vague wording and the legal margin of manoeuvre that stems from it to apply a more strict interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, it is suggested that a newly introduced article stating that, with regard to all subjects affecting the sharia, the al-Azhar university should be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its burst radiates all over the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative machinery, which would in fact result in the judicial supervision of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are to be interpreted.
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Moubarak's reign, the courts were working to punish the opponents.
Up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military after the dictator fell.
The state must also, we can read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be a matter of censorship.
Furthermore, no articles expressly guarantee equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what is an offense or how it must be punished.
Also doubtful is the wording which implies that it is prohibited to "offensive people".
Is it possible to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore a matter of interpretation in Morsi's voting project, which, in his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution reinvigorated"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to drop the sharia before it enters into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we are going to win", Hamdin Sabbahi launches, third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former Chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is "to be cast into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet expired," said Egyptian media reports Khaled Ali, a political man and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square by measure of caution, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and the Salafists' supporters, who participated in it in large numbers, were scanning: "the people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, asserting that "the Koran [was their] Constitution".
A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where everything began, would soon have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had expressed themselves loudly and loudly.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the polls of the country's leadership.
The Islamists project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have extended until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the courts in Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their conceptions of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are insidious violations of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto alienates all of his powers," Saeda laments.
Yet democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could be paid.
A protestant on place Tharir warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
The rakfisk of Norway: is it the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway benefit from one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely smelling fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most expensive dishes.
I'm in the little town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salty salted trout fermented and fermented in water for a period of time - according to the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles and becomes cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this amazing culinary speciality.
"You eat raw, then you have a glass of water," says Harvard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people like small pieces of fish and get a lot of drinks.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," added Harvard.
Drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in water-tight barrels in the air, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians had been forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigranting to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a full health system.
The Swedish, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered as something important, a vital, yet adorant, element of the past of Norway.
It's part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small beer pint or a sandwich will cost you € 10 each.
Norway does not often speak of it in international news, which is not to displease it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they talk about "the July 22 incident."
The Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their peaceful countries, one of them could commit such a barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," says Anna, our waitress, with the blonde hair and the eyes of a blue transcending, the image of northern well-being, with a rakfisk plateau in her hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries were throwing money through the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway managed to keep the cords of its tight stock exchange.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Don't forget the rakfisk," she adds in an unquenchable laugh.
I stand in the snow and tail to buy me something to eat - I had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of propellers, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where rakfisk is used for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a paper knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It would be believed in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give the best fish in Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"I see the dots, Harvard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of water.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult start.
As President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take up his duties in Mexico, BBC Will Grant is interested in the challenges that await him and the people's expectations, which are numerous.
The road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at present.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal time, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, with the results it owes to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is facing a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to the American President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A highly populated and tentacular state that closes the capital. On its predilection land, opinions concerning this new leader are divided.
A Direct Man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises assign it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of Mr. Pena Nieto's new highways, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once wooded and full of cracks.
Plates bearing its name are attached outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to put in place lasting changes," said his political friend and ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and the party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economics, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years of failing power, the PRI was disbanded in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations in the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
It rejects the criticisms of the opponents who blame the new president for lack of charism.
He is an entire man, very engaged, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's an excellent state man and, above all, he can listen.
However, it is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military were called upon to rescue the drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on the side of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Detractors from Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to identify the problem of killings perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse their administration of refusing to see reality in front of them.
In a concrete house, typical of this degraded neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed away," says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the body stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana clothes the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me as if I was an old fellow, a troublemaker, a whistling woman.
They want us to accept what they're saying and to shut up.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, he will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new President has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as president as governor," Olvera said in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning would have been victimized during detention.
The trial deals with Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case because Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate, Friday, that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being the cause of the greatest leak of confidential information from the entire history of the U.S. military -- lacked many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims he suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The counter-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request requiring that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning showed his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked questions in Manning and gave their answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment he had reserved for his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints for ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but did not notice the problems raised.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), and yet that did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a meeting in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for risk of suicide -- for his protection and for the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted to have this status withdrawn... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had planned to kill himself when he was in Kuwait and had disappeared once because of the heat.
He added that not knowing what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, as sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the regulations.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he came back at night, they would wake him up so he could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stay naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning, during the call.
Manning testified that at no time was allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions, on Friday, Manning stated that he had deduced from his guard's order that he should have let go of his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to let her go.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elasticity of his slip or his tongs to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his barrels, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be found guilty before a court of martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defence stated that Manning plans to plead guilty of the least serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend with prosecutors who should argue that conditions of detention are warranted.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public goods or documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to illegal publication of Internet information, and the transmission of national defence information.
If all charges are held, he is incuring the life-threatening criminal detention.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says Mexico-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, when I arrived in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for the "External" ("Foreigners").
I remained motionless for a few seconds, not knowing to which row I was headed.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called the Mexican all my life.
This is an ethnic qualification, as my friends in Boston use when they say "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became Mexican-American.
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that saw my grandfather born, no need for special qualifications or union skills.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, enough to manage an interview in one or the other language.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and headed for the "Foreigners" line.
I thought about that moment of the week when the new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their priority themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans remain in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for trade on the European Union model, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give half of their territory in writing at the end of the gun.
But for the Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and no minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that of the country with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want us to address the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason why the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark, poorly educated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
We also know that part of the Mexican elite in the ruling class does not love us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and we are as if we were people of lower strain and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our links with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed while living in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico-Americans, because Mexicans are more strongly demanding their identity and Mexico-Americans are upset.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she's a part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexican-Americans I know have no impression of being part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we're considered Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico-Americans to work as wealth ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country that must absolutely visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen links with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the inequalities in wages, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, fellas.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico-Americans still wish them the way in which their family members have been treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Quartz, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel-Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has taken off in bursts, and whether or not it is desired, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet, there is every reason to think that it could help them to get out of this deadly impasse.
A War That Makes No Loss or No Winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to demonstrate optimism.
Although the ceasefire on November 21 remains, this week's fights have strengthened the supporters of force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will insist on forcing Israelis to leave, even if Gaza has wiped out a ravine.
Having killed some of its leaders and refouled the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas gains land on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Arab world's Islamists is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, an increasing regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken action and cause for Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members retire and say that the growing Islamist is bent around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its rule, passing through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and even Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily handed over to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the inverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was given a box.
The Iron Dome-Baptized Missile Interception System has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both their ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the cause of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets in Gaza since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, including by the barrier of separation that interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects the Jewish colonies that continue to expand despite their illegal international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud merged with an even more belligerent party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman on the approach to the election of January 22, has the beautiful part.
Why do you pamper these Palestinian craps by giving them a status?
If they were leading the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as they come out of their heads.
Perhaps the supporters of the line will take it; but it may be that the Arab spring changes the giving.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to tackle problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to build their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire what's a good wish -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dust that is destined to explode one day in Israel's occupied territories - a little like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
Repression has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The response remains that of the reasonable people on either side, and most of the outside world and through this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now strive to put an end to the movement of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchange and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal for a pseudo-state to the United Nations.
Mr Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back to the White House, it seems just as reluctant to establish one.
It's a very harsh vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is the result of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for Neutral Cigarette Packs came into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of brand name
This law entered into force in Australia is a world-first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark green olive tree and horrible pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the different health photos and warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter young people from smoking by suppressing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% chances that they will never start.
"Even when children are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Pibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia records the lowest smoking rate in the world and although these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries consider a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers stated that this would revive the trade in the black market, which would make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"Bad consequences will arise from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco Australia.
China and Indonesia will sell many more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others stated that this law had stimulated their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarette cases, especially in silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has greatly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in the high court of Australia.
Ha said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, things are good.
The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population divide targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning advertising on TV, sports sponsorship and the obligation for dealers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and only have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the perfect place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from certain Lambda citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Do we have to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has given himself the trouble of making a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulations in force rather than on marketing.
The industry went to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new judicial decisions - these countries told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013.
Pibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make the warning photos on packaging mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now available in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you rank the package," said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a package on which is a photo of mouth tumor.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna stop is my little girl.
James Yu, managing the "King of the Pack of Tobaccolist" in downtown Sydney, said uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on shelves.
"Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government had only banned them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's good, we stop and we put the key under the door," he added, lifting his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
As a result, I have had enough time to reflect on the issue of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spend a half-day in an airport waiting for a flight is boring enough, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specializing in the development of the child praise the boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
It forces the brain to borrow interesting ways, or even to feed creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the nuisance with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The trouble goes a long way," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evokes the annoyance, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, has been defined and discussed in a number of ways.
After visiting a number of publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined boredom as an experience that consists "to want to do something, but not succeed in engaging in a satisfying activity."
What distinguishes the boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though she would like it.
With apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the trouble, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a blundering mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
The disorder can be very much like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or from the world, while depressed people think that the problem is from them.
Sometimes we may think that we're upset when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Un committed Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, coming from the room next door, the over-high sound of a TV show that had no reports, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said that they were more bored than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or relevant task, a halt can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "how to look at objects on an assembly chain, music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he says now, we know that when torturing or griffing, these gestures, often regarded as signs of annoyance, are actually a good way to stay more alert physically.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigot learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Schedule of Predisposition to Misery" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repeative and monotonous", and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are soon blasphemous.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents reported being bored at school and during homework at home, while 23 per cent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentages of today's trouble, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a period when trouble reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: Is the trouble good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can lead people to take absurd physical risks, betting or abusing certain substances to spend time, as the studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers refer to a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The trouble is the way the brain found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn to take care of himself or self-governing, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from situation to situation," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the trouble.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feel comfortable outside of the constant heating that generates activities and technology is the goal we should aim at.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens a strong and frenzied desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way of disconnecting and valuing stopping times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directives for the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and football player in Colorado, is charged for something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and a few friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his use - minor offences, each with a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been ranked without further delay.
Police have ceased to charge adults 21 years of age and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of commercial sales of marijuana approved by the state in their neighbourhoods.
"Things evolve so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of the Aurora police, east of Denver.
The regulatory bodies of the state of Washington are also asking questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is desired or not, is in advance of most marijuana regulation states, first of all regarding use for therapeutic purposes and now with regard to personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and it is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, acknowledges Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
The Washington Law, which is called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a legal void of a year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical questions remain outstanding: how to balance the state's mandate that ensures adequate access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales within a radius of 30 km around a school, park, playground or creek.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install a licensed cannabis trade, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Centre for the Legalization of Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer continue the 21-year-olds with small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should cease to charge people for this "immediate effect" crime.
Chief Oates stated that the police would apply the new judicial decisions that regulate the activities of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the "circuit attorney" (Procurator of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a more strict vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly in order to pressure users to become detoxified.
At present, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many are charged with other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed a crime who, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer appear as adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the County Public Prosecutor's Office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to rank immediately all cases of marijuana detention.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time keeping applying the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado's voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials in relation to the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents people accused of marijuana consumption and speaks as a local spokesperson for the "National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws".
"They have spent much of their lives prosecuting people who consumed marijuana, too, have difficulty accepting it as legal," he said.
As the first states to treat the restricted consumption of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs.
While state defenders and representatives anticipate a new legalized sales border, they look forward to the federal government's guidelines, which always perceive the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will pass away.
Despite some mediatized arrests of therapeutic marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana to sell for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police will probably not break down the doors to seize small drug bags, there is strong reason to believe that they are opposed to authorized commercial sales of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even though it was only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and it is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we are faced with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the community's vote rather than in the state's vote.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was ill-treated and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me a prominent place of knowledge, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I settled in Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The newspaper of L'Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that students in the first cycle had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson pointed out that I was part after being forced to drink in a cup.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been bullied and constantly bullied.
Not because of my rather ominous name, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for only one reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisoree of Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why would you mention this today? You'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of middle-right students undergo the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the student room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College said that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want to have a representative in the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary released on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The country of Wonders: Young, Intelligent and of Law"), devoted to politics among students, and which portrayed "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
In particular, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves to Rolls-Royce, is a complete silver tree and moves with a chromed head cane.
In other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as scapegoats for the establishment of an increase in tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left party in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "inconfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the UCA, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one thinking of that in my first few weeks of Oxford.
I entered September 1986, at the time I was 18 years of age and was paralyzed with shyness.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
In the previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - an old student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the week, when the new students met with the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen later.
I found that not only did the teachers participate in sarcasms towards Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy regarding the harsh minors, the privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was engraved on the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was victim of was a translation into English of the 18th-century French texts, and I was not prepared there.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a filthy face, took easy.
"Are the Thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French classes during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy to make friends," he launched a horny tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservator) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even harder for you.
Most young Torys claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That stratagem failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have resumed the refrain.
I was pervert, you know.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I only lead a normal life in Oxford?
Were I forced to meet people sharing the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I have become Labour and deny my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy advisor to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never here.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his Marxist-Determinist adherence to history.
In 1997, he accepted a teaching position at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started making a shuttle between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelievable.
During his studies at Oxford, in the forty years, all political viewpoints were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he told me pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dream bells.
Even my Communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Let them have a chance.
I'm sure it's just to trick you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Fatigued by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a session of work conducted the following week, when another history professor suggested the most serious in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Injuring internally of shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and treated them as "crazy old".
The regimen was short-lived.
It was my father who pulled the last nail out of my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch’s press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed carpeted in my room, and after five minutes, my followers left.
When they left, I packed my bag and took the first train for London.
I never came back.
You can treat me like wet chicken.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 First Ministers Tory, but also enjoyed an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian sewing company.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The seamstress recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high-cut models created for his sewing house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his unimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ point of a story whose only protagonist is "Mr. Garavani", but who could not have been written without his famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened until 3 March, there are impressive numbers of private letters and photos signed by the aristocracy cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest sewing machine of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jetset.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette moustaches on your beautiful carpet as some pop music stars do," Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza said.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and received with generosity and elegance.
"We all love being invited to his Gstaad chalet," explains former "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has also forgotten the charism of the tailor.
Several years ago, after a parade on Place d'Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never pass away, for its creations are works of art," she ends.
Noblesis line line parade
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves the tall people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a 60-metre wide glamorous podium that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the seat of the mannequins and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" of dream bearing Valentino's main creations, such as the cutter that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to the emperor Farah Diba.
Among these mannequins are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the tailor in 2006
Many of his clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "not to be forgotten".
I'm perfectly reminded of that.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he had given me," said Naty Abascal, one of the tailor's museums.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he exalts our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they're bright and they light his face.
The ratios are perfect.
The princess and modest Patricia della Giovanpaola of Arenberg cannot, either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red night dress, with a flying skirt, a draped buster and a drop-off.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg retains the sewing evening dresses with "the greatest care, because a night dress is not only a dress, it is also the whole memory of her vehicle."
The "kings" of the mode
The grand final of the exhibition of Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during his wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girlfriends" (the couturator thus calls his sewing machines) to realize this ivory silk dress with incrustations of pearls, twelve different kinds of laces and a four- and a half-metre stretch.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the leading authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high sewing of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obliged for years by the "being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani combines as many honours as any of its customers' spouses.
"I'm refined, calm, and perfect, and I've always jumped into my eyes," acknowledges Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years had no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says so...
The world's hardest profession: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and health by bringing 70 kilos of sulphur through the steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by bringing the sulphur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the earth's guts solidifies to the contact of the air.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which weigh about 70 pounds [70 kg], he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steeped trails.
There are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano that reaches 2,386 meters of altitude, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to scale this distance, at a tortoise allure, by keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their life, as it happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The minors of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once on the top, he wanders a path among tourists who photographed them as if they were circus animals, and carrying the heavy baskets painfully, they walk the 3 kilometers up to the balance that a mining company has set a little down at 1,850 meters altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it at 10,000 rupees (83 cents euros) to the petrochemical industry because this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who generally travels three trips a day.
Everyone takes 3 hours and ends up exhausted, but this allows him to win $138,000 (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such an overhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (EUR 1,20) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (EUR 167)", says the carrier who used to work as a brick on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (€6.20) per day and the job was not so difficult, but then he returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java for conversion to Islam".
Then he suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already started making him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Then he suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to continue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in a more acceptable English language.
Sick of life, this friendly and intelligent young person could be a tour guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he does the work of a mule.
It shares an insalubre wood measurement with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur keeps dripping at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto goes down into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to carriers who work on their behalf and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not touch a sub of the 30,000 rupees (€2.50) increase by camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (€1.20), that the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for the beasts, not for the humans," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left the college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will not stop working "until he can" because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick smoke columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... to which their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, knee pain and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets are obviously added.
By balancing the basket on his back, 53-year-old Unainik can only load 50 kilos.
Each day, his companions and others drew 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carried to the warehouse in Tamensari, 18 kilometres from there by a trail of goats invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the perpetual misery of generation is one of the most difficult occupations in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans place responsibility for this lack of children on career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unfeasible that these words come from ad for mint pills, but despite that, or perhaps because of that, the video spread like a dust trail on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychinelle in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to enable people to fulfill "their national duty".
It is destined only for the Internet, so we have been able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth, so we feel that it was a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes to pheromones or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we said the following: What is more creative to solve this problem than to do a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take that lightly.
It spends US$1,300 per year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, in accordance with its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was over 2, considered the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"It has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the creation of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment within the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that are rarely disguised as xenophobic against new immigrants, especially towards Chinese people who are accused of drawing wages down and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore has experienced its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to address the problem with the establishment of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in birth rates has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government tries to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the "footbox", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the El Developers real estate company, says that its "footboxes" sell much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these housings are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidance to the promoters, who previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city.
If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with the Singaporeans working in the central financial district, it would appear that they do not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, so people give it back later," says a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and my time," says another young man over twenty years.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of access to property and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
Which is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it is about the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is involved in the private sector for under 16 years of age?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to by disseminating events on the Internet that he would certainly not share online?
The ElPeriódic newspaper interviewed five young boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" with personal and "password and username" when applying it to social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private word on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been holding an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everybody," he says.
On FB, I place nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my pictures or someone who would make the fool," he said.
The boy recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine Twitter subscribers.
The majority are family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept an unknown person's request.
He won't trust anyone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 people on his list of friends.
"It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, for example, music," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made any advances or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would just remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we are experiencing today under the name e-mail are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was picked up on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assured.
The victim, according to José, didn't close his account.
"He only put it in private profile."
He then tells us a series of manipulations to set up his account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this young person would post knowledge photos in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I was angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyberharpment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, professor of English and laid off in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a way to look for information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who has a master in teaching at Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they are children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who need to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or told at an age where they do not have the necessary maturity to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective while what they care most about is being popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them reflect.
"Telling them not to do so is no use," she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others are publishing on you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everybody need to know what you're doing at all times?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"At times of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, that must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and education adviser, states that it is essential for parents to read conscientiously the conditions for the use of social networks.
By including each of the terms, they will have a solid basis to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not speak to strangers.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The VIth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) was concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Eff tried several times to access the document signed at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially indicated that it would be disclosed after the conclusion of the summit and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian government website.
When questioned on the text, they indicated that its content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, during brief press statements.
Journalists' access to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, limited audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The limited information circulated among journalists was given by press officers from some of the Governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important information.
Later, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech rather than the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru had been host to the 3rd Arab South America Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was requested by the press, it had also not issued the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which splits a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and declared that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleadings of both parties in the trial that Lima tried against Santiago and that began Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are bringing before this international court today," said President Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of international disputes, treaties and tribunals," President Piñera added, handing a hand to President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia had this week denounced the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international court, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the proceedings in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 project lines had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that Unasur countries would set up "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of residence permit agreements".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in combating urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for improved accessibility to drugs, low-priced Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphal matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and provide a better future for our people," said President Humala.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were concerned with Peru and were on the cross-cutting axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, stated, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," President Santos said.
"We are going to revise all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will call for a discussion with that country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," President Santos added.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they have planned to attend the taking of power of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, at the summit, the Ministers of the Block Defence will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan that attempts to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru is responsible for the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, had to take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the VIth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on State television, TV Peru, that the Europeans "were engaged in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now that they formed almost a country".
In this regard, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship encouraged by the Unasur member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to have as a part of the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President supported the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, on the other hand, we, the South American, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected".
In addition, he criticises the Swedish justice that demanded that he submit to an interrogation on a alleged sexual offence in his territory while "Swedish law itself allows it to be done by video conference, which could be done since the Ecuador Embassy in London".
Correa claimed that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"This is about anybody's health," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution given to Assange since June at the Equatorian Embassy in London, which would be the award of a except-conduction solution that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and points out that he had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, as Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón has launched a whole series of procedures with different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Great Britain would grant it except driving as soon as tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as it fully permits its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London, or asked him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and he pointed out that what he would not tolerate was "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of the freedom of the press are not malicious or perverse politicians, but bad journalists on the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, it was pleased that this was not the type of journalists "not the banks or the bourgeois and hegemonical countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting its re-election forward, "it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and draw the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should stand firm and not tolerate opportunism and attempts of disguised coup", because in reality, "this would destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Furthermore, the Ecuadorian President considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They must be solved as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the good resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it was "good that Latin America seized international forums if both countries agreed to accept such a firm judgment".
Referring to the possibility of his nomination as candidate for the future presidential elections in Ecuador, he noted that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost primarys in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this possible victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If you ever forgive us, I'll do it, too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just discussed with the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today participated in Lima at the VIth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the test: seropositive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he says, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make it "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to deal with his illness alone and began to inform himself about it and his caress was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit in Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he was found in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic would avoid saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he notes that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of assignment of the immune system presented by patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for CD4 rates of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach a 500 CD4 rate.
To speak simply means that for someone who will receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "as long as he will remain under control, he will be able to live without problems until 75 years of age," explained the scientist interviewed.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it must be known that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the emergence of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national basis have died.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years, we have never missed medication, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or then they learn about it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on global mortality, it is to perform more early diagnoses and, for this, it is necessary to offer testing in a massive way, to all those who ask for it."
Specialists and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who have had to do their screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and, despite his age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better that I burst three times a week," they say, that's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I practice, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active, but co-responsible sexual life, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of World AIDS Day.
If they do the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV positive and better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are numerous gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, supported Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "there has indeed been an increase in the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of one hundred, it is very good, but as a result, today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do about it?", posed with sarcasm and valuable judgment by social workers, guidance advisers, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, assures the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms be not only sold to counters, but that they be found in public toilet distributors and in places that young people frequent.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had responded when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, it is best to provide condoms to already sexually active people," he said.
Figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in many of the new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of contamination occurs by sexual means, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal means.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore HIV.
A decision ratified on appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario gives rise to a harmful precedent for all national companies with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It would therefore appear that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country on the starboard, at the expense of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the coup brought to the trial on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's main glass manufacturer to enter the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the case judge points out that creditors are required to register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Tribunal, which is based on New Orleans, states that the main proceedings is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for Uniform Commercial Law International had been created to this end by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-corporate vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the Vitro case is not the first to use this plan.
Here are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Failures had secured debts.
Furthermore, it is certain that, since the voting of the subsidiaries remained, in any way the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the U.S. courts, i.e. the "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
Data omitted from the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he faced since 2008 without ending the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, affecting the country's costs.
For now, the company of the family González Sada will appeal to the same appeal court for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
In this case, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States will demand non-property and require the review of the trial by a higher court.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the curiae amicus ("friend of the Court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro was detailed under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that this would release it from the conventions signed by both countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
He also pointed out that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carnation of two parts: they absorb Vitro and they absorb the country.
General balance sheet
The claims of the Mexican Aviation Society's trade unions against the company's former patron Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were silenced for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviadores has already encountered problems.
The proceeding, by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values that is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has consistently denied providing information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw F/589 trust from Bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares from the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're sitting on the Dragon Mars.
Meetings at the end of the week in an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society have approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mars in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the great wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-Eastern zone in order to oppose the monumental project that lies in part on protected areas and represents the largest of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead.
The government put forward a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Anti-Control Agreement, known under her English acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was good that the senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was regarded as an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basket-ball is my life"
"Hetin" Reyes' basketball trotter has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the land and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage did not condemn him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, a national basketball team player, the national team manager and leader, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I carried several helmets in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the National Team, Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls during a visit of First Hour to him in Bayamón, where he has been living with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basket-ball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs that remind him of his itinerary out of order, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves most are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vacaros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"This has been my best years, the ones I've enjoyed most because I've had the chance to take part in eight cowboy championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
Then I retired at the 1981 championship, the year that Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great manager, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been the leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a hard player for you, it measures two meters.
You want it?"
That's how to start Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse was going to help us try to win another one.
He welcomed the Vaqueros Championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of Mincy's duties and those on the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't let us play the last game, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and put a rattle on the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze in the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world's 90s because of a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but she gave us a gold medal and great joy at the Neuquén Pre-Olympic tournament in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Snows, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Without a doubt, this is Piculin Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has ruled at this level as Piculin did.
And that does not take into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very difficult to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work Leo Arell does a lot.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that, in the early 1990s, the National Team had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I wish I could have put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I have seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, take advantage of my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I take advantage of the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman's dead
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became known worldwide for the main role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a man of business without scrupulously, fearless and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as an unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday night of cancer complications, according to a family release sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, again playing the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her press release, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the full," Gray said in a communiqué.
The doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992, and he had recognized many years of drinking.
In 1995, he had been detected with a malignant liver tumor and had had a graft.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television as an ordinary guy in the "Jinny series of my dreams" broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In this one, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedies that remained short on the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema are well-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterly interpretation of the deliciously disgusting J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and its relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculations worldwide and millions of dollars played in betting.
As a result, among other things, the series reached a record of hearing at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was the sister of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened her with prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reason to attack her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and unsatisfied man but with charismatic smile: a dishonest contractor and an unfaithful husband who was trying to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is the honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, a co-protagonist of the original series, recalled Hagman's Friday as a "great man, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each one of us, who had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is in progress, informed the chain.
For now, neither Warner nor TNT channel have communicated how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who is famous for classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her the day in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the scenes of New York Theatres in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (French: Hello Darlin': The Unpleasable Memories of J.R.)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver graft, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I restore their trust, I come with them when they come to operate and after," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to give them some comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's going to be okay."
He was also a tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A treatative course of the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This semester, when Professor of Religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hammock: the end of the "great count" of the Mayan calendar on 21 December, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea of what awaited him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax wretch that some called "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of time thought would trigger the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé this week to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we looked at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were talking about it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is evil is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last of history.
In the Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker delivered the course "Media, Culture and End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas flourish over time," he said, and the way they provide hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human conduct.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students need to study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the night of the end of the supposed world," Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, from the University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a question of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursery, says he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less than one professor, told us to believe on the end of the 21st December.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy, and in some way we discredited it," says Julie Zegle, a senior student in the Temple, aged 21 and from West Chester.
The Maya have never predicted the end of the world, this is only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I agree that there is an anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, answered quickly when he was asked whether he knew that there were courses on "the end of the world."
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception coming from a superior authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, we have talked about the many alleged dates of last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start to think immediately on the next date" or to philosopher on the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us that they thought they were going to parties "of the end of the world."
"Sometimes I call friends and we're in a fight together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
