Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronary artery disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
According to the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care services should prepare themselves for a peak of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a home of unknown etiology pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronovirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a benign condition, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In approximately 14% of the cases, COVID-19 causes more severe damage requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a serious form of disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the cumulative impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom (U.S.), and compare it with the developments in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of VOCID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 edition of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to WHO's case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (U.S.) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Acquiring cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPCM), the number of cases of VOCID-19 reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities in different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 0800.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare with the experience of Italy.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020 at 8.00 p.m. with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom generally followed that in the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom reported a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom compared to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that, by 15 March at 8.00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 increases rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progresses at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in national public health services responses, potential variations in case definitions, as well as differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catching tests.
As of March 2020, physicians in affected regions in Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not submitted).
However, systematic collection is necessary to complement current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care for 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios related to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalised CVID-19 cases associated with a risk > 90% of excess capacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of ECCM on CVID-19.
Given that the cases have so far been grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and that hospitals and intensive care services generally receive a defined regional population, data on cases and beds in intensive care should, preferably, be set at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care, as well as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of the ECPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, by moving from an approach to a mitigation approach, to the extent that the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window in which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Without that, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the days or weeks to come.
The epidemic of coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by corronovirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people infected in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
As its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, VOCID-19 presents less severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this subject of growing research.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still await answers, we hope that this review will be involved in better understanding and eradicating this serious illness.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, has forever marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain closed for the duration of the golden week as well as for other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that causes an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAs) in 2003; that is why it was baptized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease called coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan and spread rapidly to all of China before extending to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of CVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "the public enemy number one," potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works have been published on VOCID-19, including in virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 with a virus sequence isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this new subject in progress.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronovirus disease, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and we will address some still outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronoviruses are traditionally considered non-mortal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common rums 4.
However, during this century, we experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before rapidly spreading to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third coronovirus epidemic in recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1.1, pneumonia homes of unknown origin were first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronovirus sequence was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic had spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point of the infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO qualified the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of writing this report, the disease had already spread to all of China as well as to almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig. 2).
To the extent that the situation is rapidly changing, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COPID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qH2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
About half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50 years of age, very little less than 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
VOCID-19 developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and on the outskirts.
The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of VOCID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-72).
The average duration between symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincided with the massive displacements that took place prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
The coronavirus is a subfamily of large viruses wrapped with a simple blond RNA.
They can be classified into four genres: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect the human belonging to the alpha and beta genres.
The envelope's Spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme and dipeptideyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-ronavirus, with more than 99.98% of genetic identity between 10 sequenced samples taken from the outbreak site, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using electronic transmission microscopes, particles of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in ultra-fine sections of human epithelium of the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a lower infection than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein coded by the orf3b as well as a secret protein coded by the orf8.
The ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the ORF8 does not contain known functional areas or motifs.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of the complete human ACE2 to a resolution of 2.9 and in complex with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, which provided indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate the infection with SARS-CoV-2.
The host of origin and the host of origin
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from bats and were transmitted to Man via the civets and the camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats-suris were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the barrier of species to infect the human remains unknown, and the transmission route is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., made the assumption that the virus could have been transmitted bats to humans by snakes, which would imply a homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers from Guangzhou, China, the pangolin - a long-range ant feeding mammal, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by 99% genetic homology between a kronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % gap between two genomes is a difference of importance and therefore it is necessary to expect conclusive results to establish concrete evidence (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
The SARS-CoV-2 may very well have similar properties.
It would appear that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally free of immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by its immune system by means of molecular motif recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
By different channels, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including T-cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronovirus can inhibit T-cell functions by inducing their apoptosis.
Humorous immunity, with complements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive immune system reaction causes localized explosions in the number of free radicals, which can result in severe lung injuries as well as other organs and, in the worst scenario, multi-visceral failure or even death.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by home appearance, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally than 3 to 7 days after a study of the first 425 cases reported to Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days for a range ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded at an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) after a demography of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective duration of quarantine after as specific incubation as possible, in order to avoid the transmission of the virus by infected but asymptomatic individuals.
Usually, people exposed to or infected with the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of VOCID-19, and may be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the disease occurred.
With regard to severe cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as patients with acute fever, even in the absence of thoracic radiography abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow an early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported by two recent studies on a family and home that have been reported following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with higher lethality of the MERS compared to the COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with SERS.
Regarding SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%), and ventilatory assistance was needed for approximately 14-20% of patients.
On 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2%, for 66,576 worldwide confirmed cases.
Comparably, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10 per cent for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) at 95% of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only from 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to propagate than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but that it is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than it was for the epidemics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without having symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients restored may again be carriers of the virus, which emphasizes the need to increase the quarantine duration.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L and a high rate of aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had high levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the D-dimère rate, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes decreased gradually.
thoracic X-ray abnormalities are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral uneven shadows or a powdered glass opacity at the lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of liquid and progressive fibrosis seriously impair the gas trade.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in the surfactant rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying thoracic examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocytes dequamation, the formation of hyalin membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a deceased patient of the disease, which coincides with viral infection pathology and SDRA and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The SARS-CoV-2 ARN detection via a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as a primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which identifies synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive tape within one hour without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if it is used on clinical specimens.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support to patients with COVID-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, restore patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients has been proposed for treatment purposes.
All pharmaceutical companies are working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be given extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (CMO), a modified cardiopulmonary derivation technique used for the treatment of critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune system reaction has been found to cause cytokinic shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN in IFN, and MPP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ADDS and multi-visceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially for serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shocks include modulation of the T-cell immune response, blocking of cytokines IFN-', IL-1's and TNF's, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab's, cytokines 4' signaling suppressant, and ADAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroids did not have a beneficial effect on severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would result in serious side effects, including a vasculary osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, careful use of low to moderate-dose corticosteroid short cycles has been recommended for patients with severe VOCID-19.
At the time of writing this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, proved effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medication originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, redesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-line RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead sent the compound to China to enable a number of tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury and other side effects may occur following combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma restored patients and antibody production
Collecting blood in patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from it is an ancestral practice.
Indeed, restored patients often have a relatively high rate of antibodies to the pathogen.
The antibodies are a immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
In this way, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who cured COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms have improved in 24 hours, in combination with a decrease in inflammation, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are required to be able to propose this method for large-scale use until any specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some of the drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can lead to excessive stimulation of the immune response and lead to cytokines release syndrome, potentially fatal.
The level of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells from restored patients and to identify genetic codes coding relevant antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would make it possible to rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain little or no known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the absence of a specific effective treatment of COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease remission symptoms.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proven to be effective for the treatment of VOCID-19.
The highest cure rates of COVID-19 were observed in provinces of China using TCM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7%), Ningxia Region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which had only used up to 30% of patients with COVID-19, has the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison as many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be taken into account for the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his staff published a study comparing a treatment using Western Medicine (MO) only and a combined treatment involving MO and MTC.
It was found that the return time to normal body temperature, the withdrawal time of symptoms and the length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (light to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% to 46.2%); likewise, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM remains to be clarified through more-scale controlled trials and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are generally very concerned about this highly contagious and fatal disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric disorders have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact research and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt of the patients regarding the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to patients with VOCID-19, to individuals identified as likely cases, to people in contact with these populations, and to any other person in distress.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the transmission chain of animal and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Attenuated live vaccines were assessed on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these potential vaccines in the elderly and on models subject to lethal provocation and their protection against an infection with a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, cases and sporadic homes of MERS continue to be reported in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for the MERS with the help of inactive virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the important period (18 months on average) needed to develop a dynamic coronary artery vaccine and variations.
To the extent that this is an emerging disease, the VOCID-19 starts its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a model of prediction is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies to date, factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with VOCID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SARS prognosis, and this also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
VOCID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65, with 47.7% more than 50 years of age according to a study conducted on 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (mean age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with VOCID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with positive cholangiocytes of ACE2, which may result in hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it has been advanced as a potential predictor of disease, treatment response and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity as well as the COVID-19 prognosis was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of dehydrogenase lactate (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also be involved in establishing the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, especially at the heart and liver level, and are released in case of tissue lesions.
Therefore, they traditionally constitute markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: thoracic X-ray results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in addition treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose corticosteroids were widely used in severe cases of SARS, many survivors experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: as described above, the VOCID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, patients often suffering from long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty as well as the death of close or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support in order to help these individuals overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause or induce symptoms in the first phase of the infection, like coronaviruses at the origin of common colds.
As a result, newly infected or incubated individuals can produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly hinders the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by seriously ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current epidemic of COVID-19 is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than that of SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continuing quarantine of almost all the population with a view to interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as on other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the phase of decline will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., considers that the COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than the SARS, will not go out by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the removals of the average nasal cornet and the throat of restored patients, 2 weeks after their exit from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual decline of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the original estimates, the Ebola virus was expected to result in up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infection to eventually extinguish itself or that it evolves into a less pathogenic virus that coexists with Man.
A comparison of the COPID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough or sneezes, and also possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in saddles, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients revealed that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, precautionary measures should be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even anyone who might be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respirator masks N95 (1860) participates in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposit on surfaces, where they could be passed on to others.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of virions of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions capable of entering completely; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the size of SARS-CoV, since both measure approximately 85 nm.
Since particles manage to cross five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients carry N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals need to wear adjusted isolation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor found that he had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus might have entered his body by the eye because of inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals must also wear transparent visas or protective glasses to contact patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfecting soap more often than usual, to stay confined to maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one metre with the sick.
These measures are effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new human virus, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in high alert status after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Centre reassured the population by claiming that the new virus was not contagious, that it presented limited interhuman communicable status and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable release, especially at the time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn from them and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) demonstrate greater sensitivity and responsiveness to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginning rather than to try to reassure the population; and (4) perform more targeted and relevant exercises to raise awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and improve the society's response system on a regular basis.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it has spread to all of China as well as to almost 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the epidemic of COVID-19 is born as an impression of already vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
VOCID-19 affects older people more than young people and more than men than women; severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
The transmission of the VOCID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by seriously ill patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of VOCID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection tests may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, restored patients may again be positive to the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of propagation.
Despite rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology was established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to confirm that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiroptera.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the original host virus, for example bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt the transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to the ACE2, but how does the virus enter exactly into the respiratory cells, and how does it result in pathological changes?
Is the virus also related to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface as flu?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to get answers to all these questions as well as many others.
However, regardless of the expenses that this must lead to, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunodepressed patients have experienced severe respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong province in China.
Apart from the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could generate approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period between 4 and 7 days, the peak viral load occurring on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false liver function tests and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in case of suspected SARS.
Common alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract, several organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which can be fatal especially in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to research on HCV.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunodepressed patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of this virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old male with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he was identified in the Netherlands, he is actually present worldwide.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laryngitis, also known as a crop.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old hospitalized man due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MRS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by an acutely evolving pneumonia.
Contrary to SARS, many patients suffering from MRS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MRS in relation to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases in laboratories have been reported with a high death rate, 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most known human viruses.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 were reported and could contribute to its rapid spread in the world.
Comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCOV revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the six other HCOVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCOVs (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of CVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in saddle samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, its pathogenicity and its sustainable distribution after transmission to humans, will have an influence on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCOVs that cause moderate symptoms have adapted well to man.
In other words, both could be the survivors of the previous HCOV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans to a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate the host's restriction factors.
In this perspective, the more the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 persists and the more people infected are important, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by 40 or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired COVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple rhyme in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require animal reservoirs.
On the other hand, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and propagate in their zoonotic tanks and seek an opportunity to achieve potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 presents similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCVs acquired in community.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired and less pathogenic HCOV than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without a tank or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it will be helpful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolving, natural hosts, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCoV.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of a HCoV if it shelters a nearby ascendant sharing a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The virus of origin has often been well adapted and is not pathogenic to its host.
In the same way, a tank host houses HCoV in a continuous and long-term manner.
On the other hand, HCOVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural tank host.
In particular, since 80% of Guangzhou market animals have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also serve as host amplifier intermediates cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive to the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the basis for a new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is known as the receptor of SARS-CoV.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate host of SARS-CoV.
That is why bats cannot be the intermediate container host of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that the dromadares were seropositive to specific antibodies neutralizing MERS-CoV, as well as camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the feces, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animals hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less important than that between the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoVs.
Scientists remain divided into the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could both be derived from the bat coV, while the parent viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed the barrier of species to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCO-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the bat near the HCOV-229E were found.
First, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpagas.
Thereafter, the alpaga-Alpha-CoV-Bowl related to HCoV-229E are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpaga-Bowl-Bowl has caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaga alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogen viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCO-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while bat-chau-suri alpha-CoVs serve as a genetic reservoir of HCOV-229E, alpagas and dromadaria could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-COV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission of bats to human dromadares and dromadares.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known by its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in the dromadaria for decades.
It has been well adapted to these chameleons that have moved from intermediate host to stable natural reservoirs.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of gangs in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-coVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several inter-species transmission possibilities of the SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats by cutting or coal mines.
Second, the pangolins could be one of the host intermediate amplifiers to which a SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by cutting and consuming game meat.
Many mammals including domestic animals may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place within a third species having been in contact with bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-line RNA viruses, estimated VOC mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the adjustment phase of VOC to new hosts.
However, the rate of mutation of the CoVs is approximately one million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It can be assumed that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well suited to drones.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, VOCs change randomly and frequently as a model when replication of the RNA through a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence was found for both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as for animal coVs, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Host-virus interaction related to transmission
Beyond these three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryoscopy study indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times higher than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Foreignly, HCOV-NL63 also binds to the ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and sialic acid 9-O-acetyl for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and host natural reservoirs of HCVs, such as bats, dromadaries and rodents, could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCoVs: return to check-out
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many emerging opportunities for new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among the adjunct proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, since the serum-chavous viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but codified divergent ORF8 proteins.
This deletion splits the ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is felt to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the change of host.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic of MERS-CoV has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which have occurred in the dromadariums in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCO-229E, alpaga's alpha-CoV has a simple insertion of nucleotide, generating a gap in the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by selective pressure exerted in their host tanks.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected by coV, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
The bats seemed to have adapted well to the Anatomical and Physiological VOCs.
For example, anomalies in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoV.
In addition, the high level of reactive derivatives of oxygen (DRO) generated by high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of COV and affect the "reading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogen COV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts to reserve as bats and camels.
They respond strongly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe human infection are found.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions are.
In the case of asymptomatic carriers, however, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of the VOC.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have a beneficial effect on the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation is weak in bats.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with CCM950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat-coV animal sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a bat-coV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Beta-CoV of the significantly similar pangolin to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the beta-CoV of the pangolin could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CoVs returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromadair for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, coupled with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The culture of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance of contagion.
Continued surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from the ecological niches of the natural zoonoses reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe in what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to man, how humans come into contact with bats should be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true middle host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, the SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold can be contracted, for example by omitting to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of handwashing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of infectious causes of diarrhoea; and reduction of respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate during births at home.
In developing countries, respiratory and diarrhoea-related infant mortality rates can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soap handwashing.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which is nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia lead to the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Washing hands also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deletion, frequent handwashing can damage the skin by causing skin desiccation.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive handwashing could lead to eczema or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly frequent among health workers.
Too common handwashing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (TOC).
Deparasition twice a year, associated with daily handwashing with soap and daily toothbrush with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic soils, are hardly soluble in the water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants allows to target organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, although antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the active and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's School of Public Health indicated that common knowledge was as effective as antibacterial knowledge for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and remove hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of warm water did not help to reduce microbial burden on the hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbon dioxide (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or to a wetter such as glycerine in order to obtain liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide reinforces antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their quick elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by skin moisturizers and/or moisturizers.
The effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcohol solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, the disinfectants for the hands are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The efficacy of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands depends heavily on the ingredients and the formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas using benzalkonium chloride have shown a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is mitigated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ashtray or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Furthermore, if the soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it is likely to increase the spread of diseases rather than stop it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with cold or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make any difference).
Swallow a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Fleetter for at least 20 seconds.
The action of friction creates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and to rub more germs.
Rinse enough into the running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant watershed can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or free air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily recommendated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and enamelled nail polish can host microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes skin damage that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economic alternatives to hand-washing when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, water flow from a suspended or perched gourd and/or use as needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as typpie-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging hook using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand-drying is an essential part of the hand-drying process, but the best way of hand-drying in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers often found in toilets.
After the washing and drying of hands in warm air-drying, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased on average 194% on the thumb pulp and 254% on the palms.
Dry-drying in jettisoning resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand drying, the following changes in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different handdry manufacturers, and the handdryers were compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical washing of hands must last for at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to bite and rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by walking between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The goal of handwashing in health structures is to remove pathogens ("growls") and avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewels must be removed.
Under this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should be prevented from flowing up to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained at the first 20% of washing, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
More research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash your hands near private or public toilets, despite economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than to lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can switch from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene campaigns that are carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
The World Day of Handwashing is another example of an awareness campaign that claims to promote behavioural development.Following the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji depicting handwashing.
However, one magazine suggests that the promotion of soap-washing is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmes.
For example, in Germany, posters showing "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and toilets in office and airport buildings.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash their hands before and after every meal.

Because it's the flu season.
It should also be pointed out that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in the genomes of viruses, which are most likely to follow the pressures exerted during the selection, particularly by the host's immune system.
The complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain can be cited as an example, due to a delegation of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCO-229E, alpaga's alpha-CoV has a simple insertion of nucleotide, generating a gap in the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by selective pressure exerted in their host tanks.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected by coV, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
The bats seemed to have adapted well to the Anatomical and Physiological VOCs.
For example, anomalies in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural kill cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural kill cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive derivatives of oxygen (DRO) generated by high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of COV and affect the "reading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogen COV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts to reserve as bats and camels.
They respond strongly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe human infection are found.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions are.
In the case of asymptomatic carriers, however, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of the VOC.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have a beneficial effect on the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation is weak in bats.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with CCM950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat-coV animal sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a bat-coV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals present on the markets were discovered as carrying viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 was identified.
Beta-CoV of the significantly similar pangolin to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the beta-CoV of the pangolin could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
The CoVs returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of VOCs in bats and other animals has strongly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of VOCs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from bat and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is derived from contact between humans and on-the-spot strains, closing of fresh product markets and slaughtering of on-the-sheeps would have been able to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, the pangolins should be removed from the markets of fresh products to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, taking into account the discovery of many narrowly related lines of beta-CoV of pangolins associated with SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the studies that will follow.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromadair for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, coupled with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
Opportunities are not lacking for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombinate, causing the emergence of new more communicable and/or mortal coVs in humans in the future.
The culture of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan of preparation and intervention should be put in place.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance of contagion.
Although bats have many characteristics conducive to the spread of viruses, the likelihood for humans to be in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are aware of the need to stay away from them.
Continued surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from the ecological niches of the natural zoonoses reservoirs.
All the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe in what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to man, how humans come into contact with bats should be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true middle host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, the SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will elucidate the evolving trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of VOCID-19 in humans.
An update of the criteria for diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronovirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to fight this pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspect case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 (seventh version) diagnostic and treatment directives published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
She has been paying a lot of attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are gradually progressing on the basis of the results of the ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have been published in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially modified.
Our directive received a comment from Zhou et al., the latter presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided further evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We support their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest ICVOID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (test seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspicious case must associate one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to form a complete analysis, or correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a travel or residence history in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a contact history with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a contact history with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or nearby areas or other communities where cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) an contact history with a confirmed cluster of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in a reduced area such as home, office, etc.) .
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging showing the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocytes from the beginning of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case shall be based on the suspected case with any following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with known new coronaviruses; (3) positive serum test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody IgG; or modification of the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or increased title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogen testing of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody in confirmed criteria.
Moreover, increasing evidence reminds us of caution regarding atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system must also be checked in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we look forward to the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to pass on their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and comply with the latest directives in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to offer its help.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19-related deaths in one day.
The country records a death record due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladeshi Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (IDRC) reported that the number of registered contaminated persons included 114 active cases and 33 healed persons, who remained confined to home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transportation of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still allowed.
On March 19, these three people had already restored.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeded the million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Around the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, extended the city's confinement until May 1st.
The Portuguese Parliament voted on the extension of the 15-day national state of emergency; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human cronoviruses
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAs) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal HCoV infection could be.
Most HCoVs come from bats where they are not pathogens.
The intermediate reserve hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of host animals has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of the CoV-host interactions in animals could also help to better understand the CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, the VOCs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV).The genus Beta-CoV contains the majority of the VOCs and is divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoV include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracing of the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, motor forces and the restrictive factors of crossing the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the host(s), intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the prevention of future infections.
The CoV animals have been known since the end of the 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was then adapted to grow in pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCO-229E had symptoms of classical cold, including headaches, sneezing, malaise and throat pain, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are both present throughout the world and appear to be mostly broadcast in winter, in temperate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce the limits of toilet paper by purchase
Sunday and Saturday evening Australian Woolworths and Coles store chains have reduced their restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to two and a package per purchase at all stores at the national level, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the caisses and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently collected reservations out of fear of COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to a package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of 8 March, stated that, with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still in storage within the hour after delivery," and qualified the demand for "unprecedented", while AlDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales had a "strong increase" last week, according to a spokesperson from Woolworths.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the quantity allowed to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while AlDI earlier made available stocks for a planned promotion on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers' Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on delivery times by truck make the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers are trying to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are unable to honor the promotion of Wednesday.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a distribution expert at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in stocks of a reduced quantity that, once exhausted, leave large areas empty in rays, strengthening the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [buried] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic," explained Russell Zimmerman at ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were breaking stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper that manufactures Sorbent paper, pointed out that they work 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to the article of News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first buyer at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized because the buyers were on leave during the long weekend of the Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page poster intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, in which they announced that they did not provide for the introduction of purchasing restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also had a high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday night that the UK online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization qualifies the VOCID-19 as a pandemic
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the current epidemic of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2).
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, not to the danger of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to move governments to action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries test, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's Director General.
"We are deeply concerned, not only at alarming levels of propagation and gravity, but also at alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "an unprecedented one".
He stated, in statements published by CNN in February, that "other respiratory viruses, apart from the flu, have not been observed from the onset of the flu until continued worldwide spread."
Gebreysus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
To this he added: "and we have never been witnesses of a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: "To be brief, the situation will get worse."
Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The coronovirus pandemic of 2019-20 is an ongoing coronovirus disease epidemic since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of the coronovirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The lethality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Current symptoms include fever, cough and breathlessness.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include hand-washing, covering the mouth for coughing, staying away from other people, and monitoring and confining suspected people to be infected.
Authorities around the world have reacted by setting up restrictions on travel, quarantine, fire cover, risk controls on workplaces and closures of establishments.
The pandemic has resulted in serious socio-economic disturbances worldwide, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages exacerbated by panic buys.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of Asian origin and appearance in the East and South-East, as well as against other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and closures in the heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a home of cases of unknown cause pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was initiated early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to Huanan's seafood wholesale market and therefore it is believed that the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely related to the coronoviruses of bats, pangolins coronovirus, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was found that the first known person who presented symptoms fell ill on December 1, 2019, and that person did not have a clear link to the subsequent home of the fresh product market.
In the case of the first home reported in December 2019, two-thirds of them were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unaudited report from South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could be reached on November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from the province of Hubei. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases appeared to decrease in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong underestimation of cases, particularly among those with beneficial symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, those 19 years of age and less representing 2.4 per cent of the world's cases. Chief Scientific Adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population should be infected before reaching effective collective immunity.
Cases indicate the number of people tested at COVID-19, and the test was confirmed positive according to official protocols.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had had as their official policies not to test those who presented only benign symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, 86 per cent of undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated in China, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79 per cent of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproductive rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 heal.
For those who do not heal, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to VOCID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths were more than 60 years old, and 75 per cent had pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official counts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who died who were tested positively to COVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, as it might not include untested deceased persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
By-product data from Italy show that the numbers of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of COVID deaths.
A spokesperson of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the sub-evaluation in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza epidemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, out of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica, and several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary depending on the regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global death-case report is 6.0 per cent (9739/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the death-case report decreased by 17.3% (for those at symptoms between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those at symptoms after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the lethality rate (letality rates), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people who succumb to a disease, and the infection rate (infection rates), which represents the percentage of contaminated (diagnosed and non-diagnosed) that succumb to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomised tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of tests on lethality estimates.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the University of Pennsylvania said: "Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then start to recede when the disease has been lacking in available guests.
But it is almost impossible to make current relevant forecasts at the time when this will happen."
Chief Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government Zhong Nanshan stated that "this could be completed by June" if all countries were able to mobilize to follow WHO's recommendations on measures to curb the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine declared that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two".
According to a study by the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is very easily transmitted—was completely gone" and that it could "be transformed into a seasonal disease, capable of re-appearing every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Current symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretions (maucosities), loss of smell, breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six person is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory distress, persistent pain or thoracic pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakening, and face or bluetongue lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent development of the disease may result in severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicaemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms, but with results on the test that confirm the infection, then the researchers issued recommendations that people who had close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
China's asymptomatic ratio assessments vary from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) is between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost the odor was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted primarily in close contact and for the purposes of drops produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have revealed that coughing without protection can project drops at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus could also be transmitted through droplets that would remain in the air over longer periods, which could be projected by speaking. Respiratory drops can also be projected at expiry, especially by speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Posts may land in the mouth or nose of other people located next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and thus lead to air spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted through the saddles, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has excluded the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but spread may be possible before symptoms occur and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive to the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible prior to the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few asymptomatic case reports confirmed in laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if one does not know exactly what ease the disease is spreading, one person generally contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus could be detected at the end of three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, after a day on cardboard, and at the end of four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature; domestic animals and other animals were tested positive at COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, the British authorities recommend washing their hands after they have affected animals, such as having been in contact with other areas that infected people might have affected.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three patients with pulmonary pneumonia related to Wuhan's acute respiratory disease.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think it would be zoonotic.
A genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Beacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (B line) associated with two strains from bats.
It is the same as 96% of the genome of another coronavirus sample of bats (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolin virus and human virus.
The comparison of the whole genome has revealed to date a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between the pangolin coronovirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, the final confirmation is carried out by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanning.
A study comparing the PCR and scanner at Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, though less precise, as many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "the scanner should not be used to detect or as a first-intention test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription of the actual-time polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available in a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a rhinoparynx sampling but also a throat sampling can be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The imaging elements characteristic of radiographs and tomodensitometry (scanner) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral glass opacity and a lack of pleural expansion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to the combination with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed imaging by PCR is limited accuracy to detect COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the thoracic scanner results to the PCR and showed that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, recommending its consideration as a screening tool in the epidemic areas.
Convolutional neurons networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of the virus in the imaging both on radiographs and scanners.
Disease prevention strategies include generally having good personal hygiene, hands washing, avoiding eye, nose or mouth touching with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a trash bag.
It was recommended that those who would have already been infected should wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or advised all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of Community transmission in large areas of the world.
This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. We advise health professionals who care about someone who might be infected to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and wear protective glasses. Contact search is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of telephone localization data by Governments in this regard has raised confidentiality issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communiqué calling for limitations on this type of monitoring.
Several mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record a user's presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive to the COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, to rinse your nose and toss with a mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often in soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having smoked, coughed, or sneezed.
It's because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended that a disinfectant be used for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% of alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of disinfectant exposure to a stainless steel surface), in particular ethanol at 62–71%, isopropanol at 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5%, and iodine povidone at 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glucone, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment as an office building or creek, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by the sick persons are disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with their elbows folded or a handkerchief when they cough or fade, and to throw out every handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the projected posters by speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO issued instructions explaining where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, virologist at Leeds University, "Bringing a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hands hygiene."The use of masks has also been recommended to those who care for a person who is potentially infected with the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they deal with a COVID-19-infected patient, even if it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people not to touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their population to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks in fabric. China specifically recommended the use of medical masks that are disposable to healthy people, especially in the case of proximity (1 metre (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transportation or docks.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make face masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outlets without masks or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone would protect himself and protect others.
The Austrian government ordered anyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which produced ten million masks a day from mid-March, imposed the mask port on long-distance train and bus passengers on April 1.
Panama has made the port of a mask mandatory for all exits, while recommending the manufacture of an artisanal mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes measures to control infections to slow the spread of the disease by decreasing contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Social distancing methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, greeting without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by government and health agencies in the United States was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned more than two public gatherings. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious disease and complications. They were invited by the CDC to stay at home as far as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term "social distancing" with "physical distance" to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by preserving social links, whether virtually or by maintaining a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" meant that a total social isolation should be used, rather than encouraging people to maintain contact with others through other means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or does not present any symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for those diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a COVID-19 disease and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where transmission is very important have been invited to be quarantined for 14 days from the moment they could be exposed for the last time.
Epidemic control strategies are intensification or suppression, and mitigation.
Intensification is introduced during the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made towards the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow it down and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Intensification and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The removal requires more extreme measures, in order to infuriate the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. One part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is trying to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called aplatating the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, masking and quarantine; public social distance measures such as the closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; as well as environmental actions such as surface cleaning; more drastic measures to curb the epidemic have been taken in China as soon as the severity of the outbreak has become apparent, such as the quarantine of whole cities and a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced localized mass screening and quarantine, and issued alerts on the displacement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected persons who have quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not done so.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States have shown that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
The removal may be preferred, but should be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens first), because otherwise the transmission is rapidly rebounded when the measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medicines without an order against the cold or consumption of drinks and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids may aggravate the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of VOCID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" may soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care for the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services for resource redeployment at different levels, including through the use of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, by cancelling non-emergency interventions where possible, separating and insulating patients tested positive to COVID-19, and by strengthening intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories concerning the place of origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could go back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
They are generally related to the Huanan seafood market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. A home of unknown cause pneumonia was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the hospital of the province of Hubei, who informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "SRA-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenenliang, were reprimanded by the police for propagating false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was rebuked by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public opinion on 31 December and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the Wuhan health authorities to initiate an investigation early in January.At the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and a major railway correspondence site.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by showing the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 were healed.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted travel and established border controls.
The national reactions included adjudication measures such as quarantine (also called orders to stay at home, shelter on site or confinement) and fire covers. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are subject to a form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people in the world had a form of confinement, a figure amounting to 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would go back to 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a home of unknown cause pneumonia cases on 26 December, which she informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
The initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
The doctors in Wuhan received a warning to have "propagated rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to indicate the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the greatest quarantine in human history," a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop travel from and to Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
Celebrations of Chinese New Year (January 25th) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China converted 14 other structures to Wuhan, such as conference and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to identify the epidemic of COVID-19, including the issuance of health reports for travellers and the extension of the holidays of Spring.
Universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote working measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
The population displacement control was applied in many cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) were involved in one form or another of movement restrictions.After the outbreak entered the world stage in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country within the preceding five days, in this case via a traveler returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang stated that the spread of cases transmitted within the country was essentially blocked, and that the epidemic was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the start of the confinement. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry for holders of a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specifying when that policy was to end.
People wishing to enter China must thus apply for a visa in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and granted monetary recovery plans to businesses.

The nation's health organization reported a considerable increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement named the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
The Shincheonji faithful who visited Daegu since Wuhan were suspected of having originated the epidemic.
On 22 February, of the 9 336 church members 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest level of warning on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea and 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were put in quarantine after three soldiers were tested positive to the virus.
Air companies' schedules have also been affected and therefore changed. South Korea has introduced what was considered to be the largest and most organized program in the world to test the population with the virus, and to isolate all infected persons as well as follow and quarantine the people who have been in contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via mobile application, virus screening drives delivering the results the next day, and increased test capacity to allow the test of nearly 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's programme is seen as a success in the control of the epidemic, although it has not put forty whole cities in place. South Korean society was initially divided on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's prosecution for the government's poor management of the epidemic or, on the other hand, praising its response.
On 23 March, South Korea experienced the lowest number of daily cases in four weeks.

Interurban travel limitation plans were announced in March, although the dense traffic between cities in anticipation of the New Year Persian Noruz has continued.
The Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became a center for the spread of the virus after China in February.
On the basis of allegations of possible dissimulation of the extent of the epidemic in Iran, more than ten countries had been the origin of their cases in Iran on 28 February, suggesting that the epidemic may have been more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government on that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, while 23 of its 290 members reported positive testing of the virus on 3 March.

The suspension of professional activity and sporting events has already been ordered in these areas."On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities in the country while Italy had 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including the football Series A matches, were to be held in private until April, but on 9 March, all the sport was suspended completely for a minimum month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activity, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies.

A CNN report indicated that the combination between the large elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all people with the virus to date could have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first appeared as one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government imposed no form of social distancing or forty-one mass measure on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its manifest lack of reactivity and vitality in response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, discouraging all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work from home if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and showrooms.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational establishments such as pubs and sports halls should close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of workers' salaries, up to £2,500 per month, to avoid unemployment linked to the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced tougher social distance measures, banning the gathering of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activities to the strictly necessary.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control, the U.S. government's main public health institute, announced that it had developed its own screening kit.
Despite this, the United States has made time to start testing, which has obscured the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were initiated by defective screening kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of approval by the federal government for non-governmental screening kits (universities, companies and hospitals) until the end of February and restrictive criteria to qualify for a test until the beginning of March (order of a required physician later).
On 27 February, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.

Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks; they were thought to come from China, but they actually came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese assistance was welcomed in Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the management and intensification of the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, where the Chinese authorities had been accused of concealment that impeded prevention and induction efforts, and the current crisis in which the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the lunar New Year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban to Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that although it was certainly not a WHO recommendation, it was a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is the most concentrated" and he spoke of a "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, following the confirmation of an interhuman transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic was an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the measure was invoked during the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that the USPPI was due to "the risk of global spread, especially for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "there is no reason why measures should interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparation in low-income countries, calling for the urgent need to support those countries that "do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it is about to appear."
Tedros then stated that we were "as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest or pay more tomorrow." On 11 February, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was named COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the “force of the entire United Nations system into the response”.
A United Nations crisis management team has therefore been activated to coordinate the overall response of the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies can provide expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic."
On 14 February, a WHO-led joint mission team was active in China to deploy international experts and WHO on-site in China to support national management and assess "severity and transmission of disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with major national institutions and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of provincial and county response activities, including in urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronary artery pandemic", saying that although it is too early to speak of pandemics, each country should nevertheless enter "in preparation phase".
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team on-site to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives stated that the global assessment of the threat of coronovirus was from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you need to keep yourself ready," adding that the right response measures could help the world to avoid "the worst."
Ryan then indicated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we absolutely accept that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronovirus epidemic could be described as a pandemic.
The Director-General stated that WHO was "extremely concerned at both alarming levels of propagation and severity as well as at alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced important criticisms of its management of the pandemic, which was deemed inadequate, including due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for each individual's rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone was entitled to relief interventions and that this responsibility was the responsibility of the government.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never serve as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
The experts emphasized that each individual had the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, persons living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are responsible for the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on political responses in the various countries of the world, as well as views and advice.
Between policies for strengthening health systems and the global economy and responses to the effects of confinement and displacement restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge posed by the coronavirus.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British Minister of Cabinet office Michael Gove and the son of Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for managing the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) have been identified for their functions following their management of quarantine in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political leaders to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger compared to the coronovirus epidemic.
Some Chinese leaders, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronovirus epidemic would have begun in Wuhan in favor of conspiracyist theories claiming that COVID-19 would hold its origins from the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump's U.S. administration called the coronavirus "China virus" or "Wuh virus", stating that in China "the censorship has overpowered a virus now become a global pandemic", which was then taxed by some opponents and intended "to divert attention from the inability of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has sought a telegram from the U.S. government setting out the lines of a communication strategy apparently from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows: "Everything comes from China.
We are asked to try to communicate this message in all possible ways, particularly at press conferences and television apparitions." Press bodies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have argued that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda boost to gain worldwide influence.
EU foreign policy leader Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "generosity policy".
Borrell also stated that “China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China also called on the United States to lift their sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending aid to the latter two countries a priori.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma in Cuba were blocked by American sanctions on 3 April.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid from other nations to their own country.
And other mask-related conflicts have also been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticised the lack of solidarity of the European Union vis-à-vis Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "only China had answered bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-placed political source" which indicated that 80 percent of Russian aid was "little or no useful for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a charming "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a medical aid cargo to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov stated that "by offering his assistance to his American colleagues, [Poutine] is based on the principle that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to make the same as necessary."
The extent of NATO's "defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's greatest manoeuvre since the end of the cold war, will be reduced.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, he is jeopardizing not only the lives of the American troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about 20 members of the infected parliament, as well as 15 other former or current political figures.
The President of Iran Hassan spiritually wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, indicating that his country had difficulty in fighting the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets because of the US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic called for the United States to adopt common social policies to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare programme, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election during the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated because of the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambigious and passive quarantine efforts" after the latter announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed two weeks in quarantine on sites designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially divided on the response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's prosecution for the government's poor management of the epidemic or, on the other hand, lauding its reaction. The pandemic has enabled countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to authorize the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree until the new order, to suspend parliament and elections, and to punish anyone who would be accused of misinformation on the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The coronovirus epidemic has been charged with several cases of supply breakdowns, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and interruption of plant and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Products Agency issued warnings on drug shortages and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, leading to shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has been alerted to delays in the shipping of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for individual protective equipment has been multiplied by 100.
This application led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also resulted in delays in the provision of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also resulted in a shortage of individual protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity to the Dalagos to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of children's milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the strong prevalence of COVID-19 cases in North Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products, these two areas were spared from severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural production, North Italy did not see significant declines, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food rays were only temporarily emptied, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government members released pork reserves to provide adequate population subsistence.
Similar laws exist in Italy to ensure that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the world economy were felt in China: according to a media report of 16 March, the Chinese economy was hit very hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.

Central banks react faster than they did at the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and recommendations from Governments against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to a decrease in demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British Flybe regional airline failed.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached an unprecedented level.
Several railway stations and ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving major crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's annual festivities, and private businesses have also shut down independently of their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to New Year's Moon have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the forbidden City of Beijing and the fairs of the traditional temple.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year holidays until 10 February, requiring most workplaces not to reopen before that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and declared an emergency situation, stopping schools until March and canceling its New Year festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in opening hours of stores or temporary closures.

In North America and the Middle East, traders found a 50-60 per cent decrease.
This also resulted in a drop of 33 to 43 per cent of pedestrian traffic in commercial centres in March compared to February.
Operators from commercial centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as the increase in cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of customers and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional persons under extreme poverty in Latin America in relation to a pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, during the peak epidemic in Wuhan, approximately 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the some 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves trapped at home in domestic provinces or stuck in Hubei province. In March 2020, over 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for assistance from the government.
The coronovirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confining in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) to unemployment. The Angus Reid Institute's survey found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced some type of unemployment. Almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement imposed on mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. About half a million German companies had their employees shifted to a government-subsidised partial activity scheme called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The arts sectors of the show and cultural heritage have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations and individuals, both employed and independent, worldwide.
Art and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public and to support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions were closed to new order and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also had an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place the last week of the Christian penance period of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes rather than attend Sunday Mass; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live or television while others propose to practice their worship as a "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome which closed its churches and its chapels and the Saint Peter Square which was emptied of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants at the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most important interruption of the world sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events have either been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, the EUFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The epidemic disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were initially to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but not later than the summer 2021". Casinos and other gaming institutions around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has driven many players to sign up online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of the show has also been affected, with several music groups that have suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many great theatres, such as Broadway, also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have looked for ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet, replacing traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online festivals created to make artists produce, disseminate and promote their works.
On-line, many Internet memes on the theme of coronavirus have spread because many favor humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a rise in prejudices, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were still limited in China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to Chinese people, whether online or offline, and to people living in areas affected by the virus.
As the epidemic progressed to new sensitive countries, the Italians, the first European country to suffer from a severe epidemic of COVID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea first signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChinaDontComeToJapan was furious on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced the criticism for calling the coronavirus a "China virus", a term considered by his detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North East India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The president of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh's Western Bengale Unit said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took his revenge on them."
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which calls them "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were attracted by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign waste" that should be "eliminated".
Many paid-access newspapers have been removed for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the epidemic in free access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of coronovirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detection of the virus and detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronovirus.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too light to be reported or asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect the reported lethality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharyngeal excavation or expectoral sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharyngeal valves is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Thereafter, the virus may disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In patients tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken in deep respiratory tract by aspiration catheter, or a burning (expectoration) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charity in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR) and was the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the specific RdRp gene at SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the emergency authorization of the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR.In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CCD) distribute their diagnosis system by RT-PCR in real time of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, one in three genetic test obtained non-conclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a testing bottleneck at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day have been successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only at this time that federal and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorisation.The U.S. commercial laboratories started testing early in March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of NCVOID-19 tests based on the RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also distributed nationally COVID-19 tests on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. Sample collection and treatment must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Centre for Research in Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID-19 infection detection test.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be carried out in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use permit (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Holic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S. from the FDA for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that is specifically related to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is developing in Taiwan, hoping that it can deliver results in 15-20 minutes, as a rapid flu test.
A literature study of March 2020 concluded that "pulmonary X-rays present a low diagnostic value at the early stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometry] can be conclusive even before symptoms appear."
Typical symptoms visible on the TDM include multi-lobary bilateral depolitic glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, a "crazy Paving" and a consolidation are developing as the disease evolves.
A study comparing the PCR to the TDM in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that the TDM is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, several of its imaging results coincident with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that "TDM is not used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19".In March 2020, the CDC recommended the PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and under population surveillance. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CTA) or by patient hair test (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The high-speed automated systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For the CTA, only one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples may be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, only one blood sample is generally taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody testing.
On 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation.Fin March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
The antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the onset of the infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the testing kits to the antibodies purchased by the country was sufficiently efficient to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan in which suspicious cases may remain at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube," patients crack inside, refer it and receive the result of the test later.The British NHS has announced that it is carrying out a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient will infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the context of the COVID-19 test drive for suspected cases, a health professional takes a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The drive centres allowed South Korea to perform one of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Mandatory Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that it had the capacity to perform some 12,000 outpatient tests per day, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only the positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that by the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to the 12/2020 week and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) had obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples from 64 patients at once, by grouping samples and only by testing if the combined sample is shown positive.In Wuhan, an unlikely 2,000-square-metre emergency detection laboratory known as "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese, i.e., "Fiel of Fire" in French) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, and can handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
Thanks to its five-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, modelling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Multixed free models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without liquid manipulator robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation has led some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes to continue testing.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing most of its population per capita for the Coronavirus, and were in the process of intensifying the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results have been achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct test drives and the purchase of a population-wide high-speed laboratory with Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to manufacture kits sent to low-income countries without the necessary resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centres was published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems at the level of reliability of testing kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and testing recommendations of health specialists.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programs as a better means of slowing down the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has resulted in the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in the United States private laboratories, and the reserves of chemical tails and reagents have been exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the CDC-developed test kits presented "failure."The government eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that were hindering private tests.Spain purchased test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it was found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be related to the inability to collect samples or to use kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it will remove the kits that have produced incorrect results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic have produced false results. Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits in China that have proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey purchased in China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million testing kits in China, but announced early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The screening, followed by the quarantine of those who achieve a positive result and the tracing of persons who have been in contact with the carriers of SARS-CoV-2, has yielded positive results.
The researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place of the first death linked to the COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the entire population of about 3,400 people, to about ten days apart.
Almost half of the people who achieved a positive outcome did not have symptoms, and all of the cases found were quarantined.
With the restriction of movement in the commune, this measure has completely eliminated the new infections.
As a result of aggressive contact tracing, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay at home on March 28, but the schools reopened at the scheduled date at the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, entry, screening and quarantine restrictions, but with less aggressive confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that performed the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have significantly lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and whose national laboratories only have limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten first negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to perform confirmation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the table below, the "Positative as % of tests" column depends on the national screening policy.
A country that does not prove that people admitted to the hospital will have a positive value as a percentage of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they present symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Handwashing, also called hand hygiene, is due to the cleaning of hands to remove dirt, fat, micro-organisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, e.g. diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via oro-fecal.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold can be contracted, for example by omitting to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands in soap at five key moments of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning the butts of a baby or changing its layers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
If you have no water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands in ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the layers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after having bitten or coughed/swimmed;
after affecting an animal, animal food or waste of animal origin;
Hand hygiene in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medicines or providing medical care may prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of handwashing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of infectious causes of diarrhoea; and reduction of respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate during births at home.
According to a study carried out in 2013, improved hand hygiene practices could result in a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, respiratory and diarrhoea-related infant mortality rates can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soap handwashing.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by nearly 50%.
Action to promote hand-washing could reduce diarrhea episodes by about one third, comparable to that obtained by supplying low-income regions in drinking water.
Washing your hands in soap enables 48 per cent to reduce diarrhea episodes and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent acute diarrhoea and respiratory infections (IRA). This is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which is nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia lead to the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the practice of hand washing with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and almost half of the deaths due to diarrhea and one quarter of the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is generally associated with other health measures in the water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
Washing hands also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deletion, frequent handwashing can damage the skin by causing skin desiccation.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive handwashing could lead to eczema or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly frequent among health workers.
Too common handwashing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands in soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (mixing, disinfection), after cleaning the buttocks of a baby (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
It is also appropriate to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after handling a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or biting, after affecting animal waste or handling animals and after having affected garbage.
In many countries, the rate of soap hand cleaning is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 with 54 countries and on hand hygiene, 38.7 per cent of households on average washed their hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the rate was the highest (97 per cent), the United States was in the middle of the table (77 per cent) and China had the lowest rate (23 per cent). Today there are several methods for changing behaviours and democratizing the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. In particular, it is possible to propose to schoolers to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day for children to make that act a habit.
For example, the Philippine Ministry of Education has implemented a "primary health care program" to promote the health and education of children.
Deparasition twice a year, associated with daily handwashing with soap and daily toothbrush with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
In order to better eliminate micro-organisms on the skin, we need to add soap or detergents to the water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic soils, are hardly soluble in the water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap found that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also states that “automatic liquid soap distributors are preferable”.
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to people who are concerned with their health status.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants allows to target organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms are resistant.
Therefore, although antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the active and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's School of Public Health indicated that common knowledge was as effective as antibacterial knowledge for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and remove hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of warm water did not help to reduce microbial burden on the hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, non-aqueous-based non-alcoholic hand hygiene products (such as hydro-alcoholic solutions, anti-septic solutions for hands or disinfectants for hands) began to become popular.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbon dioxide (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or to a wetter such as glycerine in order to obtain liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide reinforces antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to 35 decibels) of bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands as well as the interstices between fingers and nails for about 30 seconds, until liquid, foam or gel dry.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing rather than using hydro-alcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their quick elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by skin moisturizers and/or moisturizers.
The effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcohol solutions are rare.
The fact that hydro-alcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis made them more attractive than washing hands to water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, the disinfectants for the hands are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The efficacy of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands depends heavily on the ingredients and the formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas using benzalkonium chloride have shown a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is mitigated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and who use ash or land instead.
Ashtray or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Furthermore, if the soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it is likely to increase the spread of diseases rather than stop it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hands be washed properly to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wet your hands with cold or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make any difference).
Swallow a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Fleetter for at least 20 seconds.
The action of friction creates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and to rub more germs.
Rinse enough into the running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant watershed can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or free air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily recommendated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and enamelled nail polish can host microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes skin damage that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economic alternatives to hand-washing when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, water flow from a suspended or perched gourd and/or use as needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as typpie-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging hook using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand-drying is an essential part of the hand-drying process, but the best way of hand-drying in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air towels.
After the washing and drying of hands in warm air-drying, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased on average 194% on the thumb pulp and 254% on the palms.
Dry-drying in jettisoning resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the thumb pulp and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was cross-contamination potential with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each method of drying.
The air-jet-dryer, which blows air out of the aircraft at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling micro-organisms from the hands and the device and of potentially contaminating other toilet users as well as the environment of the toilets in a perimeter up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-air dryer allows micro-organisms to be broadcast at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres of the hand-dry.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Product und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different handdry manufacturers, and the handdryers were compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in a medical setting became mandatory well after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent hospital conditions.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
Medical washing of hands must last for at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to bite and rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by walking between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
Since the germs in the water are likely to stay on hand, it is important to rinse and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents hands from being re-contaminated to contact the surfaces.
The goal of handwashing in health structures is to remove pathogens ("growls") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand-cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, a large number of doctors and nurses who regularly forget to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hands-washing and follow-up of other simple procedures may reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed to wash and rub hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect feedback from netizens.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Devices available in trade can measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Indications" on Hand Hygiene as follows:
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After contact with the patient, adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (we know "medical" or "antimicrobials") provides the hand washing agent with an action to destroy germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing a surgical operation or in environments where antibiotics-resistant organisms are very common. To "frote" their hands for surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without being touched by hands, a washing product based on chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels to dry their hands after washing them, a sterile brush to fry them and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewels must be removed.
Under this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
No need to rub hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should be prevented from flowing up to the hands.
Once hands are washed, hands should be dried using a sterile linen and a surgical coat should be wrapped.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained at the first 20% of washing, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
If we compare the washing of hands with an ordinary soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing the cleaning of hands with an alcohol-based solution and the washing of hands with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, it is observed that the first reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A virus (H1N1) and Clostridium spores that are difficult in hand. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care institutions, it is possible, inter alia, to train staff in hand washing, to make more alcohol-based products available to it and to send written and verbal reminders to it.
More research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap-washing is considered an inexpensive and essential tool to preserve health or even to feed properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash your hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash your hands near private or public toilets, despite economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than to lack of soap or water.
The promotion of soap-washing and awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence political decisions, highlight the benefits of this practice and lead to a change in behaviour in the long-term within the population.
In order to achieve this, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand-washing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to promoting hand-washing in schools, one can cite the example of UNICEF's "Third Star Approach ", which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can switch from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene campaigns that are carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
The World Day of Handwashing is another example of an awareness campaign that claims to promote behavioural development.Following the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji depicting handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing in developing countries compared to the number of healthy years of life earned (i.e. avoided DALY).
However, one magazine suggests that the promotion of soap-washing is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand-washing for human health, especially for persons in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers injured in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing care".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmes.
In the 1980s, food-borne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The emergence of swine flu in 2009 and the incidence of COPID-19 in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters showing "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and toilets in office and airport buildings.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It came from a Bible verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression was widely used in some English communities.
In Macbeth, from Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands compulsively to try to clean up an imaginary stain, symbol of her bad conscience in view of the crimes she has committed and that she has encouraged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering having committed or considered ethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and give more value to hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual washing of hands put forward in many religions, including Bahaism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, washbasin in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hand washing for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash their hands before and after every meal.
VOCID-19 risk controls at the workplace
The VOCID-19 risk controls at the workplace refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls vary according to workplace and tasks, based on an exposure risk assessment, community severity and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, lower exposure-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic measures to prevent infection are recommended, including hand-washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory label, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Jobs at risk of medium exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact with persons without suspected or known VOCID-19, but which may be infected due to ongoing Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density work environments and some large-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of individual protective equipment in case of encounter with a person with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with suspected or known VOCID-19 with a high risk of exposure, to be at very high risk if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or manipulation of individuals with suspected or known VOVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to take care of others or fear possible exposure.
Commercial models can change, both with regard to the goods requested and the means to acquire them (including running out of rush hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of articles from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 may be discontinued. A preparation and response plan for infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protection measures.
The plans take into account the risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors related to the family and community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also outline the controls necessary to deal with these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemics.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities of their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms a comprehensive framework used in occupational health and safety in order to group risk controls by efficiency.
Where the risks of VOCID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are the technical controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protective equipment.
Technical controls involve the isolation of employees from work-related risks without the need to rely on the behaviour of workers, and they can be the most economical solution to implement them.
Administrative controls identify changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (IPE) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the worker's risk, properly adapted as required (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or discarded to avoid any contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic measures to prevent the recommended infection for all workplaces include frequent and thorough handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, the respiratory label, including covering the mouth and nose for coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and trash, preparing for telework or working hours when needed, deterring workers from using other tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Early identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons are a crucial step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and others at a workplace.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with acute respiratory symptoms stay at home until they have no more fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of febrifuges or other symptom-related medicines. They also advise that flexible sick leave policies be applied, allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk jobs include those requiring frequent or close contact at less than six feet (1.8 m) of persons without suspected or known VOCID-19, but which may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to an ongoing Community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to a region with a widespread transmission of VOCID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, in schools, high population density working environments, and some high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of high-risk groups of high-risk air filter filters, the increase in ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as high-density work environments and certain high-volume retail environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at high-risk include the installation of high-risk air filter filters include the installation of high-efficient high-level air filter filters, the increase in air filters, the installation of physical barriers, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic glass windows, the establishment of transparent plastic glass windows and transparent plastic working hours and the installation of a drive window window window window for the customer service, the interruption of non- and  simply-essential and  simply-essential travel to regions with areas of COVID-19 active epidemics epidemic epidemic epidemics; the protection of the protection of emergency management plan plan, the protection of emergency management plan plan plan

Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person becomes ill on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: to separate the patient from others by 6 feet, to appoint a crew member to take care of the patient and to offer a protective mask to the patient, or to ask the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose using handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when dealing with a ill passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the patient is suffering from fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected subsequently. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, the risk controls shall include the deferral of the journey in case of disease and the immediate isolation and information of the medical on-board centre if a fever or other symptoms are developed once on-board.
Ideally, medical follow-up must take place in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and childcare, CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has gone to a school building, irrespective of community spread.
In the case of minimal to moderate Community transmission, social distance strategies may be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational exits, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical or choral education or meals at the canteen, increasing the space between offices, increasing the hours of arrival and exit, reducing non-essential visitors and using separate infirmary for children with influenza symptoms.
In the event of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays can be considered. For the law enforcement forces carrying out daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Command forces officers who are required to contact persons with suspected or confirmed VOCID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the port of adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belts prior to re-use using a laundry or spray detergent household and follow the standard procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPEs, as well as the containment and washing of clothing.
The OSHA considers certain health and funeral workers as belonging to high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known CVID-19.
They become highly exposed workers if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling of samples of patients with suspected or known CVID-19.
Procedures producing aerosols include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchials, some dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
High exposure funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of the bodies of persons with suspected or known VOCID-19 at the time of their death; they are subject to very high risk of exposure if they practice autopsy. The additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known VOVID-19, including when performing procedures producing aerosols.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral settings.
Samples must be handled using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering separate waiting rooms be separated according to the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working less than 6 feet of patients with a suspected infection or known by SARS-CoV-2 and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 approved NOSH or superior respiratory masks must be used in the context of a complete and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide better protection and better comfort from the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask only by screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, support or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of procedures producing aerosols, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or a facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In case of procedure producing aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a patient COVID-19 to persons directly involved in its care, the use of PPE required for the specific task only, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of PPE and deterring the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

OBJECT: [Cavid-19] Lighting the burden and preparing the future
DATE/HOUR OF STORAGE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE : CC0 : No rights reserved
This month we are in an exceptional situation.
The epidemic of COVID-19 is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and of the responsibilities that we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of global community empathy, cooperation and strengthening that is at the heart of this organization.
The fellowship and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the opportunity to work.
I could not be more grateful and proud of you all to be among my colleagues.
Last week, someone thanked me for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the moment, and the strong symbol of the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we will make consistent adjustments on how we work together from next week.
Adjustments to Our Work and Time Jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our use of time in the days and months to come.
During this conversation, we have considered what we believe would be a suitable response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we were trying to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take back, don't worry.
To all staff members, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily working time target will be about 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week until new order.
We do not declare holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, race, or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or pay leave required: just prevent your superior and help your team to review time schedules and jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive with COVID-19, please prevent Bryan from the T&amp;C Ops department to help you and make sure your situation gets the necessary attention from management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced it, and we reiterate our commitment to honoring our responsibilities to our subcontractors and our colleagues in the working hours.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of his usual working hours under normal conditions.
It's true if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to eliminate their stress in the world around us.
What we are doing can be incredibly gratifying, especially in times like this one.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are certain things that we must continue to do.
SRE Teams, HR Ops, &amp; Trust Security and Fund Collection (among others) perform essential work that may require backup.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slow down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice as hard to catch up on time" when the pandemic will pass.
We will not ask you to do overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines now.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set new objectives and timetables if necessary.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to our daily working time objectives, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to set up a budget to enable employees to focus on essential work, care for them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or wish to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This prolongation of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, by excessive caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution of hospital quality to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own protocol of due diligence, which uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork site, which shared with us and all the staff members based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a premises in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues are working at a distance for the first time.
Our usual colleagues in remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reducing the duration of meetings to meetings for up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider apportioning them over several days.
clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and online exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or make collective notes).
Send an electronic mail to the technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your welfare refund for snacks.
Join the #remote channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR operations team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community subsidy to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the a-ton-edits, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions might make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized in the event of delays or changes to those objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both of sadness in the face of turmoil and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT is working on creating a page on Méta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns all of us and we are here to help you in any way.

b'Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is an enzyme related to the external face (cellular membranes) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestine cells.
The ACE2 against the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a zinc-containing methyloenzyme on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a N-term peptidease M2 domain and a C-terminal amino acid carrier collectrine domain.
The ACE2 is a single-pass membrane type I protein, whose active enzyme domain is exposed on the surface of the lungs cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of the ACE2 is sliced from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood flow and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is connected to the cellular membrane mainly of cells of type II pulmonary alveols, enterocytes of the grain intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial cells of smooth muscles in most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 RNA is also presented in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate the ACE.
The ACE climates angiotensin I hormone in angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ACE2 cleves amino phenylamine angiotensin II carboxyle (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also clique several other peptides including [de-Arg9]-bradykinine, apeline, neurotensine, dynorphine A, and ghreline.
The ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus originating in SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus originating in COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the S1 strain protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 to the cell surface results in endocytosis and in both virus and enzyme translocation in endosomes within cells.
This process of entry also requires the initiation of the S protein by the TMPRSS2 host serum protein, the inhibition of the SMPRSS2 protein is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing the levels of ACE2 in cells can contribute to the fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended continued standard treatment using ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 demonstrated that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant reduction of the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to test subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ECA inhibitors who presented a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular CVA victims and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less evident than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The human recombinant angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) is presented as an innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolisaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people who tolerate conventional renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS) or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. RhACE2 under infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome treatment.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 coronary virus pandemic, i.e. identification of persons ("contacts") likely to be contacted with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the government in certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on the tracing of the geographic location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has, for its part, opted for an application named TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computer community, it has been provided as an open source and will be delivered to the government. Northern Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application to track exposure to potentially infected people and to communicate quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Department of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the tracking of contacts was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are planning to set up applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a management application for patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis and resident in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, raised several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple only authorizes "official" or generally trustworthy organizations to add cronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists expressed concerns about the implications of coronovirus applications for mass monitoring, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to address the cronovirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have set out eight requirements for government projects:
the monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extensions of control and surveillance should include termination clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the COVID-19 control objectives;
data security and anonymity should be protected in a demonstrated manner;
digital monitoring should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
Protection against abuse and appeals should be provided for citizens in the event of abuse;
The “significant participation” of all “stakeholder stakeholders” would be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of monitoring by deleting the mechanism of tracing the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, the network tracing was approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present important potential privacy issues.
However, all central server-based systems do not need access to personal localization data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercom, allowing privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used for contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transactions data, which they subsequently associated with in order to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made localization information accessible to the public, which was authorized following the profound changes in the privacy of information laws after the Mers epidemic affected that country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems that preserve privacy.
The details had not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of privacy-respecting contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data from 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-respecting solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly named Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all matching is done on the device.
The Privacy Group of the MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques in the collection and use of localization or contact data to monitor the propagation of the COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace de Enigma MPC platform, a company that develops privacy technologies originally based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and authorities without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the NCT International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and primarily equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, a key factor in their adoption by a broad audience.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would enable privacy and involve Low Energy Bluetooth technology and encryption ensuring confidentiality.
They have also published the specifications of basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create official privacy-respecting coronary artery tracking applications
Direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to solve the problems of adopting the solution and persistence of monitoring by initially distributing the system through updates of the operating system and subsequently deleting it in the same way once the threat is removed.
The repositioning of a drug (also called reorientation, reprofilation, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) means the conversion of an approved medicine for a disease or for a medical condition other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 and plasma transfusion of convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with several binding sites.
The analysis of these liaison sites provides the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are the Papain-type protease, dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and PDA ribose phosphate.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is also an anti-palude drug used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that the related chloroquine and hydrochloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the New York State tests on chloroquine and hydrochloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydrochloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency authorisation (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the U.S. only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Physicians indicated that they should use this medicine "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in association with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School performs a test on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipyravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average period of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who had not received it.
In a Wuhan study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipyravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence for the medicinal product is minor and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the medicine in Japan for its reserves and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for the Trump administration to acquire the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who are trying to grow up.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded "no benefit was observed."
These drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado tried to change these drugs to find a compound that would be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several phyloviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one involving people suffering from moderate pathology and the other on those suffering from more serious forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on vitamin C intravenously for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The New York State began testing of azithromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Comprehensive Health and Medicine (NCGM) provides for a clinical trial of Teijin's alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a Phase II test is being conducted with 200 patients to be recruited among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults aged 40 years and older who have been diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding or do not have an effective contraception method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients and studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on the repositioning of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also under way in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many attempts to develop are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, a virus that caused the disease, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in phase I safety study.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic was declared worldwide in 2020, generating important investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, ECI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The targets of the main platform passed in phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 Adenoviral vector)
As ECI scientists have stated in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are at the first stages of development, including 78 (79 from the Milken Institute) confirmed as assets and 37 other announced, but with little public information available (presumed in the course of planning or design).
A phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, controlled against placebo and carried out in several centres, determining more precise effective doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccines (in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment phase (always in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pinch vaccine that would genetically alter viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced that it had started working on a vaccine, which was expected to start in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese disease control and prevention centre on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
About 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, headed by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with her partner in biotechnology, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neo-antigen vaccine used for cancer treatment.
On 25 March, the Director of the Research Institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and started testing.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that he had started a vaccine project to create a Ii-Key peptides vaccine against VOCID-19.
They wanted to produce a candidate vaccine that could be tested in man "in 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project for the development of a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both west of Maryland, announced working on a vaccine.
About 10 March 2020, the Emergent Biosolutions announced to join Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced preclinical test projects and a phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedures, it would take about one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a Québec biotechnology company, reported developing a particle similar to the coronavirus thanks to the partial funding of Canadian health research institutes.
The candidate vaccine is in the process of laboratory research, with human tests scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian announced that U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac "a substantial amount of money to benefit from exclusive access to the Vaccine against the COVID-19", which led to the protest of the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a NRA-based vaccine.
The BNT162 NRA-based vaccine candidate is currently in preclinical test phase with the start of the clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the man test for its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium for the search of a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to US$29 million.
The other ECI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing the animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifier COVID-19 RNA vaccine.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of sending the sequence by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian societies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million C dedicated to the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 with plans to create a national "vaccination Bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronovirus epidemics occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh University of Medicine School reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, claiming that "the subunits of vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1 administered by micro needles triggered an important response of antigen specific antibodies [where mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the design of a candidate DNA vaccine in the form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteria, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against the virus SARS-CoV-2 through the immune system.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with cloud-based computer resources hosted by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia includes 4,170 health professionals.
It is possible that the vaccines under development are not safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need to implement level 3 biosafety containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there was no curative or protective vaccine against SARS that demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven vaccine against SARS.
When MERS spread, existing SARS research was thought to serve as a model for developing vaccines and medicines for MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, only one vaccine against the MERS (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were in progress; all vaccines were in viral vector, two with adenovir vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVA) and one with MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social media have spread a conspiracy theory that the virus that originated the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronovirus strains such as SARS coronovirus.
Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronovirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Current symptoms include fever, cough and breathlessness.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases result in moderate symptoms, some develop towards viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 588,000 people have been cured. The virus spreads mainly in close contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
As these droplets are produced at expiry, they usually fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then by touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious during the first three days following the onset of symptoms, although the contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during later stages of the disease. The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the actual-time polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing masks by the general public vary, some authorities discourage their use, others recommend their use, and others impose their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most of the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and exhaustion.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or thoracic pressure, confusion, walking problems, face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal flow or throat disease may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease may cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that all infected people will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of 166 infections detected today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectoration and saliva can both carry important viral loads.
Talking loudly releases more drops than talking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that coughing without protection can project drops at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patient's chambers produced positive samples to the viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR) may disperse respiratory secretions and thus lead to air spread.
Although there are concerns about seed spread, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if one does not know exactly what ease the disease is spreading, one person generally contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus could be detected at the end of one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and at the end of four hours on copper at 99%.
This varies, however, depending on humidity and temperature.
So the soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap-based products degrade the lipid protective layer of the virus, which deactivates it and eliminates the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glucone (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, salt samples were taken on average two days after initiation of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three patients with pneumonia related to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease home.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) which is the most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicule" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac lesions were reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is severe.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardium lesions may also be associated with ECA 2 receptors in the heart.
The receptors of ACE 2 are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with unfavorable prognosis. Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropic for respiratory tract epithelial cells expressing ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, GM-CSF secretory T cells have been associated with the recruitment of flammable monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported to autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the actual-time polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The test is generally performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinoparyngeal sampling; however, nasal or excectoral sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours or up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, however they require two blood samples taken at two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronovirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independently of chain polymerization reaction tests (CPR) to detect virus infection.
On 4 April 2020, antibody tests (possible to detect active infections and a person's previous infection) were under development, but not widely used.
The Chinese test experience revealed a accuracy of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test near the patient on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobed bilateral depolial glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
P pleural dominance, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings in autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuresis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytary hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASD) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of excesses in alveolary cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuko-erythroblast reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Proper hands hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered by a fabric in public places, in order to limit transmission in case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with large groups by stopping schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling large groups of people.
Distance directives also include compliance with a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known drug to be effective in the prevention of VOCID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element of the management of VOCID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "applating the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having smoked, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends the use of a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for commercial hands are not available, WHO offers two formulae for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is "not an antiseptic active substance for the hands".
Glycerol is added as moistant.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and the support of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being carriers of the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, lifestyle and healthy diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments may be useful for those who have moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized people for CVID-19.
Resuscitation and pneumologists in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the BICC.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment of COVID-19.
Regarding symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the front line.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in terms of care when performing procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends placing the person in a isolation room suitable for airborne infection (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions. The CDC stresses the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (IPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: EPP blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, priority is given to respiratory masks (face masks).
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
Where masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial protective screens, or as a last resort, hand-crafted masks.
The majority of cases of VOCID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases is.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized individuals. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-flow nasal canal or positive pressure of double-level respiratory tract.
It is not known whether either generates the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some physicians prefer to hold to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal canal. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, and in particular those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to treat a sudden peak of the number of cases of VOCID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
The mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASD) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering pressure control modes and high PEEP are required to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of pulmonary damage associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are the subject of clinical trials.
Redesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
Antiviral medication can be tried in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary plasma authorization of persons who are competitive as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It was not submitted to the necessary clinical trials to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "near contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. The analysis of massive data on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone localization and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and those with whom they have been contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel enabled security agencies to locate mobile phone data of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was intended to ensure respect for quarantine and to protect persons who could have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared aggregate telephone localization data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, the Regional Health Minister Giulio Gallera stated that he was informed by mobile telephone operators that "40 per cent of people continue to move."
The German government has held a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called on the world to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease may have a moderate change with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover in two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on similar virus data, such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASD) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-visceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicaemia, clotting disorders and heart, kidney and liver lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of cases hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal impairment being observed in 4% of those in this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19 have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five were spent in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of between six and 41 days.
In a study by the National Chinese Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples present widespread alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image looks like an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, high troponin-rate cardiac lesions or cardiac arrests were observed.
According to data from March from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had preexisting diseases. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region can also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the disease mortality rate vary due to these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
Sub-renumbering moderate cases can lead to overstatement of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have a 2.4 times higher risk of going into intensive care or dying from non-smokers. Concerns also occurred compared to long-term sequelae of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital administration has seen a 20% to 30% drop in respiratory capacity in some people who are cured of the disease, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic lesions.
This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection had an effective long-term immunity in people who were cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered to be likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of persons healing the COVID-19 followed by positive coronary artery tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be a worsening of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and animal-born, by propagation of the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost only led by a human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first occurrence of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, therapeutic options, time since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health.
At the end of 2019, WHO has affected the emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for confirmed laboratory deaths of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in a laboratory. The death/case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time range.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global death/case ratio is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the rate of infectious lethality (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed or not) people who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected persons develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, generating a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths related to the COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overflowed.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to VOCID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in both men and women.
Human mortality is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk among 50-year-olds is the difference between men and women disappearing only at 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% in men and 1.7% in women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors could be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a lower age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of the deceased of the COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data related to the type of COVID-19 infection.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means crown, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of people, in accordance with international recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as "coronovirus" and "huhan coronovirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of provisional 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease for virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as valves and respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in due time, a local startup retroconverted and printed the 100 required valves in one night.
After the initial epidemic of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and rapidly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to certain other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY trial to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are researched.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response from the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, sub-unit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these research focuses on the S-ply protein that helps the virus infiltrate into the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new vaccination creation technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are under way.
Seven trials have evaluated treatments already approved against malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Converted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials on redesivir in several countries expected to report at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of candidates for vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicinal products are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Interim data suggest the effectiveness of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with medesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require independent analysis of research.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan virology institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that twice the dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorisation at the discretion of physicians treating patients of COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese directives also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating a low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial-particle protein starting with serum 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limits that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of VOCID-19.
Cytokinic shock can be a complication at later stages of severe VOCID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic shock-related properties. Tocilizumab was included in the guidelines for treatment by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
Phase 2 is being unrandomised at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to be the cause of the death of certain affected individuals.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of cytokine re-recreation syndrome refractory to steroids induced by a different cause, treatment with CAR T cells in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of the SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have healed VOCID-19 to those who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinative method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody processing can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serum from convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronovirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
