Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
The sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter on Thursday over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a windsuit (a combination equipped with wings), it passed to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate shrine, located more than 3,000 metres high, where many badads had gathered to observe its exploit.
A black box in your car?
While the planners of the U.S. road network have difficulty finding the money needed to repair the self-infrastructure in decreption, many have a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record all thousands of cars and transmit information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to reshape the obsolete system of funding for major U.S. roads.
The generally uninterested sector in the planning of the major axes has suddenly led to a heated debate and the alliances that have been set in motion.
The libertarians joined environmental groups to press for the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly of the road you travel on, and then use the information to draft a bill of taxation.
Tea Party landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are unable to agree on whether to continue, several States have not expected.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental shift.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It's not like we had a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, who expects the state to start recording the miles traveled by each Californian car by 2025.
There will be change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded by the taxes that Americans pay to the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as before.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply not tenable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His State recently had tracers installed on 500 cars to test a payment system by mile.
"It turns out to be the most logical option in the long term," he said.
Wonks calls this a mile usage fee.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious climate warming laws.
But Mr. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, said that he also regarded it as the most viable alternative in the long term.
The open market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of getting drivers paid on the mile.
"It's not just a tax in a large black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of the policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for their benefits.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the way of payment to the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have taken about 10,000 cars.
But the House Presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many miles every day to go to work or to town.
However, several States and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay to the state of kilometre charges instead of petrol taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States along the east coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) explores how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists have recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their minor actions and actions.
"Big Brother's concerns and these kinds of things are a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategic management of performance at the Nevada Transportation Department.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into full-scale localization devices."
There is no need to build an enormous and encapsulated technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep the records of the people's daily trips and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now moving to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but not knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California start-up named True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to assist motorists who pay taxes to States.
She sought to perch in the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices that it tested have been a pleasure for the planners of the major axes because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do that if you do not record their speed and do not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive ways and ways to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experiment by offering drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have any equipment at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of thousands travelled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking costs, provide "buying" insurance and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Automobilists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits offered by the system," said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the entire debate on the payment by mile is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation San Francisco Bay Area Commission, officials say that Congress could simply manage the Highway Trust Fund bankruptcy by increasing fuel taxes.
A single or additional annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that each pays its fair share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the Director of Law and Public Affairs at the Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished Listeners
The English musician did not finish to surprise this year.
From The Next Day, released in January, he concocted a luxury edition scheduled for November 4, with several unpublished ones.
Four have already emerged on the Toile.
The announcement of the release of a new David Bowie album had left everyone Pantois.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he declared that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that one could still rely on him to spark the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to re-edit this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he had a real feast for his fans.
This edition, called The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already released.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three songs of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, above all, it gives a foretaste of its new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a highly mastered rock electricity.
Unpublished people already listening
But Atomic is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informer is double-faced: a worrisome intro before a light ride that slows progressively to leave room for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, Bowie wanted to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, even to Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie again made reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The riffs of guitar, enveloping, gave the desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie is having fun playing the chameleon with these titles: turn-in informant, man on a rocket, potential mar...
He conceals and reveals at the same time, he plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast as of 10 November.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the army were following a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive the appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - who do not meet the army's "university of service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London reservist in Ontario, has been released from the army, despite his request to stay another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary commission last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not respond to the universal rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared from, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with La Presse Canadienne on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was any way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been unable to determine the latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not fit for the fight.
Under the current rules, severely injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year to Parliament indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 did not reach the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
The Liberal Spokesperson for Veterans, Jim Karygiannis, asked on Wednesday for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while the neo-Democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney put on tablets to launch a animated series
The American Media and Entertainment Group has decided to focus the tablets on its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is only scheduled in 2014, details of its Disney Junior Division communiqué.
The cartoon, for children aged 2-7, tells the adventures of Callie, sheriff of a city in the West of America where she makes the order with a magic laxo.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice-President of Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the communiqué.
This kind of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the life of his series and build new relationships with his audience through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A poll published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age already had a tablet or telephone, and 72% of children under 8 years of age, respectively 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on the question of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. Intelligence Service Reporter, stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Thursday Mr Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the outcome of my efforts has been obviously positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the German Interior, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
The relations between the United States and Germany were severely tested as a result of complaints that the NSA had overheard the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who runs the parliamentary group that oversees foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without putting him at risk and completely ruining relations with the United States", he had to take advantage of it.
Mr. Ströbele, German Green MP, posted a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
On his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele stated that according to former NSA consultant counsel, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden was testifying in Germany, he should be assured that he would be safe there, the Member said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a campaign of "serious and sustained" persecution that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global reaction to "my act of political expression".
Citizens from all over the world, as well as senior officials – including in the United States – felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent monitoring was of public use.
The letter made an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Câble subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix's on-demand video service via their television in a future that does not seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary said Thursday she was conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"It will allow us to develop more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," explained Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet in interview.
Cogeco Câble thus engrosss the step to its competitors, like Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary still has no specific date in relation to this new platform.
"It is necessary to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Mr.Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Rogers' telecommunications giant already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which were not mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service claims to be in discussions with some major cable distributors to make its service available via their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in his Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for the services on the map.
"It's been about two and a half years ago that we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important channels packages, it doesn't work," said Mr.Audet.
He hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CCTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"There must emerge from these discussions a new kind of framework of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television," Cogeco said.
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco reported having recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢ per share.
This is a decrease compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 ¢ per share, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decline due to amortization costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Companies, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As for Cogeco's incomes, they experienced an increase of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90 ¢ per share, in decline compared to 45.7 million, or 93 ¢ per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's incomes increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet doesn't worry about the number of customers fluctuating like that.
For me, this is not the indication of a change of trend, did he observe.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very intense competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat was detected in cans of beef-based products, sold by two small British low-price distribution teachers, today announced the food hygiene agency.
Routine tests revealed that the products, produced in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save channels, contained horse DNA at 1 to 5%.
"As the horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four, early Friday, on Road 131, in Lanaudière.
Just before 4h, a car driver traveling north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car arriving in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
Traffic returned to normal around 6:00 a.m., Friday.
Border Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
Border Airlines plans to pay up to $100 for passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Border Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that the passengers could take the cane not open with them at the descent of the plane.
The new hand luggage charges relate to bags placed in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that it would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the fares in advance.
"We do not want to pay this price," she explained.
The airlines started paying for the first and second bags recorded in 2008.
The passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as many things as they could in the luggage in the upper compartments, so there was often no place in those compartments.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley stated that these new expenses will not really be used to collect money.
The aim is to help the most faithful Frontier customers understand that it becomes increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger tailing a Frontier boarding door could carry a bag free of charge, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these costs before arriving at the door.
Frontier's hand luggage charges will not be applied before summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often whisper about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay.
Many people on Wall Street consider adding baggage charges as a sign that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them did not reach baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first charges of hand luggage three years ago, and the low-cost company Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such costs is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand luggage costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines framework, recently travelled to Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover the costs of unusual hand luggage imposed by the company.
"I've never seen such a smooth boarding process of my entire career," he said.
I expected to see toothbrushes and a knock on the door.
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers are on board at the speed of the lightning."
Border also acts as Spirit and applies $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the cane not open with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways recently tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after the passengers complained and when no other large airline followed.
Frontier's decision to charge freight charges when passengers do not purchase their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it began to offer only half a thousand loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the premiums of thousands by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1000-mile frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250-mile.
It also allows passengers to choose their seats in advance only if they buy their tickets directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in his home city, Denver, but his activity retreats and he loses money.
Revenues fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic tried to straighten out Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA is calling into question an "internal error" rather than computer pirates for failure of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadow said Friday it was a bug that had caused the failure of its public site for a few hours, not hackers like some had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov has remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that occurred during a planned update," said the spy agency in a statement by email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service [DSD] attack are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been bankrupt for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the Agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the spokesperson.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for breaking the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to inundate a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the system.
The previously ultra-secret NSA, once known as the "No Such Agency", has been under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticized over the past few months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications monitoring programs at the national and foreign levels – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disseminated by the former NSA's disavowed consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency caused many speculations that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 still haven't found a new job.
Delta promises not to let her employees fall.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, met employees individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," says the Regional Director of Work Relations at the Hotel Delta, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta intervenes in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, owner of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Science Management.
Other Montreal hotels will also be converted in the next few months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling almost 600 rooms will see the day in two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employed"
After having thrown the sponge with failure in January for the partial recovery of the Goodyear site of Amiens-Nord promised to the closure, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American Titan tireman, declared himself today ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the factory counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, 21 October.
After giving up the plant's purchase project in January, you're coming back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "my-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "fous" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this face-to-face.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs from the best paid jobs.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours disabled in France.
In India, China and in the whole of other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with a proper price and competent workers, it is worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If Goodyear had provided employees with a good starting benefit since the factory's closing announcement, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now let's imagine that Titan buys Goodyear the closed factory.
As a result, Titan could move machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from some 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan commitment before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on starting allowances for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the plant.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting allowances.
If all employees accept them, the project to purchase the plant starts with zero employees.
How can we give job life assurances when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg succeeds in getting the CGT and Goodyear to agree and if Titan buys the factory, we intend to stay in North Amiens for more than four years.
The profit of Bombardier down, while deliveries and aircraft orders shrink
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure of a decrease in orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains Division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide in-flight test data for his new CSeries aircraft, nor did he provide information on whether the aircraft would meet its ambitious trading schedule by September.
After the opening flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the latter flew only three times, and the question was then asked whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not in line with the forecasts and the stock exchange fell by 8% to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from "super performance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential of the stock exchange in the next quarter or the next two quarters.
"Although the drop in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the margin of benefit in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doerksen in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will register new orders for his CSeries planes as the flight test program moves forward.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family can catapult it in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far modest to the height of 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and the potential of savings of the new line aircraft.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and CEO, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its objective of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft is put into commercial service.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the program was moving in accordance with the timetable.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground as long as expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's stopping time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and plan for an update period, and that is what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes should fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly afterwards, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first client can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was assessing the schedule of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slowness in flight tests – although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal calendar – reinforces our view that the entry into service will be delayed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter closed on September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The adjusted action result remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Income declined slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 million.
Analysts expected a 10-cent share result and revenues of $4.56 Md, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer indicated that he had delivered 45 planes during the quarter, compared to 57 years earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division was $32.9 million as at September 30, which was unchanged compared to December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Aeronautics' revenues dropped by 13% to $2 million.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway builder, said that the revenues of this division had increased from almost 11% to $2.1 Md.
The Transport Division's order card totaled $32.6 million as at September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
The Transport Division's margins have suffered from performance problems with some major contracts.
Leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share course, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of Google Inc's financial management, would sit on the board of directors, fell from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third aeronautical manufacturer in the world and competing closest to Bombardier, reported on Thursday a 10% decrease in its quarterly profit.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists had been missing in a gouffer under the Crolles' Dent since Thursday evening, we learned Friday from the Isère's help speleo.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one in practice and the other not, had left on the ground Thursday around 9:30 to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre de Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since then, and the same source was said.
"The speleologists should have emerged around 5:00 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the Speleo rescue organization.
Tens of people on site
About 20 rescuers, ten civilians members of the French Relief Speleo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
Late this Friday afternoon, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the relief teams engaged in the network," says Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in Chambéry's 13th Alpine Hunter Battalion were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, turned back on their steps in waiting for the rescue, specified the prefecture.
Refueled, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German Journalist Union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services on Thursday the day after new revelations on the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid the use of Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging," she says in a communiqué.
She considers "scandalous" the Washington Post information, according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headsquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 members.
Remarked Date: A Member Requests Brigitte Gruwels's resignation
Minister Brigitte Gruwels' project of "relifting" the signaling lamp poles in Brussels does not suit everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the centre of Brussels a test project to trace 16 points of signaling lamps from the region to the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The goal being both "to increase security" and "brought identity".
The idea is, in the end, to trace all the Brussels signaling lamps, at an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to the Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands Brigitte Gruwels' "dissemination".
"It is not happy to spend Brussels' money madly in the relifting operations of the colour signaling poles of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Gruwels continues his Flemishing Operations of the Capital," said De Bock in a communiqué.
After her yellow-black-mango-black taxis, she finally repainted herself in dark-blue-black yellow-black Brussels poles.
According to the Member, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who herself realizes the NVA program.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of the Flanders.
"For recall, Brigitte Gruwels was elected only with 2 245 votes 0.5% of Brusselsers!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the portico de Pont-de-Buis demontée
The eco-taxed portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday morning, was dismantled.
Caves arrived in place shortly after 10 hours, and traffic on the national was diverted into the crowd.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the prefecture of the Finistère Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, the portico manager.
These are the last of the three ecotax ports to operate in the Finistère department, the two others having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of a Google Glass accessory shop
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google signed online glasses.
They can thus acquire an earphone, a charger or even a storage case.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of microfibre or an intra-auricular earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father wiped out the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "frequently."
There is no recipe, no way to use it to pass the wall of the invisible and to find its own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakens in the middle of the night to watch his watch that never leaves me, placed on the night table.
It's the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my everyday actions.
Our mother left us after her full fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found her body empty, chipped on this hospital bed with cold sheets.
Similarly, his funerals were a glacial farewell focused around the thin light of candles that would fit his circle.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by day or night appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she resumed her place in the landscape of my thought that was grieving.
And then she turned out to me while revealing my own faces that I had not yet perceived, hidden by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost my mother's person but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and complete.
This diversion from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "in and out" he seemed.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I wasn't afraid of him anymore, and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I got hurt...
He talked to me, encouraged me constantly, lived my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I was able to have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It took a long time and one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said that dead people are not forgotten but invisible people.
My parents are no longer, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always mean it: what would they say? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, perhaps not every night, but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it's too late, only, there's always something that prevents me from achieving this moment.
I often wake up anxiously when it happens and I feel deeply absent.
Sometimes, certain dreams lead me to the contrary and are part of my history and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the night of my ultrasound where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed that I would wake up, get up out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he was smiling and glad I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he was sharing with me with joy what had happened to me.
And of course, he was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him, and I'm happy to tell this common memory after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
Despite everything I've done my grief pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
To learn Arabic and to be interested in the Middle East, to the point of making a master's degree in a large school, have not been, with the decline, anodine choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where he had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are always present, so I can think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same applies to my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and rightness of mind of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes laying on me.
My mother passed away nineteen years ago.
Death after talking to me on the phone.
I have passed through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying that trigger itself, wherever, whenever, in unusual places, in incongruent moments.
Then, time has eased the pain.
Only the lack, the unanswered vacuum, this need for it, to entrust me, to reassure me of its gentleness.
Yet she's there, a silent presence, she's there and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see her anxious eyes laying on me, I see the circles that brighten her gaze, the wrinkles around the lips that dig the cigarettes, the folds that mark the forehead the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of my 3 children died of cancer at age 43.
We always feel its protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile, and pronounce his name no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to him in the dark when the absence is too bad, she invites herself in my dreams when morals are a little hit.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the decline of time makes us realize how much she was head of the orchestra and we try to stay in the path she had drawn us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot remove it from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 in the aftermath of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his inhumation and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my own beliefs sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep, and I always wonder what he'll think about it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
That was soon 30 years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6.
The immense penalty that then invaded me has certainly eased but it is always close to me.
Very often he "disembark" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that awake I am even more sad to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was all right, I said no to him, he answered me "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in surprise, anxious and lit the hair lamp by looking everywhere, persuaded he was going to arrive.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I go back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all the pieces I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since I started, he's and he's gonna be the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I am gone, I am a grandmother, I am full of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the most deadly month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad published its official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day when the Prime Minister of Iraq is received by the President of the United States.
Noury al-Maliki wants US assistance.
"We don't tell the world to be with us and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what happens in Iraq is not settled, it will spread, and what happens in Syria will also spread.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Peace Institute, an independent institution created by the Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They used to make banners accusing him of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
Lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed on a large day.
He was sentenced to three-year imprisonment by the Liverpool death court
A large defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, provided sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after being committed because of his habit of cocaine consumption.
The lawyer, who was called "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "primary file", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police hearing operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officers found Sarborough, 32 years old, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a bar dinner with brothers.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought illicitly to obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for a sum of £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because she feared that her drug abuse would not be revealed on a day-to-day basis.
Today, at Liverpool's Court of Appeal, Ditta, who works in the law firm Forbes Solicitors located in Blackburn, fell in disgrace after having been found guilty on two counts of impeachment to justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had admitted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him coming to Ditta's home and placing drugs, pure to 60%, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium at the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug, and called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta collected his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a sample of hair was taken from him.
In an interrogation, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that he was being called by clients to his home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he called for major actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, "If someone should know that there is no need to break the law, he is a criminal lawyer."
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He stopped the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to pursue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored him.
He got too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has gone from criminal lawyer to criminal himself as soon as he has begun to procure drugs from criminal organizations."
Its addiction to cocaine has never compromised it and made it vulnerable to the background of the leaders of organized criminal groups who commissioned it to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of confidence with the public.
Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to shelter himself behind the varnishes of his profession.
The serious and organized crime unit in Lancashire conducted the investigation of Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three chiefs of cocaine possession and is now obstructing justice, attesting to his commitment to prosecuting criminals in court.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading with him for complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death corridor in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be back on stage in December
Detroit News reports that the queen of the soul will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
Ms. Franklin dealt with an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds in November.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering, the famous interpreter of Respect said to the media on 16 October that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometres of seaboard covered with a light coat: we could rotate the hot blow in Menton with the bill of lighting.
Bill that, unlike many municipalities, is also regulated by taxpayers, not trade associations.
To alleviate its costs, the city uses leds.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 in the morning when a man opened the fire.
According to the local police, there would have been at least 2 injured.
This would be an employee working for the United States Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the perpetrator of the fire.
The incident would have occurred at terminal 3, causing a panic wave.
Travelers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Very soon the police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being stopped.
Classic song for teenagers
Every time, the school clientele will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five skirts imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, cartoons with a strong dose of humor, adolescents are allowed to appreciate the classical song.
In addition to this show, the lyric society of the Kingdom will return with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now fills the Pulp of Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, which gives artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the lyrical appéro, the concert-benefic held last August, with the competition of the soprano colorature Marie-Éve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance that is as soft as a bat air.
Without providing specific figures, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions, the future is well, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"The finances are fleeting and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step that we will take in seven years," said the administrator.
"I would say even beyond," added the CEO Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy de Surrey school faced six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been accused of hostage-taking, kidnapping, threat-progressing, carrying a weapon in a dangerous purpose, abduction, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Package.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective redress against Saint Croix brothers
A new application for collective redress was filed against Saint Croix brothers concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time at the Saint-Joseph oratory, as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the complainant's testimony, identified as "J. J"., which would have been Masturbed in the 1950s, first to Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher the Brother Submitted, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was only about three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people told us: "I, I was at that place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective remedy that has just been filed is a particular feature of allowing the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation in Sainte Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together complaints from 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Saint Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also emphasizes that the congregation of Saint Croix and the oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and have nevertheless choked them", and that they have "consciously and consciously chosen to ignore the problem".
These charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of Sainte Croix, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research carried out in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective appeal must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility is admitted by the Court, the second stage shall be held, or the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Saint Croix had agreed to settle in a friendly manner before hearings were held on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire severely damaged a trade in the LaSalle district in Montreal, from Thursday to Friday night.
The rescue was called around 1h, Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Rejane Street.
The 30 firemen who were dispatched to the premises have spent about an hour controlling the brewery.
The fire caused "significant damage to the structure of the building," said the chief at the operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but about twenty houses, located on the first and second floors of this range of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments may have to be temporarily booked, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical help to die at Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the bill on medical assistance to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would like to end their days, according to a spokesperson from the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, the euthanasia approach would be minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical aid to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
Most palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care House Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie House in Gatineau, believes that the service would be in any way unnecessary.
We never ask ourselves, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Association des care palliatives de l'Ontario, Rick First, believes that the Quebec Bill disorients the population regarding the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario's going to go the wrong way.
On the other hand, the Liberal MP of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, states that the concept of end of life must be clarified before the bill is passed.
The Kenyan press is trespassing on the controversial media law
"It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask itself the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper by challenging the bill and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we refuse it," explained Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He indicated that the new media court "will always be biased as it is a government extension" and that restrictions on content and advertising would affect Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to the parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "manipulated on the media." The Standard stated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had a hard blow" and flogged the bill as "draconian".
At the same time, the bill was adopted by a body of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping centre last September.
The Kenyan media stirred up the anger of the authorities by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack derobed so-called the luxury shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media officer to interrogate them, although the summons were withdrawn following a riot in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "dated" or of being unable to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's animated blogosphere.
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, political men would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and picking."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of people's anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their outstanding wages of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-free – which are among the highest in the world.
A tough year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Laval Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) caused a lot of damage to the management of the City of Health Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement, maternity leave or short departures, the pharmacy department has found to be very low on staff.
Almost 30% of the necessary staff were missing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to department head Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to engage in self-employment, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
No use was made for the disposal, Ms. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities have been streamlined or reduced within the facility, the time that things move.
It's sure that we've worked hard to interest our young people [pharmacy residents] in order that they come and stay here.
There is a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is clearly easier for the department of pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain results were successful, as the four students currently in residence in Laval also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now, it's getting much better, the pharmacist pointed out.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore fill our departures last year.
Always Growing Needs
The situation, however, remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospital or a predominance of young women in the trade, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have a environment that is young and many young women are employed, so with pregnancy, we almost always run on three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
In the past year, we had a lot more, and there are no pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The top 22 year model doesn't start his career at the cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose it to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaiac, his next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will emerge in two components (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadrant in sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's appearance with his elder is striking: a brandilla silhouette, a diaphane dye and French-English origins.
Not forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to put naked on ice paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on large screen.
An extract from Nymphomanic has caused temperature to rise on the Toile: Stacy Martin appears in the bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their powder in the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the fold.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, by Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of pushing her actresses in their last retreats, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precaution, following pickles to the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the head of the facility ordered the evacuation of the room and warned firefighters for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the session.
The persons were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad lacrymogenic jet joke?
Or involuntary incident?
It is always because film management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers in full.
The room was airborne and everything came in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and customers find the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into citroules
Taking advantage of the day of Halloween, a woman tried to bring two kilograms of cocaine hidden into the country at Montreal-Trudeau Airport on Thursday mornings.
It was when the passenger luggage was examined that the drug could be detected.
Cocaine had been distributed into three citrus fruits that had been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the office of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) that took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, spokesperson for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that she came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have seized 173 drugs, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region made a total of 1653 seizures of drugs.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early in the afternoon, but strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range air surface missiles SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of Tsahal's aviation into Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in approximately the same circumstances as the one that took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American leader who confirmed at CNN an Israeli attack, targeting this time the Jakhont Solemn missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency lowered on Friday Ukraine's solvency note, questioning the capacity of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's note of public debt securities goes to "B-", focusing on the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be reduced again in a year's time.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure sufficient foreign exchange to meet its high external financing needs," the U.S. agency said.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects that the trend will continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of appropriations made abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities have resorted massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapse, the agency finds an increasingly likely devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbour, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public on the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth trimester of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has for months called for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 granted it a loan of $15.3 billion and has now released only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important needs in external funding" were "vulnerability", while "signs of economic improvement".
However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud, from the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot wait for a short-term improvement".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with presidential elections scheduled in 2015, the expert asked the PSA.
The only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P further notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels requires the release of opponent Iulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium term related to Russia's reaction," S&P explained, who fear "commercial restrictions" by Moscow.
Russia, representing the quarter of Ukrainian exports, warned that in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
U.S. Green Fire at Publicis-Omnicom Merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus bringing closer to the creation of the first world advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the time-limit for the examination of the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", both groups announce in a communiqué.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the execution of the transaction.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorities and approving shareholders of both groups," they add.
The Congolese army hunts the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units were going to hunt down the rebels from M23 to their bases in the North Kivu forests and mountains bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 is about to be beaten after being driven from the localities of the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that it has been controlling the insurrection since the beginning 20 months ago.
"We're going to pursue the M23 and take it wherever it hides because it's about criminals," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesperson for the FARDC.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
Time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they have evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the rebel political leader of the rebellion, stated on RFI that these military reversals would in no way alter his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed in Kampala on Wednesday between the Kinshasa government and M23.
Clamps are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to be fallen this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of the M23 began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the head of the North Kivu province, taking advantage of the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of staffing, strengthening its mandate and forming a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the FARDC's headquarters was remanded and the army moved to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to be reaching its end," predicts a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government succeeded in beating a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no allied armed group in Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
Experts from the United Nations accused Rwanda, which denied it loudly, of militarily supporting the M23, which was originally formed by former Congolese militaries.
British diplomat William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to hold a standstill, announced a spokesperson for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had referred to the possibility of military reprisals following shells in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived one year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to be one day freed by the army," a resident of this neighbouring Ugandan village testifies.
"We have lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatized," he added.
Tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by coronavirus were negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already caused some 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second American oil company, reported on Friday a decrease in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refinery margins, while its production of oil and gas has increased while remaining withdrawn from the Group's objectives.
The net profit of the third quarter has fallen to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit of $2.71 per share.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, increasing from the previous year's 2.52 million bpj.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in expected production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refinery margins affects the whole sector.
Thus the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil reported on Thursday a net profit going down, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) has since the beginning of the school year for the costs of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students receiving the school transport at two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested," says Mrs. Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to get together and find solutions," says Mrs. Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency of the Hôtel-Dieu
Faced with the leafy for several months by some of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, Health Minister Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "declare the schedule of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that will not be able to take place on 4 November".
An official request "to take no risk of emergency management in Paris at the beginning of winter" but also to avoid hindering the PS campaign to a few months of municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Although, in the APHP, it is preferred to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of 4 November, firefighters who were in charge of approximately a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency crossings at Hôtel-Dieu will have all received as a reminder to take 30 serious cases per day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This November 4 date also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
In the Hotel-Dieu, the emergency inmates will leave Monday to five general medical interns.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the current month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th", ensures without delay Loïc Capron, the president of the APHP Medical Establishment Commission (CME), who supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," said Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in emergency," he said, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on-site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain in place, he also ensures.
But it is up to the HRS to decide to close the emergency reception service.
"Things take place gradually," said Nicolas Péju, spokesperson for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or was lied to," laments the urgentist doctor Gérald Kierzek.
He was fired from his post as chief of the SMUR in early July to lead the leaf against the reorganisation project, he was defined as a "warning striker" in the face of a "cynic" decision made by "medical-administrative technology".
"They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are always fattened.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for the Lariboisière emergency.
In the ARS, it is argued that 30 patients "dispatched" on several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
In ARS and APHP, the "new hospital model" has been being defended since October 7 and is expected to continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also be involved in the establishment of an "outpatient care stay".
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnosis," he asks Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of non-serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
It's going to happen like for level 3 maternity wards.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care offer.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the armlet, provide Christophe Prudhomme, Emergency Physician and Health Committee member.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and will consider presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, UMP advisor to Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly states that "even if the Paris PUM was for the maintenance of the emergency at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if they were returned to responsibility".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, again recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would make her net disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesperson.
Although the restructuring of the Hôtel-God has its legitimacy on the bottom, we cannot admit it without an acceptable map of deferral to the other hospitals.
Obama ends listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama commanded the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop its listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, indicates an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to resume its hand in the NSA hearing case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the IMF and the World Bank have been monitored by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal.
Asked about this, a director of the U.S. administration replied: "The United States does not carry out electronic surveillance for World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Expressing himself under the seal of the anonymity, he did not specify whether such surveillance had been established in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered that these practices be stopped in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one that brought an end to the ears of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes on Thursday, but allowed them to continue.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and have imposed a five-year limit for the conservation of such information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began on the eve of Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to "surpass national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on the progress made within the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security-related concern in Mozambique grows while conflicts break out among powerful personalities
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, torturing them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public event.
"We want peace to return; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, general director of an investment company.
Concerned about her country's future, she exchanged her work clothes against a T-shirt with the reference to "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowded crowd in place of the Independence of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost every day reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst hangings since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-headed Rhodesia and then the apartheid Government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than 50 million dollars of investment over the next years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale do Brasil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko in the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo mutually rejects the responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is at the origin of recent clashes and has launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of Renamo on 17 October.
The attacks on former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the bases of Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesperson for Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and accuses him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told the French press agency, on Wednesday, that Mr. Dhlakama regarded himself as a "lost" who wanted to use "all the forces left to him to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the peace agreement in 1992.
He told FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"There are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open and specialized university in Mozambique.
None of them can negotiate well and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of the votes collected by Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Reamo, is expected to obtain a greater number of votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who was expected to withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has led disturbing lightning attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway axis.
Most of the hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
"People think that the people responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is the government that finds solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestant, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "lifestyle models," says the author.
Thor's Legend could show that "the brutal force does not make the weight of the russian subtle," while arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too scandalous and in some cases, too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland recommended a "careful selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it great that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have been in favour of this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "openly didactic" makes children "completely" and that the messages are "submitted" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or finished well, but there is an inborn sense of good and evil.
And it must be underlined; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis for what we show and what we don't say.
A Hamas-armed fighter was killed tonight and another was wounded by an Israeli tank shot in the Gaza Strip, and medical and security sources were learned in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they removed a shell from an Israeli shield.
NSA espionage: the United States is "too far away", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" to espionage, recognized State Secretary John Kerry, in this first Washington confession in full controversy with Europe on the mass collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant it to you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this will not happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London that he had been taking part since Washington on Thursday, October 31 by video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of US diplomacy has long justified information and information-gathering practices through the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks on 11 September 2001, the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the U.S. authorities had since engaged in many attacks through the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects," the US diplomat said.
And, said John Kerry to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way", the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal on a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday evening that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and proceed to a review of these practices so that no one would feel wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to engulf this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, which cites documents obtained from the former consultant of NSA Edward Snowden, states that the program called "Muscular", and conducted with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from optical fibers used by Internet giants.
Some 181 million items had been collected in the last month of January alone - from metadata on e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interferences would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have massively intercepted data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the U.S. press claimed that the US President was not aware of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this issue, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied him that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the ball to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and that would not mean Europe at all, said General Alexander.
And the controversy extended to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast network of international espionage that has also attracted China.
The Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without his master's backing, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League 1 club in a communiqué.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco unlike goals, broadcasted the list of players selected for this 12th day match, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The communiqué simply states that it is "broken", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee during his return of selection, at the beginning of months.
A ceremony in memory of cremated deceased persons
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 o'clock, a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematoized in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the Paris City Hall, will be attending and will explain, at a press conference, her proposals for funerals.
To follow the ceremony, click on it above.
For their own obsessions, more and more French choose cremation, rather than inhumation: 53%, according to a Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September with 109 people, instead of 47%.
For the obsessors of a close friend, it is the opposite: the French prefer the inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose the cremation.
In his book La Mort en ashres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee of Ethics of the Funerary, he insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes, for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the loved body", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in very little time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompanie the phases of mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which is due to the "effacement of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is it that which is readily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries is still ill in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Approving Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the attempts to perceive it.
Approving the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as the one to which he would have been entitled with an inhumation.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, whether they are religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now 73% of the people who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums adapted to this evolution of society.
"After ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for one and a half hours, immediately followed by the restoration of ashes," observed Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: host the assembly, name the deceased, link him to others, mention him, give meaning to his death, organize the farewell.
This has been the case with Father Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Father Lachaise has been holding, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of the memory, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who have been crematized in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is transmitted online, to the attention of those who could not make the move.
The crematorium allowed us to relax.
In The Seyne, the rat-rotation turns to controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the emergency, the Director of the Southern Habitat Lands Office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, that the couple and their three children be accommodated in a new T4.
Yet, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken an exaggerated proportion, says Joël Canapa, the head of the office.
Rats, there's always been rats in the cities.
The deratisation undertaking performs two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have had 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the rats don't pulverize in the city.
For environmental and public health reasons, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, a dog will not be killed.
"We didn't invite the rats in our house," defends the family father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the soup and are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has dropped Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating has suffered from the decline in the dollar against the yen, which is detrimental to the export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.33.
Sony dropped by more than 11% to 1 668 yen.
A house preys the flames in the Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday noon in the Old Quebec was quickly mastered.
More than 30 firefighters were deployed on the 9th of Hébert Street.
The flames appeared in a three-storey house located behind the courtyard of the Quebec Seminary.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the firemen arrived, which many were involved.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it was taking great strength to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, a spokesperson for Quebec firefighters.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman : Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the actor of vaudeville Frank Fay, who held the role of a ceremony master at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public, about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and great theatres.
"Most of the poster heads have emerged in Caroline, and have had a great success, until they have become too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We have created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for the benefit of veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, to which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival grew as big as the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians who participated in this year's festival went through non-traditional circuits, for example showing shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of the fantasy football joyfully lascif of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate took part in the program "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the casting of the series "Parks and Recreation", but is still better known for her series of viral videos " Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a unique voice (the surrealist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became a film and television director, as well as an informal historian of the comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting is held at the Hotel de Ville in central Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would come down a alley between two buildings and say, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
The oil price continues to fall and closes to $96 barrel
The price of oil continued to decline Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks compensate for a report showing that the Chinese electricity-gourmand manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The U.S. reference gross price for delivery in December dropped from 14 cents to $96.24 the barrel at the end of morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% decrease for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed the price over the last few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived Friday, showing growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to grow further after growth increased to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Gross Brent, a reference for the international crude already used by the U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to $108.58 the barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Retirement of the right to abortion in Texas
A Federal Court of Appeal restored certain restrictions on the right of voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and widely challenging the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The decision of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice IVGs will have a "privilegance of admission" to local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under his or her medical status as a carer of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to deliver a diagnosis or treatment.
IVG advocates argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, almost 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these institutions.
On Monday, a court of first instance had held that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional on the eve of the entry into force of the law.
But attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is fighting the Governor's office, asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the trial of first instance that blocked the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has achieved a strong return to the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, which is 5.6% on the audience side.
But was the show at the meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates were present at the hearings of this 10th season, to confront the jury: Maurane, the bad Sinclair, the coven André Manukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
With the excitement of regaining their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so disappointed?
No candidate really seems to have marked this first prize.
Like every year, the first hearing shows are a wide selection of weed singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, a few found their account there.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind television screens, successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make fun of it.
The Court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and search policy
On Thursday, a federal court of appeal blocked a judge's decision requiring changes in the New York Police Department's control and search program and reviewed the case.
The United States Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the conclusion of the call by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city has appealed to its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its associated policy and training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the file because it violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements in which he publicly reacted to the criticisms of the court.
The judge had ruled that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by falsely targeting black men and of Hispanic origin as part of their control and search program.
She appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras on the body in the areas where most controls were carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of retaining the names and addresses of persons who were dismissed after a police check.
The city's appeal hearing is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and search has existed for decades in a certain form, but the number of recorded controls has dramatically increased under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black men and Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
partisans advocating changes in the NYPD control and search program say that they will put an end to unfair practices, provide more effective and reliable police forces, and can change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the police's morale without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police personnel have been severely reduced in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the constitutional control and search practices, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD carried out its controls.
Renters must go to vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the housing price that goes to the City tax.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us fireworks at $100,000, land between $4 million and $5 million in case...
Let's vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef of Elysée
Entering into the 500 m2 of the Swiss cuisine as a commission after working in the embassies, the cook climbed all the steps until becoming chief nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande by going through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation sites, and fed an incalculable number of greats of this world in a quasi-anonymity that he breaks only today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years.
The man with open face, scratched skull and intellectual glasses, born October 24, 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I passed from one castle to another!", irony Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manias of the six presidents for whom he has officers, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of the state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mme Chirac was a little more involved, she came straight into the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
It does not appeal to heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to terrestrial foods, "they are all gourmets", denounces Bernard Vaussion gentilely.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates came back empty!
As for François Hollande, who has restored cheese, "someone likes to eat" and "there's no big deal that he doesn't like."
The current Head of State, who returned the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners in Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there were mistakes.
The former chef of the kitchens of the Elysée, who took a drink Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart."François Hollande came to greet me".
He said hi.
"It's human side emerged," he says.
The Chief will be replaced by his Deputy Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been in Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the shooting of flames in the Old Quebec on Friday noon.
The building of four dwellings, located on 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three alarms to the fire service.
The fire went forward, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, explained that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of flame to adjacent buildings, a challenge of size for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The house was housed in four houses, but no tenants were in the area at the time of the fire.
The damage was all limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the saviours have dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
Le Loup de Wall Street: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese escapes some images of his next film, whose role as title, that of an ambitious New York broker, is incarnate by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will decoy you in his role as a deranged trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "courtier in Long Island Stock Exchange, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast case of corruption on Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then climbed a cliff that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow its incredible ascent, but also the vertiginous fall that will follow.
Without limits, man carries on parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess of any kind are the words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had joined them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long mounting.
It looks like the film lasts at 2:45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in a fair race in the oscars.
Coulson used the phone hack to check a pipe
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "phone piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a pipe canon on a link involving the then-exercising Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated before the Old Bailey Court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "beautiful special adviser."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby's voice box and "stand constantly in front of his door," but Coulson also called him and left him voice messages.
"The charge suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's house hoping to surprise them, it's the kind of man to like to introduce the story to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He stated that NotW used three ways to investigate issues: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about phone piracy?
He says otherwise, but we say "Of course it is."
The rumors about a link involving Clarke were first picked up by the editorial office of NotW when a source, having a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that they had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which voice messages were recorded hacked on its phone at least three times, was seized at the Mulcaire home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer that concerned Miss Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Miss Pawlby's minor actions and actions.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow which I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as the former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a connection with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defense Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to doing telephone piracy.
Barack Obama receives the Iraqi Prime Minister, in the throttle of violence
The President of the United States was to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, in search of US assistance to combat the greatest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its most deadly month in October in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday, 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations presents an even higher balance sheet with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violences are increasingly deadly despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the U.S. troops were withdrawn, the level of violence made a new hugging fear while neighbouring Syria was in danger of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funerals.
Men are killed in the streets or even at home, and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and of being the target of unjust arrests, has favored this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, after the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated to Al-Qaida (sunistic extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nuri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the centre of the talks in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki who will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival Wednesday in Washington, Nuri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the Congress elected.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to lead a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nuri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sector and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded Barack Obama to make Nuri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses a Uighour group of Tiananmen's attack
The Chinese Homeland Security Chief accused a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists on Friday of being behind the attack on the trapped car that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, sank into the crowd that was on the famous place of the Chinese capital, symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passersby.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Office for Homeland Security, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkestan as the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province the East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that are fuelled by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing has been organized and premedied," Meng said to the Hong Kong channel Phoenix TV.
"The group behind them was the Islamic movement of the East Turkestan," he added, as the new Chinese agency had said.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is of Uighour origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained gasoline-filled containers and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican investigates contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major worldwide survey of how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and couples formed from the same sex.
The survey asked participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the ties of marriage.
The survey was sent to each national conference of bishops in mid-October, with the aim of getting as many responses as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesman for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how to sound the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the Internet survey by asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: The Army attacks the last fief of the rebels
The irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred combatants, were almost 2000 metres high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jumba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the Province of North Kivu.
"It has not ceased since this morning, the fights continue despite the night," told the AFP a resident of Jumba, attached by telephone around 12:30, and according to which a girl was wounded by ball in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased somewhat," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have somewhat repelled the rebels."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jumba before going up to the front for a "ratising operation".
It was very clearly heard behind it of small arms-fed developments.
From Bunagana, political fief and the last strong place of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, a PSA journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source to the United Nations Stabilization Mission of the DRC, the fights entered "in a final phase", the FARDCs "enclosed the positions of the residual M23 to delegate them".
Since the resumed Friday, clashes between the March 23rd Movement (M23) and the army, the Monusco has not been directly involved in the fighting, but it provides critical support to government troops in the area of intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied in ammunition, were riding towards the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, borderline with Uganda, civilian-assisted soldiers carried a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC fire truck, to ensure the rise of another M23 landing gear on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila, again called on Wednesday evening the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize themselves" under the penalty of being disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December with no result for the moment.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, only at Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed on the government side.
The M23 was born of a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, essentially Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which are rebutted by Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where approximately 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the movement of return to the DRC which had been set in motion in the morning reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we crossed to go to our fields, but the military told us to repel us," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including a baby on his back.
It seems that fire strikes are approaching populations.
Early in the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the singing and dancing productions take their turn.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical affirms itself as a genre of success.
Long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts would stop in the ridiculous.
And successes like Cabaret or the Miserables carried the aureole of the mystery.
Jean-Luc Choplin's arrival at Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes handle titles as successful tubes.
The first resume, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" could well be one of the success of the season.
On the other scenes, musical performances like "1789", "the Bastille lovers" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" become more than success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of musical comedies" and lecturer at Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for success so hard conquered.
How are French musical comedies evolving?
The offer has multiplied.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve to the benefit of producers...
Some use beautiful pictures and a true story as in 1789, the lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year back bond on the pretext that we can serve almost anything when we have Matt Pokora in the head of the poster.
After that, we have musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Chatelet that bring us back to life the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
The independent French producers are trying a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects like "Rent", "Le Baiser de la femme spiderée" or "L'Eveil du spring" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough able artists like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it is a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musical comedy, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
Jobs are numerous among regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The living of talent is as important as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
A few theatres start on tour and are often from boulevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
Music shows fill that gap.
These are the same young people who love telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of a lust of these girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are often held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a province's Zenith.
Mayonnaise is mounted in Paris and disgusted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver in the ring of Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning around 5:30, on the inner ring of Brussels up to Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is free of charge.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 at the scene of the accident, when the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause little bottlenecks because the accident took place at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore be diverted by this output/entry of the ring.
A child severely injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was severely injured following an attack on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is always hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" attraction.
It was closed to new order.
DRC: The Army Prepares a New Assault
Children play on a carbonized shield that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the last of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The objective is to delocate the M23 of the hills that overlook Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from itself.
It will remain only the hill of Runyonyi.
"Chanzu is not very strategic," said North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku to the PSA.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last strong place of rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, some hundreds of M23 irreducibles have been cut off at nearly 2,000 metres above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and nearby Jumba
In Jumba, a resident who had reported close combat on Thursday throughout the day said that the situation was "calm since this morning."
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the previous fighting and were buried.
A girl was shot, and three others were injured, including one grave injury, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of FARDC-Re rebel fighting on 25 October, the two belligerents have given no balance of human life losses.
NSA's revelations increase business paranoia with respect to state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the capital of Germany.
At the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of hearing aids and that the transaction sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of Intelligence, again stressed in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "store the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant became a denouncer, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on his word.
Reports, according to which the U.S. National Security Agency has espioned the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has had access to data held by U.S. suppliers of storage services in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever caused the paranoia of companies with regard to state surveillance.
The revelation that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vase to overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing German IT SMEs.
German companies believe that the United States is as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the EY consulting firm.
However, in all the documents provided by Mr Snowden, there is no evidence to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A Member of the German Parliament said we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly...
"This is not the right way to do it," said Hasso Plattner, president of the German company of software companies, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the extent and sophistication of American espionage agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations have been a shock to some companies who until then thought that China represented the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that the data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a Cloud Security Alliance survey, a professional organization, about 10% of non-American members renounced their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after disclosures on the US Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: "Our clients are asking us today a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data kept and can you guarantee me that they will stay physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already know, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been one.
"It has been a recurring subject for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, director general of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business leaders are generally not inclined to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, if that would leave the advantage to an adversary.
Large companies have long battled the message that it is at least unwise to recover a free USB key at a professional salon or leave a mobile computer without supervision in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi car manufacturer, states that the collection of mobile phones prior to board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones prepaid on their travel abroad due to the risk of achieving the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorized access," warned BfV in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to other countries' economic espionage activities.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty to the second degree of committing acts of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company thought that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former French Internal Intelligence Director, D.C.I.R., said in an interview this month: "Services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a treadmill in the gymnasium of his high school, believe that their son was murdered, said family lawyer Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found in a tapestries standing behind the gymnasium of his high school on 11 January.
Investigators of the sheriff of the County of Lowndes concluded that Johnson had died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family objected to these conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son has been murdered," said Benjamin Crump, counsel representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's findings.
"They think that this challenges all logic, the laws of physics and common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered solely for the purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their sons to school with a poster and they were given it in a mortar bag," he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow through on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from "positional asphyxiation".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"A number of questions still merit an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates elements to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The sheriff's office representative in Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to deliver all video surveillance records that the investigators had examined.
Teenager parents said they hoped that video images contained clues about the circumstances of her death.
CDC publishes guidance on children's allergies to schools
Wednesday, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage children's allergies in school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the US government publishes, since the number of children of school age with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States is now suffering from food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in the child had increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to treat them in case of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools have a epine stock – the self-injector brand EpiPen being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of States have recently updated the regulations to enable schools to have more easily epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something hits my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue" or "I have bites on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on intelligence
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand is publicly offensive by summoning the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other, by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on its board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when the Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a true discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks after the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence on the one hand, and on the other a condemnation of the hearings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't it be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but a search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil over US diplomacy's analysis of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of the American power, this is an important lighting.
When we describe American systems of interference against French diplomacy in the United States, this is in no way to make us unworthy of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information from the NSA about terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we look at American collaboration?
The establishment of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States over the last ten years, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States, in particular, have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of almost daily information, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, Mohammed Merah's presence in tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to US services, and, in return - we have already said - the Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the substantive question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to develop interception tools, that the question of the total lack of prior debate, particularly in Parliament, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and ultimately the issue of infringements of freedoms.
What are the real risks to the United States ? a deterioration of their image?
I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk run by the Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest summit of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have tended.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are striving, in the light of revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. providers subject to American laws, and thus to the grip of the NSA.
Last element: the vast movement of revelations committed by media from around the world, which helps to trigger a debate on the practices of surveillance of intelligence services up to now almost non-existent, could lead legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Intersex parents can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female gender of the newborns will no longer be attributed rigidly to birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child's sex, allowing them to register a "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on his or her birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
According to BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors have created, concussioned and scrambled.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexed, intersexity as part of the group of 60 diagnosed diseases such as disorders of sexual development, a generic term referring to persons possessing atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersected.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best information available to attribute it, then wait for and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and sexual identification specialist, said the new German law "seemed to be a good idea."
Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very specific.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sex organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudiced crimes.
Young boys of non-conformity now have camps that are specially destined for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to write male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial that allows her to keep a "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators in this land have signed a petition for the “generic theory” to be removed from school books.
The American site Catholic Online also opposed the German law, writing that "because the world is dragged into a new kingdom where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are thrown down."
In Maryland, a baby's mother also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at their birth.
"The role of a parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And just over a decade ago, the medical community regarded the type as a slate, which can be erased and on which we can redefine.
But now, many people challenge the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can cheat, not knowing how a child will feel about sexual reassignment as he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender to be malleable.
He used the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/John", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a broken circumcision to have him castrated entirely, also removing the testicles, and raising him as a daughter.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he returned to a boy and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors "always repeat this model."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations said "[they] are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer, who was born with XY male chromosomes but with ambiguous sexual organs.
The doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a daughter.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
When he was 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something wasn't going, he asked for his medical file.
What he discovered he horrified.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body from producing sufficient testosterone so that his sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a treatment with testosterone and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex persons.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director-general of the non-profit organization based in California Lawyers for Reported Choice, fears that German law "invites labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an "indeterminate" sex," she said.
We are afraid it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal type," she added.
The German law concerns the attribution of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should carry out at that age.
When they grow, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law will "responsive" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete insensitivity syndrome for androgens.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, at the age of 29, Katie is married and intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or wearing mothers.
"The law leaves a certain latitude for parents so they do not have to make early decisions," Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and to understand them, and a time before registering "male" or "female".
So everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You don't have to rush for surgery that's irreversible.
"It puts children at the heart of the decision and eases the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what is right," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and that's a wonderful thing.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta believes that his Government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and the right in the ruling coalition at the approach of the Senate's vote to disprove Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In a daily interview with La Stampa, the left centre leader says he has "firmly intended" to continue to rule with his coalition until the next legislative elections of 2015.
The High Chamber of the Italian Parliament will meet within the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where it counts more opponents than supporters, is deposed.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October last year by his refusal to give injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of fireshots.
Firefighters called at the scene of the drama claimed to have responded to a call for "injured multiples".
"The forces of order are on site," the airport said on its Twitter account, while TV images showed people evacuated to ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesperson from the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told the AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a bench, and a second one was transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9h30 locals (12h30 in Montreal) at terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
Los Angeles Times states that 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights to and from the airport have been suspended.
The Israeli army kills a Hamas member in Gaza-sces
On Thursday, Israeli tanks killed an Islamic Palestinian militant from Hamas and severely injured another one in the south of the Gaza Strip, following sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in this region, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Hebrew State, crossed the border and the discovery of which was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to be dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors have, in the greatest secret, considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most notable event in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday evening that the president's close collaborators had carried out "depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's avoidance could help Obama for his re-election while his hopes were diminished.
According to the policy officer of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign officials and the White House, namely the former Secretary-General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure the effect of replacing the Vice-President with the former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the ballot.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been kept in Chicago's campaign GQ and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisors from the president – including Daley, the former campaign leader of Obama Jim Messina and the former White House advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under consideration.
"Dual Down" indicates that Daley carried the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal links", before finally deciding against change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "does not significantly improve Obama's chances of success".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and it was one of them," Daley said in the paper.
Remember, at that time, the president was not in shape, and so it was said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley was calling the "co-op" review, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would benefit from the vote.
"The campaigns do not devote much money to polls and discussion groups unless they seriously plan to take action," said Martin on AC360.
However, we do not know whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of the possible rescheduling.
Although Daley said he did not think the president "was aware" of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "double Down" did not finally answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's avoidance of the presidential list was being examined.
"Perhaps," said Martin.
Do you want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a light snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on the jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more we lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice society "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said: "It's amazing but we're still only at the beginnings in terms of production, and 2 g of this stuff costs about 200 pounds."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the pH-neutral language.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because the luminescence of the jellyfish is worth four times as much as gold.
So each ball costs me about £ 140.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimenting company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added, "I really want to develop an invisible ice."
It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while performing tai chi exercises, revealed on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and destined for the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands of musicians that broke the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a Tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband the week before her death to take her out of the hospital and take her to their Springs house (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last few years.
And even if we are citizens, it is our spiritual house.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the wonderful joy of living he had," she added.
Lou Reed had undergone a liver graft last May.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more penniless.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed a single candy and I'm certainly not going to do it again this year.
But the states show that I'm the Welsh sheep when we talk about Halloween.
Most Americans – 158 million in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 million in candy, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is the trend.
The disguises are expected to represent $1.2 million out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the men in the Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million in animal disguises this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, it's not glamorized.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9 million in candy this year, according to firm Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucettes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a great news for the 41 million kids who go to the candy hunt in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, we're not telling stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Maize candy is the only thing we don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Manufacturers Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't come to elucidate yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted homes in the United States, which generate about $500 million revenue, according to America Haunts, and this includes these amazing pictures of you pissing on your friends on Facebook and you can't remove and on which a guy you like leaves a comment of the "beautiful head" style.
Finally, let's talk about citrouli.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped cylinder, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby citrouille" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these potions and didn't have to sit in.
This year, the Americans will spend approximately $106 million on citrus fruits, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The windshields that cool down on the porch of your house were probably coming from Illinois, where 542 million citrus fruits were grown this year.
If you're looking to make more remark, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg tank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal failure structure (bad bank) comprising 38 billion pounds (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and speed up its re-renewal.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of questionable assets in its balance sheet in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned up the balance sheet within three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for depreciation of additional doubtful claims of four to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonation structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thus strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would draw a line over the past, the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the United Kingdom," said Director General Ross McEwan in the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallys
The interior has six-point flat seats and six-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
The options include improved brakes, service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler, Chief Executive Officer of Bowler Motorsport said: "The rallyers who join Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are truly pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rallying in the United Kingdom and international, and to prepare for the rigours and the realities of the raids.
We have had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship will be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North and Middle East Africa.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost dog after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornich in a career
Ruby, a cocker spaghetti, had escaped from a road accident without gravity
She was identified three days later by a person who walked her dog stuck in the career
Firefighters came down in memory along the cliff to recover the dog and save it from a certain death.
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to recover it safely while it was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable skirt of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month cocker Spaniard, escaped after an accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for only three days before being saved in a Wednesday career.
His owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked West Yorkshire's Fire and Relief Service.
They desperately sought their lost dog and launched a call on social media sites after she disappeared into the career after an accident without gravity.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-looking person who walked his dog spotted Ruby on a corniche in the career, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton's firehouse rolled up on the site and came down in recall to save Ruby using an animal civier to carry it up to the top of the cliff.
Andy Clayton said, "She was in a precarious situation."
She was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She didn't move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical Relief Specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky to get away with it."
She could have been badly hurt or worse.
Ruby was conducted in the veterinarian for control; its general condition was satisfactory, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified by watching the rescue."
I didn't believe she was up there at first.
It was amazing to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were fearsome.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely formidable.
Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid she would fall, but she didn't move."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dragged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, pop star said she was a cheerleader on Jagger's "Old Habits Die Hard" song in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "he dragged me when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he "defeatedly denied having made advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed at the top of the charters this week.
Beijing challenges a Turkmen Islamic Movement
"The support behind the attack came from the Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkestan based in Central and Western Asia," said China's security body boss on a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), spoke in Tashkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese official designates a particular organization after the Monday attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs of the same family of the Xinjiang Muslim-dominating region, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with fuel canons against the entry of the forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that caused two deaths and 40 injuries.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, who claims to fight for the independence of East Turkestan, former Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated to Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Europe's Explosion Gives the Scottish Choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Trade Area in order to join the EU.
And that's what we hear about passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along Hadrian's wall.
While it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper has indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the large (and expected) titles.
No one has said that the EU Member States spend much of their time bypassing their formal rules when it arranges them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continuing non-compliance with the rules would be a minor concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from Scotland.
So this is a story that is not one.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: I first heard the bobard that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
However, an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why trade London's yoke against Brussels, in particular now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely dead.
With the crisis of the euro, Project Europe is officially dead.
Through Europe, parties opposing the EU or militating for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency gain the ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Euroseptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the September federal elections and left the Democratic Liberal Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the burden on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments that have excessive budgetary deficits – this is only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has weighed on its members the exchange rates favourable to German exporters – what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe encounter an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper discomfort related to productivity in Europe.
Following the 'green' energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subsidizing the French and German companies in the energy sector at the cost of the consumer – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-effective drawback, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Every wage freeze in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt rages, particularly in France, one of the EU's major drivers.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy failing to move.
As a result: Marine Le Pen's extreme right-wing party, the Anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, bringing the socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it can't start from the principle that a split on the right will automatically promote the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use the next year's European elections to create a single anti-Money bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are a good figure in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-monnaie feeling in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like the free "Europe of Nations (Sovereign)" favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and South Europe will regain their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope it will look gentle in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a small England region (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could agree on a more free European agreement, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-Federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and it is worth noting – the political anti-austerity movement that was the best success in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts (and implementation) proposed by the Chancellor of the Labour Equiquire, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democratic coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Ageing Earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
CNN's former correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's boobs and pups are starting to grow to 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-enocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as the burgeoning of the breasts, the hairs under the arms and in the pubic area and the body smells, appear earlier among the girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, while the average age is 12 and three-quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster development may justify endocrinologist tests to avoid serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the emergence of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of bones that can slow growth and a small size in adulthood.
The recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but acknowledges that "the fact of controlling puberty can mitigate certain behavioural problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others."
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules at the age of 10.
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from the frightened and upset school to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's attention on the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages transmitted by the media are responsible.
The boys, like the girls, reach their puberty sooner.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study on girls aged 6-9 years, which links the percentage of fat mass to the release of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are several explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms appear to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hairs on their face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards real early puberty is not as pronounced as among girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a Pedo-Endocrinologist working in the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatricians on how to talk to their children.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that, even when it happens sooner than anticipated, the process is part of life.
The tribute to Brother Coen's folk
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that started to resonate there, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography had just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Film Festival, had added the Palme d'or in Cannes in 1991 to Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the Peter trio, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their return on the American film star, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the pop planetary star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and live-interpreted songs, Oscar Isaac turns out to be a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a joyful contagion.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich attractions of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less shiny clothes, a sweet voice when she sings, but the jury owed to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about one week the troubles of a folk singer who can't go through and get mad with the whole earth.
He accepts standing replacements from the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive it.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success was tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mix of malchance, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not a career, but integrated, with self-destructive behaviour," said Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prices in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis didn't exist, the two folk music filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the day like the folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this New York district called to become "the epicenter of the development of folk music that would generate international stars" as written by journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes all the documentary, from the label of dusty music invaded by 33T, inhabited by an impassable old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers were.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character who passes through the film permanently: a magnificent red cat with a cracking look, companion of fortune from Llewyn Davis.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "large in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered as good", "a chance can also launch someone's career," and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get stuck by everything that can stop us from expressing."
Gérard de Villiers, author of "SAS", is dead.
He'll never have known the word retreat.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had dedicated him to "the author of espionage novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, a theatre of 198 and 199 opus of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he moved on this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he also traveled to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Surely between 120 and 150 million all countries confused", he advanced last March.
His Burmese cat on the knees, in the living room of his immense apartment of a Foch Avenue building just a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, the Malicious Eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, drawing a pile of books on the low table between the bronzes or ivores reported from the 130 Arpent countries to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman to the advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his most serene highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, aristocrat of the U.S.A. and contract officer to pay for the repairs of the family castle, launches to the packages of all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 90s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literary author," Gérard de Villiers explained.
I see myself as a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I don't send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, Albert London, who went on the spot and came back with real and long investigations."
SAS' father said to "make a kind of geopolitical sheeton."
"I am always my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, people of the services I have known for some twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitional: so, a month before the attack of a Syrian regime command centre having killed several high officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret command centre of the CIA in this city, cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Plot of Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on the capital of Mali.
I am not guessing, was defending Gerard de Villiers, I just make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realized.
After these travels in often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his machine to write IBM at marguerite dating from 1976 "of which all the pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords are hung on the walls of his office.
Regularly pushed for machismo by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dropped these charges in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am still very welcome in Africa where I count many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He will not die and not retire.
No more than me.
Airplanes are complaining about the width of seats while large orders are at stake
The dispute rages between the large aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the tourist class's seats on long-distance flights, opening the way for a bitter confrontation during the Dubai air show that takes place this month.
The conflict concerns the width of the proposed seats on long-rail flights to passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most shortened by airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but his great American rival Boeing said it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the aircraft sought to sell even larger versions of their long-wing bimotor aircraft, possibly hoping for a record of orders during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which seats will be positioned at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its revised "777X" will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats of more than 17 inches wide, and will be set up with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch seats in rows of 9.
Aeronautic giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai air show, where 777X should take a step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were able to realize recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financials of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Will you accept that?".
"Boeing offers long-distance flights in more narrower seats than in regional turbo-propeller planes," said John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
As food habits change, people grow, but seats on planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Jumbo 747 of Boeing defined the modern long-distance journey, and the turn of the century, the average American weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American-size tower of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival clings to a concept of seat dating from the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly baptized jet set was narrower.
Airbus adds that she has commissioned a study that indicates that an additional inch at seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures with regard to the width of seats and asserts that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also said that the study showed that cabin experience did not depend only on the width of seats.
"It's really about bringing flexibility to airlines and enabling them to do what they think they need to do in order to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute there is a flight order race of at least $700 million at market prices in the coming decades, sufficient to weigh the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the configuration of seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a yield per seat in their latest models of long-corrier bimotors 20 per cent higher than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 model of origin configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this to be able to cash more seats and make its planes more competitive by reporting to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins set up with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a denser configuration, which can go even with cheaper rates.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the 777 threat," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines must choose.
The aircraft vendors who tour the world even take one metre with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable appliances, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers a configured A350 with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering larger side-by-side seats on some of his planes.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern appliances, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aircraft industry to set up a standard of size for the seats ends, but that he could make the sales wave of 777X forgotten.
Oracle shareholders irritate by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted on Thursday against the compensation proposal for the founder and director general Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but comes to tarnish the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just released from the victory of his ship at the Cup of America.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had received a negative vote on his remuneration.
The Oracle boss renounced a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group's poor performance, which failed to achieve its growth goals, but earned approximately $77 million from stock-options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire 2013 fiscal year, the net profit of Oracle has increased by 3.5% while the course of the scholarship of 27.5%, overperforming the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotin vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Other tests are needed before testing on human beings begins, but Professor Ronald Crystal of New York's Weill Cornell Medical College said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies trace all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having his dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the newly vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But mice who had not been vaccinated "were pacified," said researchers, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
Experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently so that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms the liver cells into antibodies plants.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But he's more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will take no pleasure in the anti-nicotin vaccine, and that will help them to lose their bad habits," he added.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but reported that much more thorough research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban chief killed by a drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an American drone hit on Friday in Pakistan, and was taught to security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officers, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, which was carried out in the North-Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
The previous day, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, informed the British government that discussions had taken place with Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi refuses to be influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripody will be the subject of an investigation by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
Former South Wales Minister Joe Tripody denied changing the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three assets located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to see whether Mr.Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew its leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiration in August 2005, without any calls for offers.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripody was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of former Assistant Secretary General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressured the leases to be the subject of an invitation to tender.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for the companies of Circular Quay, which reported to the Obeids approximately $2.5 million per year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of calls for tenders.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who recognized Mr. Tripodi as demanding a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the CICA showed calls from Mr.Obeid, Mr. Tripody and Steve Dunn, who had arrived at the Ports department after working under the orders of Mr.Obeid at the Fisheries Department.
"Was the topic discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed, but in any case, that wasn't it.
In any case, certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, says one responsible
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday evening, confirming a military officer at Fox News.
The manager did not specify the target, but said there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reported that the target was Russian-made missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried on air strikes against missile shipments to Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 may have to pass a "authenticity" test
The government is currently exploring the possibility of setting up a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 while considering extending the measures of repression.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent visas 457 from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a means of diverting his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government discourse on foreign workers, saying that it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The failed statements on "foreigners returning to the end of the line" and "jobs for the Australians first" are an unpleasant return at the time when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites had to be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The working paper reports on the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are being examined.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for "if the job offer is genuine in the case the applicant is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or the person concerned within the undertaking sponsoring it".
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The grown-up son of a man, aged 9, went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death Wednesday to an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as Phase 1 is opened in 2026.
Baron Transport Minister Kramer said the project "would bring together the United Kingdom."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown called himself "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will feature a new high-speed railway between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 Md to £42.6 Md.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of travel duration for the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
Baron Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a capacity problem of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them can be improved through HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the global high-speed rail network project across Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government to examine options for bringing the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then we will decide together the next steps."
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain for the time being in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the US gesture to ease regulation on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their electronic books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers examine the decision that obliges U.S. carriers to do important work in order to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft on aircraft," she said.
The issue is subject to a regulation requiring aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety on a permanent basis and passengers to comply with safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who had already told CASA of her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve customer experience now that we have (from the Wi-Fi technology-based entertainment system) on our planes," said a spokesman.
Qantas stated that she respected the current rules for the moment.
"According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine the FAA decision and the reasons for this.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing manuals, training equipment, hand luggage transport programs and instructions provided to passengers.
"As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will require passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier devices be safely placed under seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in a violent fight
The small town of Pia has experienced an unusual excess fever Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crash of about 30 people according to the evidence gathered...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a row involving several people broke out on the side of the Poste.
At least four slight injuries would be grieving.
Warnings, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and to ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore gage lenders take advantage of the middle classes forced to tighten their belts
In one of Bendemeer's shopping malls in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga holds a bracelet, ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay the tuition fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went out in there," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in some parts of South-East Asia – where household debt increases – that ValueMax, where it has made its transaction, has become the third loan company to be introduced to the Singapore stock exchange this week.
Making jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms.Amirthalinga – but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore-based lenders take an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same commercial centre.
However, bank lenders have the advantage of not applying for a solvency check or proof of salary, and can release loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to lenders on payroll while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and over-indebtting of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by an overly lax monetary policy in the advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to lenders to bridge the gap while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited household debt, mainly due to higher mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest ratio of household debt/gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists are also afraid of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which recently came out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing drop in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [wage scale] are trying to supplement their incomes as they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have led people to hurry to get their personal effects in order to reach the cash value of their jewels.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items in the 200 state-run loan stores are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's get the chain of granny gold and we'll come back looking for it next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney's largest retail store operator, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using his shops over the past few months.
The increase is such in the loan-to-gag sector that ValueMax, the shop operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops such as this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside of Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, his general director.
The company will finance them by using 60% of Singapore's 66 million dollars this week when it is introduced to the Singapore stock exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have removed criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates they are practicing, Ms. Yeah indicates that the wagering not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetaryizing their personal property does not increase household debt," she said.
Employment is becoming more socially acceptable as a means of obtaining short-term guaranteed funding.
The people who go to the lenders on payroll are also not only those who have financial problems.
People in Singapore also go to the valuedMax loan stores for gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of society.
"It may be wealthy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses that need cash to go through a difficult direction," added Miss Yeah.
Sometimes, they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for young people in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was in charge, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a press release, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it should not communicate with people under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He gets in Nazi uniform at the supermarket, before being driven away
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform covered by a brassard with the gammed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the facility that called the police, said the store Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to rescue, but "the time it arrived, it was already gone without slavery," she added.
I was tailing when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were a good mouth.
"You don't get out on the street unless you want to draw attention," said a 60-year-old client, Rosina Rusin, at Cambridge News.
This incident took place on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to dress in monsters, but it was difficult to know whether it was a canal.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS brassard twice a week at Asda for three years," said Paul Dutton, explaining to suffer from "mental problems".
Saving plan of $325 million for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the wavering health system has strict conditions to ensure that the government will not waste the funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Pibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "emergency measures" to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The four-year-old funding was decided upon after government consultations with the Independent Parliamentary Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," said Plubersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgery.
Additional 2 600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up with the delay.
Funding is also provided for non-scheduled clinics in Hobart and Launceston, with better external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to first-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat the Tasmanian health system," said Plubersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to maintain current funding levels to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be formed to ensure that the State provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for a great deal "unless they are followed by genuine reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system."
However, he congratulated the Government on having responded to the urgent request for assistance from the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But the Spokesperson of the Health Opposition Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "lucky Solution".
"The reason we are here is that the state's Labour Government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government of the state that takes up nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth puts $300 million, and claims it's a rough day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Pibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent in additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstitution of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Taking place in France from the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent in a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she confronts the cruelty without a boundless Mother's willfully sadistic and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film is never seen in lubrity or sensationalism, and that is the problem.
The conscious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, reports the monitoring body
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gases, said the international chemical weapons monitoring agency Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIC) came with a day in advance on the deadline of the
November 1 established by the organization based in The Hague ordering Damascus to destroy or "make it unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitious calendar to destroy Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has approximately 1,000 tons of chemicals and chemical weapons, including mustard gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged Thursday in the city of Safira which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights based in Britain.
The group of activists, following the evolution of the human balance sheet through a network of activists based in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6, 365 children.
On the Government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad were killed, 1878 of whom were fighters of the pro-government forces and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Of the deaths, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and about 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom are linked to groups of the Al-Qaeda network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but it did not give any clarification.
The fighting emphasized the importance of the dangers faced by chemical-weapon inspectors as they must complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a lasting civil war, within a tight time frame.
A statement by the OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all critical production and machinery for mixing and filling."
She added that "no other inspection activity is currently planned."
Earlier in the week, the inspectors reported that they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites, according to Syria, were "abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, civil war mainly opposed Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of el-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alaouite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
The anger caused by the sentence against one of Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the attacks in Bali in 2002 reacted angrily against the last conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years fleeing as one of Asia's most sought-after men in the south-east, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the bombings.
He could be released after 15 years under parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass killings for attacks targeting two nightclubs in the Kuta People's Tourism District, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also found guilty of many other charges relating to terrorism, including a wave of attacks targeting churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors requested a life imprisonment sentence, but they could have asked that the man, qualified as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On board the tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"It should be held in front of the execution platoon," said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without any other grandchildren, or see my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 23 hours on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze blew up a back bag loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He soaked in the coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he died three times while he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues stated that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – which were executed 4 years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the U.S. forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Ousama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Ben Laden in order to reestablish links between the South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't go," said Corteen.
Until recently, he was mocking himself the sorrow he could have caused to others.
The verdict was made on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year," said Ms. Corteen.
Patek may, however, appeal his sentence.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not make a phone call)
Air airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronics to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk about their mobile phone – under the new highly anticipated guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from one airline to another, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air airlines will have to prove to FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and have updated the training manuals for crew members and the rules for the storage of aircraft to be in conformity.
FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," said the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to light them before the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives it a green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft at the plane's descent before landing and do not turn them off until the aircraft has settled down.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, said the FAA.
Most of the new line aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Waiting, said he was happy about these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we are going to work closely with the carriers for it – it will benefit everyone," explained Glading in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "roomkeepers" when it comes to this question.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft in airplane mode.
So still not Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was kicked out loudly from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be arranged because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA may remove the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, National Transportation Safety Expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered to be at risk.
"Portable phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile telephone relays if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
An industrial advisory committee established by FAA to address the problem recommended last month that the government allow more use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has increased in recent years to ease the restrictions on their use.
Attractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, claim that there is no valid safety reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 as a result of reports on interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were transporting FM radios, the high-tech gadget of time.
New-line aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of online aircraft are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
eBook readers, for example, only emit minimum transmissions when turning one page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who pressure to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders loaded a line plane of readers of Kindle eBooks and made it fly to see if there were any problems, but there was none.
This inspired the members of the FAA Advisory Committee on mixed feelings about whether or not the use of equipment presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines said he thought interferences from devices were real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow pilots to request passengers to turn off their devices during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them sensible arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A heliterated bird of a North Sea platform was released in nature
A bird, helicured after being found exhausted on a oil platform in the North Sea, was released in nature.
The water stream was mounted on board a helicopter towards Aberdeen last month before it was set up by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue centre.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This stream of water was probably a wintering migrator who came from northern Europe and found himself in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added, "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water stream was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring together businesses and to define what wealth and jobs creators want to change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive investigation with British business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, who are generally representative of all business sizes, sectors and regions in Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now seeking exportation outside Europe, focusing on countries that modernise and develop while the EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to get involved in the long and hard process of reforming the European institutional arenas.
When asked for their advice on specific political issues – ranging from monopolies regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate compared to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40% of the large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European, are even in agreement.
Finally, and more importantly, our investigation with business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based EU relationship rather than politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a "significant change" that restores power in the United Kingdom.
The issues are high – reaching to change the Treaty and better represent the interests of Britain would allow 16% of the votes to be raised in favour of maintaining the country in the EU at a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a single moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is committed to closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, for companies this means once again putting the emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
The United States with Halloween colours
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he distributed friandias to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, the Halloween festivals on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the crossing of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the parties caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the district of "Greenwich village".
Everyone is overexcited, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.

Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the director of Gazprom.
"A historic event took place today: The construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, Europe's most important large-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, the Director General of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream should allow Russia's export routes to Europe to be diversified.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, the country in which most of the Russian gas is transferred to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is implemented in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
Pitcairn Island wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced on Thursday the newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Poland), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, with three other small islands close to it.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutiny of the Bounty, an episode of the history of the English Navy, which gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly of the mutiny descendants of the Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on 95% of London's generosity.
The Island Council unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, i.e. 836,000 km2 that correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy to the island mayor went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, who lives in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanction the 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive air and sea surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEZ, near Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice governor
A former deputy governor of the province of Jilin in north-eastern China was sentenced to death for corruption on Friday.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having touched more than 19 million yuan of pot-wine, reports Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first intermediate court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State has promised that justice would be as intrusible with the powerful "tricks" as with the "moches" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been condemned, including former executives of the Petrochina oil giant.
The most recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having focused on the highest positions in the state.
However, the government has shown no intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA in New South Wales were accused of sexual assault against children following allegations against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization."
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was accused of child pornography offences and a physical education monitor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsellor to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second one.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate, underlining, "external controls of YMCA have been carried out and indicated that children's safety was a top priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst reviews on four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities held in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure to recruit Lord and failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings in children's safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with children, that he was keeping them in private, making them sit on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was run by Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about her behaviour, said that she was in charge of child services at YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, which would be "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director General said he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their superior.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord were clouding their judgment, which made them not report their actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his view before the board of the YMCA of New South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson from "the Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "the reporting" by the staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have confidential agreements signed to staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by the YMCA Director-General for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University in front of the Commission.
He indicated that there were "severe problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but he acknowledged that his return was unlikely.
In an interview the last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old man expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments on foreign affairs and his role as special envoy to the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to Prime Minister's position, Mr Blair would have answered, according to London's Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it may happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian events met in Cardiff to confront and win the horse trophy of the year, they knew that the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet in school and only a few months after having made his first weapons, the baby and his Shetland Toffee pony trouted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparables – of the same size – were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank equestrian center, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Introducing himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side in a casual way to parade his 2-year-old ponie Toffee around the track.
Fenton was greeted by judges for his unusual natural dress qualities for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd anniversary last March and trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffee are doing a great duo."
They showed up towards and against all, but both of them increased the golden cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the tracks of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been taking part in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
"There was electricity in the air, and everyone was encouraging it and applauding it."
He walked through the length of the running track and even if he seemed to be quite small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares for.
From the way he began, he will probably soon participate in the celebration of the Year's Horse – and I am sure he will make a good performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to run his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well present and how they paraded on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud of it.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be forwarded"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be amended, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted to television that he had accepted wine pots to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo "complete remediation," the regulator said.
The order of "removal" comes from Guangdon administration for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the company listed Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's writing was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete renovation of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation of the people responsible at New Express and immediately retain the journal's management team."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction engineer named Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a first-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on a public television channel where he admitted he had published false stories against money.
"In this case, I hurt Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express issued his apology on the front page, writing that he did not properly verify his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made television aves.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to make confessions, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to commit himself.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in a hurry.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of Charles de Gaulle's two nuclear heaters, in mid-October and while the boat was at sea, was "safe for the marines", but it was not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DCNS, a defence naval specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, deployed in the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the faulty heater.
"All is implemented so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can carry out its planned deployment at the end of 2013," says DCNS.
And the National Navy to certify that "this does not call into question the ship's activity programme" at nuclear propulsion.
We recall that the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier is leaving a six-month interim maintenance period.
He had crafted from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "small damage", circumscribed to the containment space of the reactor, had occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great deal of dissatisfaction with the people I meet: monstrous re-evaluation of their properties, a flood of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to be stopped.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be spared in order to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken by force to taxpayers decreases their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no concern about sumptuous spending and maintenance of boisterous ducks: deficit cultural center, strong grant to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, whether they are sold to the private company or demolished.
It is also difficult to see the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honorable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost for tax payers?
It is not the public level to invest in such companies, but rather the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that lakes in the Fisheries and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water-consumers) and the high population decline, the use of water has declined considerably across the territory.
Not to mention waste disposal, the city will never lack water and the strict regulation on its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to realize great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by tie-ups with beautiful degrees for most, and I don't think a sheep raiser gets worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway track
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the four-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzavant on an equivalent length of nearly six long football pitches, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, USA.
The area is full of endless warehouses, making it easy to conceal drug-filled trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs were detected by going unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to judicial records.
Three men, according to the authorities, who worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison for life imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important crossing discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the collection of marijuana in central Mexico in October, thus challenging drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that started from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British Police issue an extradition mandate against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuador Embassy in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "report of surrender" against 40-year-old Australian, asking him to come to a police station, adding that if he did not do so, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated its appeal against extradition at the beginning of the month.
Concerned that Stockholm authorized its transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuador Embassy in London on 19 June, calling for political asylum in that South American country.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asked him to come to a police station at the time and time of his choice," said a spokesman.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the release of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after having unveiled more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How biometry invaded our lives
Finish the password to tap to access his smartphone or pay for his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even considers that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a world as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
The organizations dedicated to privacy confirm this desire for biometry, but worry about it.
Only in 2011 and France, the National Commission on Computer Science and Freedoms has authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of hand or the venous network of hand in businesses, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anywhere," justin Brookman, responsible for consumer privacy within the CDT, in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in each other, and pessimism, in others?
Biometry will be based on new technologies, which will enable new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours and the venous network of palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the field of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand, involve a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - we cannot capture this data on their own - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
As a result, research has been conducted for some twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to increased sensor accuracy and the computer computing capacity necessary for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, calculated Cyrille Bataller, Director of Accenture R&D Laboratories in Europe.
With our assistance, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we do research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," said Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
Unique and infalliable marker, DNA also arouses hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirmed Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC proposes to the judicial police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples in place of a crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometry are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensure that the person is the person she claims to be).
The identification concerned the issue of identity papers so far: the biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with the information that the state has on all citizens already set.
This makes it possible to ensure that a person does not attempt to exploit someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
"We retrieve images from surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities that move freely on the Internet," says Dany Nassif, in charge of commercial development at NEC France for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a picture of someone who tails in a store, follow their progression through facial recognition and calculate waiting time.
Authentication initially involved physical access (frontier, protected premises, canteens...) or logic (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control was added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the mate that points to another," explains Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But more and more authentication will also concern transactions, in particular those made from Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric player: this gesture replaces the secret code strike.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and major distribution: at the time of paying in store with its bank card, the client does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If successful, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Hints to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometry attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that she can make time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in cash thirty seconds less, it's appreciated," says the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer tailored options.
And finally, make sure that the precautions taken to protect databases are highlighted.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which is blocked if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin, from Thales.
But, without further study, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
The privacy specialists continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, made me fear the worst: a generalized surveillance," said Andrew Patrick, from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driving driver at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs was given a almond of £1,000.
A car driver was charged a fine of £1,000 for driving 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was found driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 to Braintree on 27 May.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At Colchester's Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from his permit led to a 6-month withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and a surcharge for £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow the London bubble
The Treasury provisionally accounted for the capital gains tax measure but expected a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, registered a 7% stamp right for properties that cost more than $2 million and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold properties within a company rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp right already applies to residential properties of the arrondissements of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 million over fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook stated: "As a result of the increase in the stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on this matter, it is very difficult to go forward that high-value properties are under-imposed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The prestigious real estate – the 5% to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector located in the south-west of London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record percentage of 11.8% in the last year.
Prices in central London show a steady growth of 5.6% in the year but have been eclipsed by a growing domestic market, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experiencing a recovery, according to the studies of Savils.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are related to its mood.
Previous studies have revealed that the happy dogs more moved their tails to the right (from the dog's point of view), while the nervous dogs moved it further to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "Everyone knows that in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that as well as in men, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disorderly tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies in which other dogs appeared.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We have presented to dogs films with other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion – and we were able to traffic the tail movement and present it as going more to the left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression stir the tail to the right (from the dog's point of view that removes the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they found a tail drifting mainly to the left (again from the dog's point of view that removes the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortiga said he did not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not be worried about.
He added: "If you meet other dogs several times and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their animals' emotions.
Canine behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a guest professor at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, explained that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that the dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a joyful dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when their tail swung to the left rather than to the right, rather than to become anxious - the opposite of what is in the Italian study."
He indicated that the differences could arise because dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully regard the animals of the films or the robots dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs might be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, recorded in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock band postponed a concert to Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed to its singer.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to take place Friday in The Hydro concert hall in downtown.
However, her laryngitis forced the singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, Arctic Monkeys stated: "Following the decision to defer the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also report the show to the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1."
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets that it cannot happen in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will be held on November 20, and the performance at Glasgow Hydro will be held on November 21.
All the tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We wish to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the men of the highest church placed in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal was 80 years old, he could no longer participate in the election of a pope – this is thus a group of 120 "elector cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesperson of the Vatican, said that a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony at which bishops would be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as the Consistory.
"The Pope Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the consistory from February in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Voix catholics stated that by February, the number of cardinal electors will probably be reduced.
He stated that a pope in general appointed as many cardinals as it required for the number of cardinal electors to reach 120 and as many cardinals as he wanted over 80 years of age.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
For the time being, there is a sort of tendency to focus on Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the council of the cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to examine ways of reforming the church.
Previously, the Pope decided on his own.
"From now on, François chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "as far as possible" that François asked for advice from cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero said that the popes generally raised bishops from vast communities to the rank of cardinal, but that François was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he will appoint".
GM reminds some of its new pickups in the United States to fix the seat file
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado pickups and GMC Sierra 2014 to resolve a problem with manually tilting files, according to a statement by the American vehicle safety regulator Friday.
On some pickups, the front seats could present a defect at the tilt mechanism level.
As a result, records do not comply with the federal safety standards of vehicles with respect to head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups of the defect during the first fortnight of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to the owners due to the 16-day cessation of government activities, which slowed the growth in sales of vehicles in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, said GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 pickups Silverado and 16,503 pickups Sierra.
GM's share course climbed by 1.4% to $37.47 in the New York stock exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday afternoon, in Montreal.
The drama took place around 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, close to the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the roundabout of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been carried out in this area for some time.
A mythical foundation wall has just been built over the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived on the site to recover her tools.
I was driving by and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the building.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We only saw part of his back, it's so sad.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his 50 ’ s who worked for a cast.
Resuscitation maneuvers have been attempted by emergency services, but with no success.
The man has not survived his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Labour Safety and Health Commission was posted to the premises to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair from an Obama elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts through the obstruction of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a tragically sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the second year of medicine and restore hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memories of the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical records of my patients at night and I lay down, this book goes back to the time when the policies inspired millions of people and the speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory, and the presenters of news newspapers took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends cried with joy and my parents kept all the papers they found.
A young team of visionaries moved to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the transition period of Obama before taking office in 2008, he had 82% favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really took place in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama for great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, by the end of the "unseen and unknown" and the murder of Usama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after having repeatedly defended Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of the Americans, nor the prosecution of whistleblowers that reveal the government's evils.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the circumvention of public funding and the overrun of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says that the White House's efforts to reduce the media to silence are the "most aggressive... since the administration of Nixon."
And, more recently, she cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Clearly, the election function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as Newton's massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above appear to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and poorly refined alternative that did not appear to allow for determining its policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, who was elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that have been heard for so long.
However, as the positive index of opinions plunged under 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses to the benefit of Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primaires.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
Here we are five years later, Mr President, and I am no longer in agreement with you.
The points of view expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, about 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Retinne Street in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing helmets.
Despite rapid relief intervention, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and enjoy this system.
The mining extract magnate, which contests the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, made this argument to try to rule out issues related to a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's girls were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of her daughters is pregnant, she will have a direct interest in whether she gets a leave or not," said Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of the Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of a renovation of the suffrage clearance system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is complete?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it in order to erase the result if someone doesn't agree?
Today, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed options for electronic voting and recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and that he would take on his new "very serious" functions.
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We do not seek reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of hardwood dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, Scientific Mission Officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Milieux (OCEAMM) returns to the Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of hard-working dolphin surprise you?
That's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
While in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographic basis today, the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge of species classification science.
It is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to challenge the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are challenged because of the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two species very close to morphologically were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
Ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific-based dolphins and the Atlantic-based whales.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this an important discovery as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and hence its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present at that place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we may have a case for extinction of a species, rather than for local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered by the number of existing individuals on Earth, i.e. stock, and the possibility of recovery from neighbouring stocks.
With regard to the species Sousa chinensis, the population of the new discovered species, its stock automatically became smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in open, homogeneous habitats in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brewing limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
We need to know that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than to know what lives in the Mariannes pit, just 11 kilometres from the sea surface.
More money is spent in the search for life on other planets than in marine research, and it is a long time that this changes.
RBS suspends two traders in the exchange market
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division on two sources close to the file, showing once again that the global survey of regulators on suspicions of manipulation of the foreign exchange market is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperated with regulators in the most important financial market investigations in the world, where US$ 5.3 billion change hands every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the broadening of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received requests for information from the regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and the other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had transmitted instant mail and messages files, sent to and from a former trader, the Financial Conduct Authority, to the UK regulator.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his post as European accountant trading manager for JPMorgan currencies.
Rohan Ramchandani, European accountant trading manager at Citi, was laid off this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, adding sources close to the folder.
UBS explained this week that she had attempted action against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said that she was investigating suspicions of manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examine allegations made about bankers who would have been heard to manipulate exchange market rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, and reported sources close to the file.
Banks use instant messages and emails that have been sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News about these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment banks trading units in recent years, but which has been challenged this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market for highly liquid changes, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms "declares that it is possible to start having a low-cost impact on the market".
The news came the same day that Crédit Suisse announced that it had returned a trader working in its London Stock Exchange fund office this week after it lost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been handled," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
The investigation on Mayor Rob Ford was blocked, supports a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen such an investigation.
Me Ruby told La Presse Canadienne that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested the occasional friend and driver of 35-year-old Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, and accused him of video extortion.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police also said they had observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby has qualified as "inexplicable" the fact that the police have never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put on listening to his phone, claiming that police chief Bill Blair has chosen to know why not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also require an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesperson Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's words as "an obvious and desperate attempt" to get a hold of himself with the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At the press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said there was nothing in this video that could be "reasonable reasons" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
The European Fellowships are declining at mid-session, except in London
With the exception of London, the main European Fellowships are declining on Friday to mid-session, led by some news from disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to increase.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could set off its quantitative flexibility policy earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of an inflation of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is widespread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street leave the prospect of an ever-increasing US action, after two consecutive replication sessions.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the highest replica of CAC 40, led by the warning on the result of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after it also published results on the decline this morning and announced the creation of an internal failure structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the forefront of EuroFirst300’s increases in response to press information that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculations about the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy are going well, as John Hardy, a strategist at Saxony Bank.
The ECB's unique mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for euro decline.
In this context, the euro continues its decline against the US currency and has touched a lower than two weeks in session at $1,3517.
These same conjectures are inversely supporting the euro area bond market.
The Supreme Court validates Obama's Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court said today that Obama's ratified health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to support health insurance by 2014, on the ground that they must pay a fine – and declared that it was constitutional under the authority of the government.
The president of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page Act and considered that the provision of the health system reform law, which requires lowering the eligibility threshold in Medicaid for the loss of all federal funding of the program, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates for the presidential high school election during the 2012 primarys, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, were strongly opposed to the law.
Vibrating tribute to veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute, this Friday afternoon, to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Gerbes were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MP Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Palestinian-Israeli border crossings at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday, October 31, 2013 at night during a violent hanging on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, November 1, after the exhausting of its fuel stocks, announced the Palestinian Enclave's Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Brigades Ezzedine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another frame of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a shelling of tanks during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younès, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a Palestinian tunnel
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer raided about 100 metres inside the territory before leaving.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiqué, a Hamas spokesperson, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell in defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupant to Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," threatened the spokesperson.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, stating that the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to trade them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, and explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device aimed at the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck a military base in north-west Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday, 31 October, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not report any details on the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Officials of the Israeli Government refused to confirm any information concerning such an attack.
Citing the "exclusive sources" that it did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain stated that "the bombing targeted a shipment of air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that fights rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard at dawn on Wednesday in an air defence base at Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents to Dance his two new group choreographies: the first inspired by Henry Michaux's ink and poems, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and black of ink to white.
A white screen served as a background wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advances, profile, thin as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the whole room: a parade of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next graph appears, the incarnation, emerges in the current.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux takes place in solo relays, group with the unison (a mass that makes the solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Glory of the Morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, put online at the front stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be cracks when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance rug, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, part of the poem of Michaux, monocord and monotone in the cry, and continue dancing.
And the music to go, and the sequence to resume.
This loud and energetic discharge, if possible, ends up to drowning and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like these hairs that get bored or these black tissues that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
The impression is that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux' work, imposed himself, with his tics.
Result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
The inks of Michaux, like the shapes of Gestalt, open a broader and more gizzardy imaginative than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers caught by stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches magic.
The audience loved it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopedia, after the break, is richer.
The scene is partly draped with grays, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, such as furniture in a abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers relay to play the scores.
Their misappropriations in music, touching, give true fragility.
On stage, they pass the couples, in love duo, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, sets that move, choirs, writing is less binary.
Bouffons appear, also familiar to Chouinard, standing on the red nose, in very polarized men-female parades.
Loves are butchers, fugitives or players.
The gesture, the laughter and the small screams beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the bodies into coitus, of the beings that merge.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the public leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored overlap, the Cabotin dancers, descended from the spectators, gloating, smoking, circling, playing the applause codes, stretched the sauce in a well calculated disorder that remains sensual.
The joy and madness are sweating, and it's Chouinard's art there to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are the subject of judicial prosecutions concerning the Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents has begun avalanche of patent prosecutions on Thursday against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company that he co-fed the pot when he sold the patent auctions that took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that purchased Nortel patents for $4.5 Md, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent-infringement companies in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly detained by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that enable advertising to be displayed in relation to Internet search terms, have indicated the findings of the trial, which is Google's business heart.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture telephones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which provides fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally propose 4.4 Md$.
After losing the Nortel patents in front of Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 Md, a partial market based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although having failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents," the findings of the trial indicated.
Rockstar claims more significant damages and interests against Google because he claims that Google's patent violation is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit up a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, said Friday night the king's prosecutor's replacement.
The expert posted on-site by the public prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit up a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The life-threatening prediction of both victims is still under way.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and was severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying at his grandfather's house and his companion, was at his side and was burned more slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on site before they were taken to the CHU of Liège, in a helicopter, in an ambulance," said the burgundy José Paulet, who descended to the places.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Healthy and except, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairs remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
The civil protection of Crisnée has stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to swear
Mohamed Morsi gave the investment oath, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he gave the oath of investment to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took an oath before the 18 judges in black dress of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Mr Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and hard-pressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 o'clock, local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to acquit the new president and, starting from the presidential phase of the Moubarak years, the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy into the very frequent streets connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered as the little charismatic "help wheel" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has been greatly strengthened since his victory and his speech on Friday during which he tried to present himself as not only the candidate of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun at the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Moubarak.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the wooden hall where he swore.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was in custody.
Marechal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand..." surrounded by thousands of people gathered in the grand amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi swore a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended the Mubarak authoritarian regime last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the former defeated president, deposed him.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The U.S. shutdown has slowed the rise in the car market
The 16-day closure of most federal administrations weighed on the growth of sales of cars in the United States in October, showing the figures published by manufacturers on Friday, five of the six main performances below expectations.
The three major manufacturers of Detroit show two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated on average 15.4 million sales in an annualized and seasonally adjusted pace but the market stood at 15.3 million according to the estimates of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's analyst.
In a note to the customers of the bank, he believes that this slight stoppage is primarily explained by the government's "shutdown" and its impact on the consumer's feelings during the first fortnight of the month".
However, GM reported an increase of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by the consensus.
The four brands of the group saw their commercial performance improving compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-up, saw its sales grow from 14% over one year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was waiting for 194,301.
On the other hand, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared with 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also have lower-consensus sales, despite increases over a year of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM's action won 1.4% at 16:35 GMT, while Ford won 1.1%.
Renault flew into the Stock Exchange with a warning from Nissan
Renault accuses Friday the biggest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had reduced by almost 20% its forecast of annual net profit, reported traders.
Nissan, who had to make such a revision, also announced a revision of his leadership.
Several traders reported that Renault's action was affected this morning by "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's saving profit," said a manager of the trading of a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese builder 15% of French, according to Nissan's website data.
Greece: Two dead in a rifle near a neo-Nazi party site
Two people were killed and another was severely wounded Friday night by fires fired by two people on a motorcycle passing by a location of the golden neo-Nazi party in the western suburb of Athens, a police source was learned.
The police were currently unable to provide information on the identity of victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that golden Aube members had claimed that the victims were guardians of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, depending on the same source.
Police officers from the counter-terrorism service moved to the central avenue of suburban New Iraq, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident occurs a few weeks after the indictment of six deputies of Golden Aube, including the party's leader and founder, for participation in a "criminal organization" in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, saw his call rejected and will be well suspended for the next two league matches of his club champions, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Barça for having addressed a coup in Neymar, the Scottish community saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a press release, his club called himself "very disappointed", believing that his call was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the black, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The large Montreal region also has a lot of pans with nearly 7,000 private homes of electricity in the metropolis and Laval.
You thought the travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has reviewed its forecast of net profits rising and hopes for record results through the Australian and UK vacationers.
The travel agency is now expected to achieve a underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million before tax, against a previous estimate of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are achieved, this will represent 12-17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre had made 8% profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started in force, in particular with regard to travel other than business trips to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are in the right way to achieve record results throughout the year before interest and tax deductions are deducted," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector increased during the second half, making it possible to compensate for a domestic market for small-scale business travel.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre's leisure travel sector has achieved good results while business customers have spent less.
Her subsidiary in the United States recovered her losses during the first half of the year where seasonal demand is lower and should benefit over the whole year for the third time consecutive.
Flight Centre's actions increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown draw on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Caught unknowns opened the fire this Friday at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making victims, as a result of an apparent quarrel with disembarked employees.
Assailants fled, the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, police general Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt has received almost no tourists since the army has deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and represses in the blood the demonstrations of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature, students will have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to today.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A combined language and literature course will be deleted.
From 2015, students will have to pass an independent-language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamentals next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Review Regulatory Office, will reveal a change in the structure of the CSFs, with a new rating system and less courses.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was a "wide consensus on the need to reform our system of reviews to restore public confidence," insisting that the CSFs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours a year, 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore spend about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to maths, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of deep maths – as well as the greater importance of materials in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of training.
The programme will focus more on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and widely challenging the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An eight-year-old welcomes children with a Muy rifle for Halloween
The minors aged 9 and 13 went from door to door to demand candy on Halloween night.
One of the riverbanks in the Muy district visited by the children opened the door by holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The former chief of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, said the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"They were buried in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte in 1945," he assured the daily large-scale press, relying on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great enigmas of the After-War.
The German secret services, the BND, were in charge and in the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were totally wrong.
"Since August 1945, Müller's body was found in a provisional tomb near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," said Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing "a uniform of generals."
"In the left inner pocket were in particular its service statements with a photo," he continued.
Bild also issued a document from the town hall of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists be buried in a Jewish cemetery is a huge taste.
"The memory of the victims is massed from the foot," he rose in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He took part in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and was, in particular, led by Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

It walks in mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to choose the "Heros CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alter the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry the sequele for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken her abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to obtain any treatment he could benefit from.
"It's not easy," added Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock, crash at the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor per 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 people.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country's health expenditures are realized in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwell.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and as many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed more than 700 surgical acts free of charge last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaoundé.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they start in vans after setting medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to get to the villages that need the most help.
Chance doesn't always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push vehicles to cross muddy rivers or trails.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team started receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people on every visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this roaming hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive bequeaths, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – a document necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgery under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school, mayoral or house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the waking room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers are working until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It's an exciting rhythm, but village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," Bwelle explained.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work she has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian physicians and medical students, practiced 700 surgical acts free of charge in the past year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those whom they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He is always in the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to carry out these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr Bwelle in his missions, it is an opportunity to learn in the field they do not have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help lay the blood on or pass the instruments on to Dr. Bwell," said Miss O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pensions, their transportation and education are taken care of by Dr Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not near to disappear.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happily while keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh and to relieve pain are the reasons why I do this.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexed, the academics have long painted to define and situate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
No doubt, but stressing its weakness for the crossing paths, Sciences-Po, the Higher Studies.
Arbitrator of works of others in his office of Gaston-Gallimard Street?
In fact, they ignore the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the chair occupied by Fontenelle at the French Academy?
Of course, but knowing that such a sacred thing cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the the thesis, of which it has passed.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakening, an entertainer and a federation of their works, but noting that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this image uncertainly the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The poor languages were able to see a huge flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a sharp look and look-out, but unbelievably amateur.
The two books published by Nora in the near future two years have already established that the one who passed by for not writing had much and well written.
The book here should render him final justice.
However, once again, there is the temptation of the ubiquity, the intellectual vagabondage, the retirement set to leap from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book to such a beautiful title bring the brocant to one and the same passion: that of discovering the core of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: It is a concern of the time.
Little by little, we have been collectively invited to give a definition of this.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders of then, the French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, obliged Jacobinism, was entrusted to authorized prefects and subprefects, interpreters.
What Pierre Nora's up to is everything else.
He does not inherit eternal frankness, he refuses the definition.
Worried analyst of a strange familiarity, he wanders into a forest of symbols, arrested at each step by an object in the form of a rebus, tormented with irritating questions.
One of them, who is born of the company itself: why, in a country so sustainablely settled within its borders, so old-fashioned and solidly masonaged, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to conjure the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the division forces here are very old.
And the most emblematic is of course the one that divides into two national history.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but failed to deny it; rather concerned to regain its sacrality and all the more greed for unity and indivisibility that it had cut its head to the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invinciblely binary nation, shared between the left and the right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this unique French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escape could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, and wanted to establish a new society.
But American co-ordination only makes us more aware of what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no more to worry about it.
Here, men covered with an Old Indigenous Regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and confit.
There are always respected founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to make, and who have been among themselves.
There's an institutional constancy, and here's a cascade of constitutions, like as many errors to catch up and tests to resume.
France who leaves, France who comes
There was, however, a time when the French believed they could use the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
In this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then used to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in the former France was evidently preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity had only one time.
Here again in the debate, surrounded by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed in the European area.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France that leaves and the circumspect sketch of France that comes.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, which should reserve a few surprises.
We found out that the fireplace was a married man.
The man of multiple curiosity revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The windshield was held in the center of the centre.
And he who had deposited, here more than a half century, a subject on the idea of the nation, but had withdrawn from the initiatory exercise of the the thesis, confides us, with grain salts, that he will have done it.
Certain in a less steep form, more exploded and more subtle.
But let us not be deceived, just as binding.
For much more than the figure imposed by the academic course, this thesis says the internal necessity of a life.
An old hostage in Lebanon: "Back is pretty complex to manage"
Taken in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team filming a Hezbollah event, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he has participated in the creation of the "Otage of the World" hostage defence association, which he has been president of for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to file complaints and bring their hostage takers to the International Criminal Court.
Detained more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grade military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have been able to find their families ever since.
And slowly try to take the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Norman, 62 years old, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the "Otches du mondo" association.
From the night of your release, you were on the 20h stage of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Water.
He says, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me that we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They're putting us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive at the site of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
From the French take us to the Embassy of France.
It's time for the first shots to the parents, the family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in T-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night talking with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arrived there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did your arrival on the French soil take place?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a bit brutal.
There's an incredible compass.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and it's full.
The descent of the plane's ladder, the encounters with my son and my parents, my friends, all is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull the drum to make pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little police to prevent some from going up.
Media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We're out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media fire.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, rather complex to manage.
But we made it hard.
The very same night, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV.
Then start a kind of life-rehabilitation, very gently, for a month or two that are a little like vacations.
How did medical examinations and debriefing DGSE go?
I had the right to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grace the following days I returned: radios, exams of all kinds and met with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything, but we know we can count on it, remember it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostage takers.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of Niger?
I'm listening to what he says.
The debate on ransoms, in particular.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I'm trying to do the part between the questions on my past as a hostage and my chasket as president of the "Otage of the World" association that allows me to distance myself, and I find it much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, along with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
It is necessary to qualify hostages for "political" hostages - which is the case most of the time - and to allow hostages to have access to justice, to complain and bring their hostage takers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why don't we tell hostage takers "you have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, to be grounded, legitimate, struck with common sense.
This message is heard, but it didn't listen, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger is growing in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of President Mohamed Morsi, they went down the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected President.
It is not a trial that emphasizes this militant of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Until now no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial with a pro-Morsi, he is supposed to have Sisi judge, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Confrontations broke out in Alexandria, the police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo police academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel reproaches 9 U.S. States for violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state has recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to an identity card from the Department of Defence and to benefits that come with," the Minister in New York recalled in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to spouses of the same sex in the facilities of the National Guard" located on their territory, he denounced, accusing those States of violating the federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these maps, these persons cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided on these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said he had ordered General Frank Grass to ensure that federal law was implemented.
The leaf of the nine states began by Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the settlements of the Texan National Guard, owing to a conflict between the Texan and the federal gay marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Western Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5,600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the Reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
The registrations are held on site Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin in the run, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the renewal of the prices at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young prodigy hierois Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen and he does not like anything until he shows it to competitors who exceed him by three heads.
The Mayor of Toronto hunts journalists to ask him about a drug case
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug abuse, according to several media outlets.
A video sent to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, has always denied having used crack, while acknowledging having a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he threw out his property several journalists came to question him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanations or comments.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday, October 31, that a case of rabies had been detected in a caton in the Val-d'Oise, evidently of foreign origin while France has been free from indigenous cases since 2001.
The caton was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The rabies diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological survey has been undertaken to identify and take care of persons who could have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October inclusive," said the Ministry of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In man, the preventive treatment of human rage, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the symptoms appear, is very effective," the communiqué states.
The departments now call on those who would have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous mucosa or on a skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"Since France has been free from rage since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free", according to the communiqué.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded "autotone" case dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on an illegally imported dog from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
"Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," the ministries recall, and it is transmitted for about 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama is backtracking on his health system reform
In an avalanche of criticism, President Obama came back yesterday on his unambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people have received notice of termination from their suppliers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days by accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with adequate health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "an effervescence in the news" about terminations, President Obama urged Americans who were receiving this opinion to seek a new market insurance.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better adapted health plans for the same price, even less expensive than expected.
"You're going to win," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population that hires their own insurance were forced to change their regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "sortly".
"I'm as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I'm looking forward to returning your trust.
It was a desperate Kathleen Sebelius who, as she believed her micro cut, turned to an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly meeting to follow up on a controversial exchange of views with Billy Long, Republican representative of Missouri, to know if she should join Obama.
For more than three hours, Billy Long repeatedly asked Ms.Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel pulls a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy elected Jake Vite Prekop combined the colors of the brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the level of the track.
The German Sebastian Vettel, quadruple World Champion of Formula 1, has worked out for the free trials of the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi Friday a special helmet whose drawing was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen from among 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, his stable.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion, on the track and on his stand.
Vettel was to carry this helmet on Friday and Saturday, to the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet, for the race, to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Town Hall Party
Let us not deceive ourselves.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not only addressed to the banlieusards.
I chose a map of France as a logo, justifying it.
When I speak of suburbanness, I address myself to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
It does not prevent its project, presented Thursday in press conference in its home town of Aubervilliers, from being born of a desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural pool meeting that characterises above all the neighborhoods.
My proposal 1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, it says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, territorially attached, claims today as "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militating in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are tied to the left but if the people on the right are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
There's only extremist parties I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its programme -consultable on the Internet - from many themes intended to speak to the inhabitants of suburban areas and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at the age of 16, the rehabilitation of the function of the custodian of building...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the municipal elections of 2014, this could be fair, he recognizes."
It's a matter of time and money.
The suburban party should still be represented at Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune already has seven list heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support e-mails I've been receiving since yesterday don't all emanate from suburbia" he rejoiced.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedented, that the American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry pointed out that the United States' defensive attitude towards its monitoring programs was slowed down by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, espionage "had gone too far in an inappropriate way".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, as well as Barack Obama, ruled on "autopilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities emerged.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr.Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War and up to the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course on September 11th."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had exceeded the borders, but he insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases it has gone too far in an inappropriate way."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he is now conducting an in-depth review of these practices so that no one feels mistaken.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was an active force for good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill people, make them explode and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to know the facts in advance.
In the meantime, US legislators will go to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged US espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken in front of members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had posed about the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorism organizations due to the feeling of frustration that the National Security Agency's supervision might provoke.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain at our side in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a democrat serving his first mandate, and President of the Subcommission for European Affairs of the U.S. Senate, during an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to help them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some U.S. allies, however, the agency's director said this week that it was inaccurate and that this was a misunderstanding because it concerned the metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents disseminated by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the spying of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip from Congress, which should take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to demonstrate "affectiveness".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes they have been applying for years.
"We can modify our monitoring programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do espionage," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry has planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the resentment generated by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, led by Shell's bad results and after an announcement by the Fed of maintaining its support for the economy, as planned.
Australian appeals to her prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely alleged being assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed for judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Province Court on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had attacked her earlier on Sunday 10 June.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket's police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to having invented the history of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local police station cell prior to the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15-day imprisonment in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a prison for women.
He is the daughter of the former player of the Australian rugby League Peter Tunks, who called on the Canberra Ministry of Foreign Affairs to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We have of course had a anxious moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a deposit of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region, southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Michelle Smith's Phuket, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to re-appropriate its deteriorating image with tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
The French police will arrest the supporters of Anderlecht who have not come with the services of the RSCA
The French police decided to lay down strict rules concerning the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain fixed on Tuesday, told Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson of the Brussels-mid police zone, Friday.
The Belgian supporters of the RSCA who will want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from an old Rekem border post to the PSG stage," the spokesperson transmitted.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture said that measures have been taken to arrest or even guard," said Marie Verbke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school committee Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This has motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to think about how to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
Vision diversity has been in schools for over a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of a strain or they have come from.
Who are our builders?
"So, we create projects so that they identify themselves to all this," explains Vision Diversity President Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne of the New World Institute identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On the transmission, for example, of Quebec culture, sense of belonging, support for staff in the transformations we live in, within the student clientele," he says.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has set up a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who, at times, also come from.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"Different educational strategies, that's the real need," she summarizes.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
