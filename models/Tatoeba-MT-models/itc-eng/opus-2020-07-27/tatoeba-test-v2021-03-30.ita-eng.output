I don't drink alcohol.
Looks like there's no way out.
We fell asleep.
I was very upset with him.
Why should we help you?
I put the plan into practice.
He made a list.
For a while I was really dependent on Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.

These monks live inside the monastery.
I just have to find him.
Can I see this?
He's able to speak in Japanese.
I could be wrong.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?
Tom will find a job soon enough.
Correct the highlighted words.
Did you tell him you were kidding?
Keep looking.
When the results get public, I'll let you know.

Tom is pleased with your success.
You're reliable.

You can only smoke on the terrace.
I agree with 100%.
These flowers besides being beautiful also have a good scent.
He's in college now, isn't he?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remind him.
Tom said he likes to teach French.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Are you two getting along with her?
Who breaks this window?
I'll tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you'd trade him for a Frenchman.
It's ten minutes later.
We waited for her yesterday.
Tom said Mary was low.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's very unlikely.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to prove it.
She's depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you Mary's husband?
It was all your imagination.
I'm not going to vote!
Why can't you do that?

They have many different fish to try.
What is the difference between real diamonds and imitations?
Could you call me back later?
I would like two copies of each of these documents.

What do you think of the new teacher?
If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen more powerful than the sword?
She bought a tea service.
We're all gonna die.
Tom continued to cry.
I can't do that yet.
George was out of his mind about anger!

Are you willing to learn?
The poor are also people with feelings.
I'm sure Tom's just trying to help.
You smell so good.
I forgot everything about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm messed up.

I got home late last night.
We finished petrol in the middle of the desert.
Don't worry, I'll be home safe.

I can't run a company, it's too hard for me.
You're learning French?
Is that your son?
Tom never asked why.
He was often up late.
I don't eat bananas often.
Get them out of here.

He was the first to help her.
Are the kids already sleeping?
We have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom wasn't very active.
We cleaned the road from the snow yesterday.
I'm not busy now at all.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe he should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
You got a move on, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at Hyogo University.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe I should tell you.
I know what to study.
His life went on smoothly.
No one wants to help us.
They talk very fast.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He had no money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there many sharks around here?
Tomorrow, if God wants, we'll be with your parents.
It comes from Sweden.
He had no money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like smooth fish.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this fun, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20th.
It's a beautiful picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated her.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom works here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have any plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich just like you.
We had a good time.
She's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got upset.
I'm old.
I have the dirty criminal fiancee.
Good night, my friends.
I bought an English book in a bookstore.
Tomorrow I go to the bookstore to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom's saying?
What is your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody go.
Giant pandas only live in China.
I'm coming along.
Don't say that.
It's getting worse!
Jim is Canadian.
You've done well here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm relaxed.
The cattle were grazing in the field.
He entered his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom's still missing.
I ate all the apple.
It roasts the bhakri while the pot is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only prepare uighur food.
We leave Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing football.
Stop babbling.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
It doesn't sound too surprised.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's infected, isn't he?
Does this cage have the purpose of protecting from sharks?
Tom wants to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
You don't want a job?
I was playing the horn when I was younger.
I'm faithful.
Can I write in Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they're talking French.
Step forward.
You need to become more active.
Are Tom and Mary kidding?
He broke the smoke.
I have no choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than him.
What will this summer do?
He's become irritated.
Do you know how to speak Shanghai?
He stopped because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom asked what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much has it been paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
He's still there with you, isn't he?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
What's your favorite rapper woman?
Say hi to Tom for me.
It's good to see you so happy.
I usually swim in summer.
Why are you leaving early?
I'm pretty proud of that.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's your picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Give me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to you at a conference.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom introduced himself soon for the lesson.
It's a little overweight, isn't it?
Who's the man playing the plan?
I've decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his drinks.
Look harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does she look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's beginning to rain.
Do you play any tools?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
She convinced the teacher.
When's your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
Snow today.
He promised to write me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot whether you drink wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give you 50 grand for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay in the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not very funny at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the keys to the car.
I don't really want to talk.
So he must be Argentine.
I really like my work.
I would suggest you be more careful.
She's shaken up.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.
He'll be back in the afternoon.
He became blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that picture?
How many continents in the world?
He's good at singing, isn't he?
Tom's mad at Mary, isn't he?
His idea is superior to his.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom's getting emotional.
I was just scared.
It's a party tomorrow.
I drank too much beer yesterday.
I'd like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy.
I appreciate your insights.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary's jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't get much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you want.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He's playing the drum.
It must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use more?
Light the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before coming to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German machines are among the best.
Call them.
That's cool.
Tom does not respect Maria's views.
I'll get the camp.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom's nice?
I can't give Mary anything she wants.
When does the school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
She hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I could meet someone who can help you.
Can you ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a pattern.
She brought me a cup of sugar-free tea.
It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three more years old than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Watch your tongue.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're in advance again.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
You want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose what you want.
I'm in the hospital, I was hit by lightning.
Did you call them?
Spend the radio.
Why did you decide to become a teacher?
It was a really scary story.
He's in the van.
I don't introduce them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe us? We are in Europe!
I waited for a bus to arrive.
He found the chemist.
You'll never guess where I am.
I didn't do well.
You students are required to be diligent.
I won't be able to help you.
It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappears behind a cloud.
You are interested in politics.
Many people go to church at Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I don't know how to drive very well.
I heard Tom's learning how to drive.
She knows I love her deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is, we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I fell the branch with an axe.
The minigons are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least six o'clock.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
Are you Mary?
After dinner walking on the beach.
Why didn't he go with him?
He's two years older than him.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You've got the wrong number.
Age is not a result, and youth is not a sin.
I've known him for over ten years.
We're grateful for the music that left us.
It's not that the idea of putting home an ammoniac appliances attracts me a lot.
Judy's a very smart student.
We knew the dog would run behind the cat.
I'm a cop.
You kissed her, didn't you?
Why don't I just buy her a hat?
I thought Tom would be alive.
She's paralyzed with bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom's my dad.
We don't have to go yet.
Do you like the mountain?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
Come on aboard.
You're fascinating.
People drink tea in their country?
I don't want to waste any more time.
We lost sight of him.

Go wake them up.

I don't believe a word of what you say.
Get out of the way!
Only Naoko drinks coffee.
Sami needed to use the bathroom.
He changed his name.
You're vulgar.

We can help you.
They called us.

The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a hard start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
You again!
Why do these things always happen to me?
Birds are hitting the ground.
The park is closed Monday.
Didn't you even update the firmware?
I have a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do it now?
They like all my friends.
I like my language.
Why won't you answer me?
We're Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's practicing.
Are you coming in?
Which way should I start?
Have you studied Darwin's theory of evolution?
His horse had a heart attack.
It's worth visiting the ruins.
He should be ready for the worst.

This reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember your plate number?
He told us a lie.
You have seven children.
We're listening to music.
I think it's dangerous for kids to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Bring it to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We must postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't even matter.
We were separated.
It's really early.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
This happened to me.
He doesn't have a few friends in America.
I wasn't living in Boston last year.
Read this book tonight?
Does Tom have a car?
I'll be fine, don't worry.
Tom laughs rarely.
I can't forget your smile.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know Canadians living in Australia?
Tom's boring, isn't he?

Do you like it?
What exactly do you want me to do, Tom?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom didn't like it very much.
Could you wash the dishes, please?
Lunch was great.
She turned off the computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remembered.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She was supposed to share a bedroom with her sister.
I heard the door shut.
He made him drunk.
How are you feeling today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You're hostile.
I don't feel nervous.

We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
She went red.
Don't bother him.
We were good.
You started acting strangely.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
Would you like me to go?
You left this, didn't you?
Tell us something.
You're random.
Please, lower the music.
I train Tom for work.
He was watching him swim.
Who broke the vase?
You'd better go with him.

You're bothering her.
Sami is not here to ruin your day.
Take off my shoes.
I'm learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Those are yours?
The woman drinks water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it will soon close if food doesn't have a good taste.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He's changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.
I'm free tonight.
You think I'm too high?
What should we do now?
Tom developed a new technique.
Were you blindfolded?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrists.
You look relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He doesn't listen.
I bought it in a user store.
Why don't you do it on your own?
He's finally here!
Tom thinks they'll all be here in the middle of the day.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It has no meaning.

You helped him.
Everyone was talking about it.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates bats.
Go home.

Where's my money?
No one saw her do it.

You guys are ready.
Why should I talk to them?
I won't forget.
I don't want to forget it.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I bought myself a pair of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.

I'll stay.
I'm not always busy.
I'll see you.
I got up before dawn.

We're getting closer.
Tom always says the same thing.
Did you talk to Tom?
Try to get some rest.
Do you have a Facebook account?
She asked how to cook the fish.
No one will believe his story.
Tom's a golden boy.
You seem to be prevented from ideas coming from foreign countries.
I bought that book for him.
I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
She's making me throw up.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock broke.
I won't wait forever.
Just give me the order.
Do you know any of the Canadians who live in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.

I hope Tom's not angry.
The rock has been moved with dynamite.
Mary prepared breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was Mona Lisa?

You can hold them.
This smell is unbearable.
You've become famous.
What are you indicating?
I became a friend to him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
You made the balloon.
We have to go.
Staying home is not fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like your son to study more.
I opened an account at a bank nearby.
I didn't like that.
Can you be sure?
It was nice to see you.
You don't have to worry.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He clearly wants to go.
I knew Tom would do something romantic.
How much paper do you need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.
Tom's talking to Mary on the phone.
Get some wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one currency.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Take the picture.
You are my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did he eat?
He's the last person to tell a lie.
June is not that far, either.
Why does he hate Tom so much?
Do you know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
I got my shoes wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you leaving me?
You've always liked Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, OK?
You wanted to ask me questions?
Don't be kidding Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I've been taking risks.
Two people were killed in a road accident.
You know Tom, don't you?
It wasn't my idea to hire them.
Last night my grandmother missed without suffering.
I know why you're angry with them.
You know Tom likes cars.
You passed the exam.
Tom imitated Mary.
I can read Spanish easily.
Should I use ink?
Don't fall out of the chair.
Tom sent us Christmas gifts.
Can't Tom swim?
Children usually get up early in Christmas.
I'll be your guide.
How long do you study English every day?
Why does he look suspicious?
I can't do anything for you.
Dad's good.
I think they're ready.
Tom will try again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a board game.
They all believed him.
It means an enormous increase in air conditioning use, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.

Those are crocodile tears.
He might have said something earlier.
The job leaves traces on Tatoeba...
Do you like carrots?
I have a dollar every thirty minutes.
Tom's a lot older now.
Tom's better.
I think Tom's a pessimistic.
You have to help them.
Sometimes I write to my mother.
You don't trust anyone.
I regret never being nice to him.
Make Tom call me.
He hasn't changed anything.
She's not wearing her hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why is he not sitting with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too soon.
I should have eaten more.
Of twenty students, only one has read the book.
To love someone means to see it as God understood it.
Don't lie to them.
Do they live with you?
I don't know how he did this.
I'm not sure if George will like this idea.
They're afraid to say it publicly.
Please, identify yourself.
Let us go.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I lost him.
I almost dropped the plates.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom composed 911.
We are brother and sister.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
This week was nice.
You want a tray with that?
You don't know me.
No one wants to work.
Please, drive slowly.
How do we do it?
This is last month's magazine.
They're not back yet.
He's about your age, isn't he?
He's in the back.
We can't let them die.
It's a bundle of nerves.
Tom arrived late.
Tom stayed back.
This point will be discussed tomorrow.
How did you spend your vacation?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved to the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary did it right.
Have you ever talked to him?
I don't think Tom will be able to do that.
When did you get back from London?
Tom's always good.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom sneezed for a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, right?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It looks so fake.
Everyone's dead.
I don't want you in my car.

Of course you told a lie.
Something was going on.
Ship it by mail.
It's interesting, isn't it?
Mary accidentally ran into Tom.
I'm nobody's enemy.
I forgot her number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to be honest?
What are you gonna do?
Tom seems tired, take him home, please.
May all your desires come true!
He already did.
He is experienced with a word processor.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
His table is ready.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, don't they?
Now let's talk.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit him in the head.
It'll be so much fun.
Tom told Mary what not to do.
Do your business!
She was extremely scary.
I'm telling a story.
You're homeless, aren't you?
What will you eat tomorrow?
I've seen the movie before.
Sophie, who was hungry, ate everything she could take.
Are they Tom and Mary?
There is no future in his use.
Tom and I often study together.
Tom and Mary are very happy here.
Do you like traveling?
I want to go back to Tom's.
He has strong principles.
He was buried in this cemetery.
Again, bye.
Good luck meeting you here.

It is disease to be obsessed with victory, it is disease to be obsessed with the use of martial arts, and it is disease to be obsessed with presenting everything you learned. It is disease to be obsessed with attack, and it is also disease to be obsessed with defense. It is also disease to be obsessed with getting rid of the disease. To fix your mind obsessively on anything is considered disease.
