The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the early morning fall, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in ČEZ's shares reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of March, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it dropped to about 6%.
The fall this time is due to the fall of actions on Wall Street.
Here, too, the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote by the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the plan to stabilize the financial sector secretary.
Loss of shares in Asia
The shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally mitigated some of the losses.
Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Index over its financial day marked almost four percent, although later reduced its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows Chinese stock movements in Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped 3.8 percent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
Sidney’s stock exchange lost more than five percent, but in the end, the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Index Secretary dropped to 3.6 percent.
"The rescue actions scheduled in the United States are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world," said the Head of the Hong Kong Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens to make the falls feel in other countries.
Bloody bathroom for American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan to which $700 billion (about 12 billion crowns) should be devoted.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, the American actions lived a bloody bath and mainly the index of the actions collected the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to almost seven percent. A similar drop in volume was last recorded in 1987.
The index was already dropped before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal was not going forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress retires: The U.S. government can inject 700 billion dollars into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial assistance to the American finance system.
Your vote will take place early next week.
The American legislators sparked a gap in the discussions on the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with an amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
However, he is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law public and vote.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday at the Representatives Assembly.
He told Reuters, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee for Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms which will also be achieved in practice by market aid.
Paulson: Plan must be effective
"We've made a great move.
We have resolved our conflicting views on how the package of measures for market stabilization should take place," Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive form to the Government Fund.
It should buy from financial companies unsold mortgage assets that lead to severe losses and threaten system-wide stability.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we're already on it," Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis expressly affects the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Senator Democrat by Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing their best to get Congress to finalize an agreement this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses in the Asian finance market as these are the ones in the first time slot and where Congress could influence the trade on Monday.
However, for now there is nothing clear about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote, and not even if they will not be stagnated at the last moment with some problem.
The legislators believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a series of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme was not fulfilling its role, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush valued the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was retained that it was to gain financial resources for the purchase of bad mortgages whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also pleased with the advance of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the advance of Saturday and that he appreciates "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armoured contract
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, chief of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the programme's money for the protection of taxpayers' taxes from their losses, a relief clause of the planned financial plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called armoured contracts for directors of participating companies, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards the convention that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also has to help homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly charges of the debtors' timely payments and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And that's why you don't know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"A lot more important is that, once this week, the congressmen agree on their support and give their visas as good as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to reach that approval is, at present, the most important one," Marek insisted.
Armed Hand Fight: MP3 Player Against Mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it's better to buy just the phone.
Still there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on how they are used and the need of the future owner.
It will probably be hard for you to acquire the most modern record to listen to in it the last album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP disks no longer leave, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is no objective reason to continue to buy them.
If vinyl discs with rock music, jazz or blues are found on their shelves, you are probably dreaming of at least this type of record.
This is the same with the music that is on its way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, as well as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly test the commercial helmets of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for each.
The choice is broad.
Also decides the battery duration
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even that which not even most mobile.
No current apparatus is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most basic functions such as phone, send messages, can play music and video, record both, has a better or worse camera and can even navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDAs will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle because no refrigerator can make a grill and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone will first be illuminated by the screen indicator asking to be reloaded.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy tragons.
Few are the mobiles that can play music more than ten or twelve hours, most of which are much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, be aware that cheap mobiles will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, above, they constantly call themselves still, for more security, a shipper for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst lasts at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when you record music on the mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced reader units can connect the small memory cards that are used on the mobiles.
In players, with any exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through your computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the interpreter, album title, gender or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a tree structure directory similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a concrete team is interested in the strength of the accumulator, in the capacity of memory, in the quality and type of sound output and, of course, in the comfort of its management.
If you listen, above all, to music as background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as on the tram, then it is enough with any mobile that reproduces.
What almost really gets any mobile.
It should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player plays the music.
The MP3 plays it all and almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most extended and except for it the absolute majority of devices reproduce music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and your iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
Simply use the mobile internet to visit the operator’s (or any other service provider’s) pages and buy a song or album.
This service could in itself be a weight argument to acquire a mobile phone for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and most of them are confined only to the themes of fleeting success of radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, this way of selling music (either via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) is supposed to dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry a cell phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find the mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, handlesfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually each mobile even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many music mobiles will be your price.
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be confined to the absence of a classic headphone entry.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as telephones equipped with an entrance of 3.5 mm. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest ones (see our selection) - really handles any person.
The minimal functions, their handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also the record player are evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the Internet with the mobile phone and, consequently, gigantic data loss account.
For which apparatus to be decided
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a proper card you will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are normally equipped with only one 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy still a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on capacity (maximum 2 GB) more than 1,100 crowns need not be spent.
If you consider yourself one of the most demanding lovers of music to hand over the most specialized mobilewalkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line phones have almost the same use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum yield of up to 35 hours), the most cited brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will already arrive, this year, to the Czech Republic.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer almost all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
Probably won't be long enough to get there.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed this by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most expensive in the whole Union.
Following the recent steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming fees regulation, it is likely to reach a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS sending from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks competition that really wants to fight.
This is probably paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú), Pavel Dvořák, has already stated that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network no longer have too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a remarkable price drop before which the classic operators should also react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to Britain's market, voices similar to those were heard here and there.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can be successful.
On the other hand, there is no need to look for too far away examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to get over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on many more specific target groups.
In addition, so that they can function effectively, it is enough for many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that however, often counters with the most adjusted service offer.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers at least half of cheap SMS with respect to competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to bet on a trivial target group.
This operator is specifically addressed to man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - it's the operator who likes and whom you can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if it looks like a Polish concept could catch up in our country.
The Vodafone spokesperson, Miroslav Čepický, doubted of this: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of the supply of services is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be any virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in Czech R. doesn't seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," he said in telephone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Stutničková, spokesman for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly assured that current mobile telephony operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition.
Interest on the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows it by the group GTS Novera that I would like to take a step forward to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile telephony operators.
With some of them we have been able to move forward in the meetings," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So, maybe they're flashing better times.
It seems that, for non-official information, the first official operator would probably have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At present we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
To date no one has been addressed to us with some complex and serious project in this field," he said for mobile.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
The spokesperson for T-mobile, Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2's opinion, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
And add: "On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find some virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contracts that it would be possible to study on such short horizons"
Vodafone directs its attention to compliance with the requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this with regard to the distribution of expenditure and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the greatest contribution from the clients' point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partnership with which to establish a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - with uña operators and meat
Progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a price drop and thereby a decrease in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull off the same rope, proof of it is the grip when U:phone came up.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on the ČTU was at the time of the entry of U:phone by T-Mobile society.
It testifies to the public information accessible on the ČTú websites.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds this: "Evens, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile telephony market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the market in mobile telephony in the Czech Republic, it is natural that another player's entry into the market would imply to him and, above all, to his large services requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute uninterest of the Czech regulator.
This is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in trade tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Licensing (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position on this issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator was concluded.
To date no agreement has been closed since the offer of potential stakeholders rather was not interesting enough for classic operators," Kristian Chalupa, from the UOHS external relations department, added to our question.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that are to represent the interests of consumers, this is something more than consideration, apart from this they must observe that no one takes advantage of his position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In abroad where virtual operators operate normally we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the price drop of mobile telephony services"
Of course, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and price drop does not fall within the interest of UOHS.
It is truly shocking in all this case that the sounding reactions resulting from the three mobile operators are causing.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in the gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has not found signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore, they do not have a corresponding rise in liability in their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as the telecommunication regulators," he added to his response Chalupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is clearly an analysis of relevant markets developed by the ČTú that telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position in this type of market.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge is always necessary to deal with the network administrator.
And the mobile telephony operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for UOHS should represent a warning the fact that three mobile operators are strikingly ascending in the same way.
The current complaints from stakeholders (injured by the so-called GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with operators there are many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility in the ČTú is a rather common trick in the field of telecommunications from which UOHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We've already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately a new amendment to the telecommunications law was tabled recently for the expansion of the competition of the ČTU in the field of commercial tenders that did not take effect, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
The representatives of UOHS should know this perfectly, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one looks
At the same time, unappreciatedly it still works as a pseudovirtual operator that in the Czech mobile telephone networks there already exist a few.
They are companies that put their own prices to mobile telephony services which, however, are only one part public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few elected get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the company in charge of a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will later receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases such as those cited could be found to be referred to in terms of contract conditions that could be translated into the end of collaboration with the given society," she answered the question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that a kind of activity carried out by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned above may become thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies, they gain nothing despicable and, at the same time - unlike the true virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are only used by so much a per cent of customers.
These must also accept that your phone's SIM card is not in your name so you can't absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of operators."
Precisely this is what should seem to the least strange ČTU.
There is also a new question for UOHS.
If mobile telephony operators surround their eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to discover these types of activities and whether it is not going to want to be content with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive?
As was clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market resulted in a significant decrease in service prices.
At the same time, virtually in all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, classic operators tried to protect themselves from this eruption.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, eventually too saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases have defended operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure, they made the first virtual operator emerge and with it began to arise more.
Unfortunately, the Czech Organ of Regulation all this case passes it as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience, we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of powers in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this information between backrests is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech market of mobile telephony is likely to start moving again.
If any of the operators let in any virtual mobile telephony operator it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the hymn Where, my home.
The new anthem recorded it by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one by male voice and another by female voice, another by Coro and another instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are responsible for the singing.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already said before that it intentionally chose for the Singing solos with representative young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with the two and then, also, with the Choir that were fixed in the dictionary so that the text would be well understood, so that it might have consonance," he said.
The Czech official anthem celebrates next year on 175 anniversary.
The song Where, my Home played for the first time in 1834 in the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The MHD of Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of the Prague Transportation Company the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper note.
This can now be purchased by almost one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day bonus and the annual bonus (this will be valid as of 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card in the infocentres and positions of the transport company at the Metro stations, Muzeum, M'stek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Bonuses can already be purchased on the Internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, up to the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of trade, can definitely start to forget about the ticket sales posts at subway stations, where so far they had to queue regularly to get out a regular ticket.
The bonus is purchased on the Internet, and the Opencard card is reloaded to you in one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is at hand a window with trained staff that helps those interested in internet shopping and also with the recharging of the bonus purchased on your card," said the project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to reload the e-bony on the Opencard in the vending machines that are found in some subway halls.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a pick-up machine and the travelers will probably have already been fixed on them at the stations of the Roztyly Metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city but at the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
Using the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just enter the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be loaded only on it.
The electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In other words, in the circumvalition trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus area," explained the ticket control, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that sets the schedules for the collective transport of Prague.
Surrounding buses have their reader cards mounted on the driver's locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard at the location intended for it on the side of the Fund.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal completed.
Passengers who do not travel on circumvalition buses and do not remember when they are finished the validity of the bonus can go to the vending machines where the cards are reloaded.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be presented with information on the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. referendum
In 1945, German Sudets called for Fumaba to be part of the United States.
This is what is taken from the letter that is stored in the collection of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, some German groups of the Swedes were allegedly addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
As a result, cards that are stored in a particular file are stored in the South Bohemian Scientific Library collection today.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American President that he would not allow the return of the "Terre Šumava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as deliverers" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry Šumava's destiny in their hearts."
In view of the fact that the Czechoslovakia union with the south-eastern Germans presumably assumes - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American President who assumes for today and forever to Šumava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of four million inhabitants, we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all it collaborates with the victory of the allies," the letter says.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals of the "Czech Oppressors".
If the president of the United States was presumably doubted about this idea of Germans šumavos, it would suffice to organize a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under their patronage.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of the postwar history, may sound a little childish, according to some experts finely depicting the expectations of the Germans of the southeast then.
Although the Czech Germans had to understand at least that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate for the Swedes some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
This one was in the war, like German of Budějovice, wrapped in the Baltic Navy.
When the British arrested him at the end of the war and placed him in Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought when they came home, the Czech would sell them well," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that on the basis of the Orders of Goods would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think--pays!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Media Transport on Wednesday.
The minister's office, Aleš .ebíček promises to dissuade drivers from dangerous behaviour at the steering wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, internet and brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol at the steering wheel.
And also to remind you that before the belts are turned on.
He wants to reach awareness especially of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and ultimately also professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that embuse emotions.
And for this we are testified to by the "blood" announcements throughout the campaign:
Don't think--pays!
The word "Don't Think" is written with great letters on the plate.
And in a blood tank is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that man can come to pay with his own life at a time of insurrection.
The announcements are going to "fear" the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign on Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be seen.
It promises that it will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and brass for drivers
"For drivers the sugar and whip system is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and it saves time.
Latigo is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says hospital transport psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Kořán.
And that's why we need an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative publicity, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," said Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the Israeli provisional government, Ehud Olmert, spoke about the restitution of practically all the land occupied in 1967, i.e. the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
I proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we must necessarily return almost all the lands (occupied) if not all of them," Olmert said the daily.
"I'm sure we'll stay with a few percent of these lands, but the Palestinians will have to give them a percent similar (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the case of restitution, this would also be included in Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as he passed one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city where several dead and tens of people were wounded.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, a sacred and historic place" within the ancient city.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golán Highs
Olmert was also pronounced by Israel's withdrawal from the Golán Highs, which from his point of view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to take off to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with the Hizbulah (the Shia Movement), they must withdraw from the permanent support that causes the terrorism of Hamas (the Shia Movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are the saffrons illegal on buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long distance bus
In relation to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padua, we are asked whether the snowflakes and passengers can move by the bus during the journey.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of the Azafata is opposed to the road traffic law," says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which last week the twenty-two-year-old saffron died, evidently was caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the precise moment the saffron distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Long distance buses from Student Agency do not have places to stand, which confirmed the company's director, Radim Jančura, to Aksuálně.cz.
"This we have solved with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is on the way if they have a seat," he told us.
Azafata doesn't know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the saffron - no legal provision clarifys this function.
Not even any legal provision forbids transport agents to perform any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined", adds, less accurately, the spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law is sufficiently sensitive to this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval permitted to have on foot sites.
That's all," he says.
The buses are divided among the urban areas, where there are places to stand and at maximum speed, interurban with sites to stand with higher speed permit and those of long distances without sites to stand, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with safety belt.
As on the plane, says the expert
BESIP's Transport Safety Expert, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no major problems with the movement of the Azafate on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to service on planes.
Even here you don't have the assurance that the turbulence will come and that the saffron can be hit on your head."
"However, if the bus suddenly stops the physical laws are valid.
The same as in an urban bus or tram.
The safety of the saffron must be resolved by the internal regulations of the carrier," he says, and he also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier offering the saffron service.
He employs 200 in it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, at the time you have the impression that the saffron post is risky, then I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
It would save even expenses," he says.
In the interests of security is the reason that Asiana lacks saffron on her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which runs a small line compared to SA.
"We have no saffrons, we are against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A Tragedy So Much Happened
In the accident of the line joining Naples, a young Pilsen saffron died who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably rotated from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, struck the front right.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the Azafata were sold.
"These places are not possible to book for long-distance connections, they're blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the judgment on the compensation of the girl's family but will wait for the financial expenses on the culprit's side as well.
Law Reform?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision to the movement of the saffron on the bus in which for a year, thirty experts have been working on a group of the Ministry of Transport.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusion.
They do not devote too much to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile during the march," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of saffrons to be an important threat to the safety of passengers", concludes spokesman Hanzelka, that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
The hope of Dusseldorf is supported in Frankfurt
In the letter from the West LB Board of Directors for its employees, there is no need for great words.
By merging the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank you can form 'a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group', as the written statement states, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the `competence block' with sustainable profit capacity, would enter that business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for further mergers in the area of regional banks.
That is how you understand the text, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just like the West LB used to be under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the federal institute for the surveillance of financial services which has recently made clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also from Frankfurt, there is much talk about the union of such a kind between the DEKA bank, that Sparkasse customers know about their investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August, let him know that he does not see any meaning in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the Board of Directors of the DEKA, which is now composed of the regional banks and the Sparkassen associations, commissioned the Board of Directors to start negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
In this could be a business in the capital market or some part of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, as is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the area of Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 the situation seemed to be so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhine-Palatinate and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
Only the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against the participation of Helaba in this project.
The other two banks did not find the same language either.
Instead, the Regional Bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began dialogue with the Regional Bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But last Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba Board of Directors, said that he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that, it seems clearer that the union of different public law banks is necessary.
When the Bavarian Parliament elections are being held, the BayernLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Hellaba that doesn't necessarily turn out to be good news.
If pressure continues to merge, Helaba will lack partners to do that.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it has been far better off than the financial crisis of the Stuttgart and Munich real estate.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, avoided co-existence plans with the West LB at the beginning of the year.
In any case, there is only the North LB.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a commercial model that could guarantee the future for the regional banks, to which the Sparco- und Giro-Verband deutsche gave no answers so far.
In the end, you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter from the bank's board of directors it is said that a complete solution would be sought for the whole bank
As you can compare the coexistence between unique parts of the bank with DEKA, that will show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena is assisted by him as her girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5 liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows almost 200 participants from Oktoberfest that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the train station Porta Nuova, tonight at 23:45 three buses depart, towards Munich, the feast of beer, expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are mainly intended for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to its flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial fur lining and glasses with silver colored slippers, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have been coming to Octoberfest, bearing in mind that there are only three excursions this year.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the turn.
spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to Bavarian purity law, sickness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on their way on the highway with the "Brenner" address
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the quiet reigns on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
It stands for Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registration take another break on the 8-way shortly before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group has the expected arrival at 6.30 in the morning in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Mark has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, you'll put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "knowingvisiaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors of the tent of the campaign are opened, that means walking!", he screams at Marco in the morning.
"March!" Go and occupy the back sites in the tent of the campaign.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all with yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, scattered across space!"
A litre of beer, rue Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
Just get out of your place, he'll be busy already!"
Third: "This afternoon at exactly ten and a half you have to get here!" Did you understand?
And now everyone goes to Octoberfest.
One, to mark the road, up the yellow caps on trees, traffic signals and even on a cartel of elections of a large People's Party of Bavaria.
It is desirable to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest which is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There is no exact data on the number of people; it is about 50,000 people who make the trip to the Alps and are desperately entering the tents, 10 percent of them all came especially this weekend in Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistics of the nations present, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite shop of the Italian campaign is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of the Hippo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the federal finance minister Peter Steinbrück only stressed last week.
Well, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking area will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate finance, which is quoted in the DAX index, receives from a consortium of the German banks a credit of one billion to be able to resist turbulence in the market.
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to up to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Royal Estate is going to use has to cast interest.
Money comes as from private banks also from those of public law.
That's why the Depfa subsidiary's losses are.
According to one report, state finance with the money that was provided for long-term projects only financed a short period of time - which is now no longer possible due to lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of the year the bank's capital reserve in cash has fallen by 95 percent, 2,37 million euros, also the share of its own capital has delayed a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared with the same period last year, the continuing income from financial investments and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, the debt-debt revenues and some securities also those of the dissolution of credit-business provisions tended to fall by more than 70 per cent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and many revenues of reimbursements of the restructuring costs of the former Depfa group, as well as interest reimbursement according to the federal tax code and organized business for the consortium companies, the negative balance could cause a deficit of approximately 16 per cent more.
After its privatisation in 1990 the former state financial at the beginning was lost in speculation with industrial loans for the buildings, which served as a reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
Since no money could be made with the financing of State projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and financing of Community projects by private investors and as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hyper Real Estate has to make depreciations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of losses and profits of the group, it is said very imprecisely.
It's a fact that dividends have been canceled.
By 2007 they were cancelled to two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa the Royal Estate Hypo became a major state and financial financial asset in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own the customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credits essentially dropped because banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the Royal Estate Hypo needs almost EUR 50 billion to finance a portion of the Defa's credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hippo Real Estate report, the bank covers the need for group financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international monetary markets that are now essentially not capable of functioning"
Other sources say that thanks to this money, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the HIGH Royal Estate Board, explained that the HIGH Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the federal financial services surveillance institute (BaFin) are based on the basis that the competitiveness of the Royal Estate Group is now assured.
That has to wait for the shareholders and bank creditors.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even conceivable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
But the case cannot be ruled out.
I heard that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvency, so temporary salvation can also reassure at least concerned people.
The price of action fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts are almost unchanged, courses of loans according to the position in the property register clearly tend to fall.
Affected are mainly the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hippo and rightly the loans whose maturitys exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the bank crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hippo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are under-affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime they can start the amortization of pensions in the long run.
Or something is going to happen, which is not likely to be imagined - the financial crisis is going to be over in the next 15 months.
But by seeing the cross news about partial statization, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleeping, breaking their heads on the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still put the end point and use the transfer into new account of the losses for future tax payments of compensation benefits on change.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at the High School in Tajikistan, the girls started laughing: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows Mangas' word - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I go by train 40 minutes to Highschool Tacibana.
Alone had to find the way, luckily I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not set as rigorously as in my home in Baja Saxonia.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had come to introduce myself.
Besides, I'm not a person who talks very freely in the public, especially in a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt of my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black shoes of skin.
Well, so dressed I put myself to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
I was very happy at this time because I had been studying this language for two years now.
All 31 girls in the class have sewn, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I quickly slipped off on my site.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really robbed.
Everyone talked at once, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then at the recreation everyone pulled out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - is something else than boring pieces of German bread.
He had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu-mass meat.
In most cases I have no idea what this is like in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of wet plums in the salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools bandages are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bandage made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it in hopes of getting to know him better during a recreation.
That's what I read in my Manga Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?", my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always said:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
Finally, I've been preferring to read Mangas for years.
To better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a weakness for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a harsh, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here although Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Also rats have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling danger flees, why are you also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can it be controlled if they, acting like us, feel the same way?
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years, the contributions of famous scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or someone else could prove it so far, even though we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all the human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and generally about consciousness, we enter the unknown area because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as the other animals: the dead is done, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from what some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contaminate our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include the associated circuits by the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in the short memory and the executive functions that lead conduct).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Given at least the aspects of our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in the linguistic nature of man: As most of his experience is united with the tongue, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even if the consciousness would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of the animals, created anyway, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, does not allow it to be measured because it has special hardware, nor does it allow it to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the consensual experience, but at the same time there is another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short-term primate memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing is rather to neutral correlations of consciousness than to causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what's the result of that for the sensations?
I owe the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated which is responsible for that, the same as with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex that distinguishes primates and above all man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature continue classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for body feelings and brain trunks, as Jaak Pankseep thinks, but focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their feelings.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against that, but I don't think it's likely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like they are afraid, maybe that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control if rats and men behave in a similar way?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, then because it's afraid?
I am of the opinion that the likeness of behaviour does not yet prove the likeness of experience.
That's true that the neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have brain stems like that, but the cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to try it for men: How can it be tested for rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also the cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposed to differ fundamentally from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as it is measured by rats and men.
Since I don't investigate the tongue and the consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I don't see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward rather than work permanently with no results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platini: grace deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said that the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of Ukraine's ability to organize Europe's championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is much to do."
The hours of construction and reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries are covered.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to do work at great speed," said the president of a Ukraine Grigorij Surkis association.
"UEFA won't take our eyes off us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs in the first division were condemned due to manipulation in descent to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's Counterattack Infuriated
She wanted to promote a new film, she spoke in an interview about private life - and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adult.
He's angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses in the former pair of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after her divorce.
The reason for the disclosure of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard how often Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version," said the 54-year-old man to "New York Daily News."
Among other things it is very "sorry" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will remember in public the pain and the changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan after his divorce lives alone, Quaid is newly married and recently is twins' papa.
And so he ends with his statements, pointing out, "No matter how my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay."
Prices for plane tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, air tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany were made cheap up to 50 percent.
Flight tickets and overnight stays in hotels were once again cheap - this is the result of a study by the vendor of travel services and the financial services of American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a major change in the second half.
After prices on the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays on many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe averaged 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices have already dropped to 3.6 percent comparing last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause that "the interests of U.S. tourists in travel decreased."
The decline in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices increased to 26.3 percent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first quarter the prices of plane tickets also showed the upward trends:
Due to the increase in the prices of kerosene, travellers of the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June the prices of the plane tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, dropped on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany price change was more remarkable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, in the second half they decreased to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for national flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of price change is on the one hand the rise in the weak economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the travel market with the plane the demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty which liberalises the trafficking of aircraft between the United States and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankrupt - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him is not yet going to make the tenth goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of the player of the national selection Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to make a goal.
All that he meant exactly by reacting to what happened, he could clearly read it from his lips.
I just knew you were right.
"We need a second goal," silbaba Hermann Rieger at the cabin entrance of Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over, and most of the people were again in their places.
Rieger was almost three decades physiotherapist of HSV, enjoying great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why your request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded his head and raised his fingers in a sign of nocturnalness.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the main coach in Hamburg.
His order was the same: Go, the second goal!
But that was not done.
"It wasn't all nice to see today," added Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard also had wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petri (11) with its head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
This Monday, the SV in Hamburg is going to be 121 years old.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky on the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It provides that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the speed of the alloy than to the dominance of its HSV.
The quipo with its obliged players late like the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the greedy Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but still the quipo cannot shine with their successes.
"We need more of the feeling and the dribbling," Jol demands.
After the defeat of the vote
The Wall Street spreads fear.
The first news about the failure of the bank rescue package dropped the Down Jones at 700 points for a certain period.
That was the loss of the biggest points for a day in his history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
About 20:30 one of the most important barometers in the world quoted a 5 percent deficit in 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and stayed in 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser at the Dow Jones were American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs' shares lost almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a great investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The rescue plan plans to make available resources to purchase so-called "podride" mortgage shares.
But the sum is going to be paid by blow but step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the receipts of stock options for financial associations that can be charged during the course development to reduce the financial burden of the state box.
Action courses in Europe and the US continue to fall
One billion aid for banks in Europe and the United States does not reassure investors.
The course of the actions of the large German bank Hippo Real Estate is low and has a negative influence on the Dax.
Despite the rescue of the financial market projected by the state, the US index Dow Jones continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of the Hippo Real Estate and the Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the saving actions of the federal government and private banks, the actions of Munich's real estate finance a period of time lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6000 points and scored a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5,839 units.
Around the world, financial markets have suffered a fall.
The opening of the Wall Street Day in New York began with remarkable losses.
Investors fear that the US bailout of $700 billion is not enough to give impetus to financial markets.
In the first hour after opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent until it remained at 10,809.25 points.
The House of Representatives of the United States wanted to vote on the draft salvation, the Senate vote may be the first of October.
Also the other European balls knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia the Japanese main index Nikkei after benefits fell to 1.26 percent in 11,743.61 units.

After the announcement of capital expansion the shares of Arcandor lost in the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourist consortium announced that holdings in Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark Matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion to researchers: Dark Matter has influenced the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so right.
The "Ulysses" space probe spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are warming up now threatens a cold death.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, anomaly during gravitational assistance to maneuvers, has caused confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes while they get an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave by 100 percent as expected according to the venerable law of gravitation.
They're more frequent with speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
Physicians could not explain this effect until now.
It was called anomaly during gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's General Relativity Theory that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the U.S. physicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study solemnly believes now as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what the astronomers left in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be the Dark Matter which may also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
She supposedly has the attraction force and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, the Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of the rescue.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during liberation.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations have already begun.
The Germans always fall again at the point of attention of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
As a matter of fact, European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
That is why the same information presents Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news of liberation at the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'Now we control their health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, reports Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the hostages were released: According to the description of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was just "receiving hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, the Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them detained in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to deliver the German wife to one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the report the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be arrested until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Stepfather abuse "leaded to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by their stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Royal Truro Court, through an investigation, knew that he regularly had attached his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court knew that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
During the time the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working on a pub.
After his divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to Cornwall.
Her daughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Ms. Randle, who had spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some of Mrs. Rande's friends had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "resent her life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that was concluded by saying, "I used to tie her up and blindfold her.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a frightening experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, it is that if she hadn't done it, the question probably wouldn't have ended in the courts."
And he added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother there was abuse on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip by the Ministry of Defence, left two documents highly classified on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before it was delivered to the police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention of delinquency.
The BBC correspondent for the Frank Gardner Defense said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguard of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of over £80,000 after the rescue/salvation of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
In fact, the Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million bank savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the savings money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humbling" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be reimbursed after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest due on the internal market is assumed to be charged to the 700 financial companies holding deposits each year.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in this issue.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called upon to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will be £450,000 in 2009.
This means that societies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Trade Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less cautious."
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options there are for protecting construction societies and their members in front of what might be a relevant price," Mr. Cole added.
Interest gained in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, this will be a full year of interest payable, which may almost double.
As the companies of construction mutual organizations and as there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk rose by five pence per litre
The inhabitants of Jersey Strait will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence the liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and then the investigations carried out by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves if they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the milk price had increased before February was 2002.
The former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected the bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
Its defenders said that the court did not grant him bail on charges of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several charges of corruption against you.
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail early this month.
The return of Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the militaryly supported government grant him full freedom.
The correspondents say that while he was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of his release are or whether he will be able to remain free when he returns to Bangladesh.
Your lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina claiming that she could not obtain bail because she was already being treated abroad on parole," said lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"Let's file an appeal against the Supreme Court's order."
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after 17 October, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, supported by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to take advantage of a recent campaign of anti-polymyelitis vaccination because of the violence of the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesperson said that despite the promises made by the Taliban that would not have attacked or impeded thousands of staff while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision forcing the company to reduce its participation in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its participation by 17.9% in ITV below 7.5 per cent.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests impede competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, in buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV participation raised doubts about the independence of ITV, and encouraged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including the head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and was a disproportionate remedy, particularly because BSkyB said, it would have handed over its voting rights.
New investigation into the recruitment of state lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a Special Prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the management's performance.
The report criticized the White House officials, legislators and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Several allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But later it was assumed that lawyers had not been evaluated worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had been working on the persecution of Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute legal cases for the government
and can be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under the pressure of layoffs, resigned from his position.
A number of other staff members of the Department of Justice did the same.
The Attorney-General's report is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and stresses how he had a "primary responsibility" for layoffs, which "abded" his position of leadership and was "notably collaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush's former collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epic of Meat Loaf of Much Honor
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special prize next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said that getting this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay Group is taking the nominations for this year's awards and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that go beyond time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained for about nine years in the classifications and came to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation due to cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it appeared that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous ones, others simply service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of the Primiera Calle – before I found the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than an active road.
There's no sign.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings at the Primera Calle
that wants to refurbish Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-time neighbours who commented they were delighted by the road slammed simply because it is one of the last remnants of the past of the block before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in possessing it.
At the meeting of the Community Venture Committee for Land Use this month, representatives of Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring that the street remain in the city, requested a new plan to be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, the District Manager of the Community no.3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to guarantee public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month's meeting
but Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that despite the company wanted to use the street, not necessarily wanted to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned alley and the possibility of making it a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Committee on Preservation, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is the development of property rather than the management of it.
Compared to its more coloured surroundings, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne’s large estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps better known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on Ramones album cover "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, Ramone's manager, who took out the photograph in November 1976.
"I was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the East Village’s bourgeoisie, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest as they are, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically without change, a king of the city that should be protected.
Jérémie Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk in the history of the city on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little narrow and not out, dark also for the day and marked by doors of oxidized iron warehouse and counter-windows, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now it hosts a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty bottle of beer about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but they suggested that it could be cleaned.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its present state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling the Hispanic voters is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are the example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-Americans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transition bilingual education" for English-English students.
However, the issue open to Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English, is effective in eradicating the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
More than a third of students, many of whom have just arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of the fourth year students, has been positively evaluated in the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent has dominated the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that Mr. Obama favored.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competences and does not tolerate any excuse attitude.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of the Sixth Street, the school's approach to English education to students is in the "total immersion".
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who have arrived from Mexico and that, if you come into class 12 months later, you would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating by other schools with large populations of Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubts about the response, but the idea of the politicians of your party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been defenders of bilingual education) and their same constant support for bilingual education obscures Mr Obama's prediction of the response.
While it is true that immigrants must learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the question by letting people stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English
and instead, he said, "you must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should consider carefully the models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls sharply after the renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Raw oil shares decreased by 7 percent to $99.80 in the morning negotiations in the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before going back again because of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety was taken over by investors, once again on Monday, despite the Congress leaders who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the biggest in history.
The news was clouded by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that took place in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts in Barclays Capital said that, on the frenetic weekend, negotiations leading to the rescue agreement "do not seem to have been able to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected to lower the demand for commodities, including oil.
"The prospects for global equity, interest and exchange rates will become increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this infection.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread worldwide and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, such as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and forecasting the reduction in oil and gas prices by 20 percent by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
After having spent the last eight seasons, more than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things developed on the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without annotation into a game of deinflation.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with persistence under the shadows of the clouds.
At this moment it happened that the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranues Coles achieving a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect omen for one afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one of them when a cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were in the prey, the defense of the Cardinals mistreated the Kurt Warner quarterback.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a running shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to blame Warner.
In the last shift, the faults bound by Bowens might have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a definitive 34-0.
These are the bigger points that Jets never did in a room.
To Team Coach Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second quarter much more than the third.
They've won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebslelassie Rested Leads Your World Record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has proved that many consider him the greatest runner in history, exceeding his own world record at the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the race of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the comfortable race in plain at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebselassie has established the world record number 26 in an impressive length race so it has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the counter-lock race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming - in retrospect - that air pollution aggravated its problems with asthma.
Instead, he went for a run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using on average a few cutters 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebselassie told the journalists that he had suffered cramps two weeks before and that he had lost a week's training.
It is clear that the suspension left him fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told the journalists.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
The athlete has been subject to some criticisms - especially in Kenya, the Afro-Eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on the pacemakers as if it were a career track, and putting the record ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, on the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after their pace marks decreased.
But just before three miles away, Gebselassie took a last push to separate from Kwambai, who ended second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived in third place at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also took part in the Beijing Games so it was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and establish her best record staff in almost five minutes on the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculus race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second square at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya ended from third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proof of colour life
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometres from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the Afro-American experience remain very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and place of the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and a prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – also doing it a tourist stage by including it in the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resistive to share their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and does not know what is going on."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the race issue, many remain cautious in front of the outside.
"We are very cautious about how our history is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of the Black claim and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black South - sometimes despised, others praised - that was born of slavery in America.
It's no wonder, if the residents here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "They Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road running through the center of Florida often forgotten inside the history of blacks and human drama.
Having concrete face both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road on the left hand," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, care for Howard Miller, as he can just read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells all kinds of drinks and anything goes with transitional rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston puts in relation Eatonville with the autonomous government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized quoting men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without prior notice in a big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides herself in dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People are always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin follows.
But she added, swinging in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only colored woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large memorial ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think your contribution to the world or your inheritance was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography by Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-road road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main street of the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, inter alia, had put an end to it relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mixture led to hatred about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys were going through the city throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next door," said Mr. Franklin.
"They also killed a girl once.
They threw him into a car wench."
In a letter from 1955, Mrs. Hurston wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the segregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the trust of their young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - they used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because I was white - there's a cultural gap there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with craziness, trust and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, a acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroducing her into American canons.
The road project came right at the time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was again under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put on what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd said more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
Outside town people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (bearing the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, about a refurbished and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, you can sometimes feel like in a street in the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A prior permission is needed to do most of the interviews, and some things - like the murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men who work in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, there has also been a higher level of birth pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, worker, foolish and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of the nephew of 18-year-old Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, who planned to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the kiosks and the gigantic TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the bee nest offices that are above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York each day face the worst "bad office day" since the fall of 1929.
Girls for home delivery keep resounding their metal carts for tea through the sidewalks and carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between buildings of loaded apartments, as well as human mules, with 50 eccentric shirts hanging on a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their food to carry out in the morning, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees still wait while queued for their bagel to the vendors' carts, and it is impossible to find a taxi between 4 and 5 p.m. on the day of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although it had calculated the time required for the operation to coincide with the calm of the end of the afternoon in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw your cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where the customers of all life order their check counters, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's large stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was informed later by Starr, my "trusted personal banker," and they were queued for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places from where they had been switched, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had drawn their money from so-called savings associations (a little like a building company), from credit unions and savings boxes from their home city whose branches only work within the state of belonging, and that they say treat customers as well as their family.
During last year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, broke into bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers headed to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with some savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers in the offices and shops that stood before me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank that is considered a safe haven, which is what most of the rescues on Wall Street are doing.
Ordinary people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the telephone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her executive director of a distressed look, Dick Full, commented on the matter familiarly as if they complained about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, Fifty and something in uniform from my block of apartments, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my purchases at the store.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings on money market funds.
The switch is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Muslim graves desecrated at the time Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated to the far-right party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present to the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signals representing mosques with a red line passing through.
The police are blaming extreme right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend as the political parties on the far right made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The delinquents sprayed Jewish symbols, such as David's Star on some of the graves, but researchers think this may have happened by trying to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was somehow related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of desecration, which came to the Muslim religious as Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that captured almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigrant vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headkerchiefs and burkas, and also expressed opposition to foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties intend to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the country's strongest political block, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent ' s police issued a ban on travel abroad last Thursday after the magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter ' s previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by counsel Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Judicial Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September at the Judge of the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad like France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as he was under the registration of sexual offenders.
He has to inform the authorities in case he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent's police said he wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible place of Glitter in the county.
A police spokesperson from Kent said, "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A police spokesperson from Kent said, "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because here we have systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we work in close collaboration to monitor the behavior of the sex offenders registered in the county and minimize any risks that may exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3, on August 22, and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied his order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for the possession of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, calmed down and rejoiced to know that they had forbidden Glitter to travel to France and Spain.
"Capto al maestro out of scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no steering wheels, no stars' suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
The artist aside.
The other one, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, at such moments outside the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, neglected because they are not going to go out to the scene.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flamenca Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, more every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, when seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These portrayed people "on the street" are artists able to convey in the scene passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the big flamenco."
With the taste of the "Cante de las Mines" festival Bauer started in 1,997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plaque camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical basis of the image, confirming modernity, idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of dance, song or touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with what is essential, with the duende that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, set up this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits displayed in the sample.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran sportsmen" ("SportART Project").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter an instant into their lives, whether long or short.
I think inside the photograph the portrait is the most difficult gender.
You meet or face people, characters, you sometimes don't even know, or they leave you just a few minutes to be able to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is displayed in the El Fotómata Gallery, located on the 20th street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda of Hercules, where you can visit until 16th October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel she writes is "a fear"
It is set in places that are not yet known and it deals with unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to moving forward the new project in which he works, a novel that has as protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through Amazonia.
He always preferred the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that occupies him today "is a fear" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If I were wise, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that he's seen going through the city of the Acueducto for four days to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the word festival and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of "Our mutual friend" by Dickens, filled the opening of the theatre Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a delivered audience who was made very short the time when Peruvian, with a wonderful memory and great dose of humor, reviewed how he was born in him his literary vocation, derived from the "extrodinaria adventure" of the "place to read" and "live more than he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined manner" to supplement his "lack of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and reactioning much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more inconformity", so he asked the writers to "do not give up on frivolity" and "assum with responsibility" his vocation.
Climatology melts Pozoblanco's fair that also remains out of areas
The celebration of areas closing the subscription of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the announced rowers that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
Thus, the company, in accordance with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather conditions have begun with this fair, since at last two of its three celebrations have not been able to be celebrated.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
The cartel was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a prison of Castilblanco.
So, only Friday was celebrated.
In it, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and left his shoulder, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante went out with greetings and an ear, which granted more the tendons than his tore.
That is, worse still was El Juli, who passed through Los Llanos' body with no pain or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief farm, the blouse of a large part of the public was won.
They jump a control in Álava in a van with two thousand kilos of hash
Five minus ten in the morning.
Control of Ertzaintza traffic in the municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Agents lift up the two occupants of a van and they take the flight.
Its cargo, more than two tons of hash, was not like stopping.
The officers were persecuted and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., as reported in a statement by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been accused of drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials from the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control at N-1, at their passage through the municipal term of Armiñón.
They were available to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, sped up, and the control jumped.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later in the archery, when their two occupants docked to flee the race through a forested area.
The Ertzains finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hash that they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hadhish burdens, so they transferred it to police units for comprehensive inspection and weighing the drug.
In addition, the officials verified that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so a criminal offence of falsification of public documents has also been charged to the arrested.
Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as has been said, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A. A. J., was transferred to police units to carry out the relevant proceedings and will be available to the court within the next few hours.
Stop the actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effects of some medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers trying to leave her parking in Montecito, according to the magazine People, a spokesman for the California Road Patrol.
The witness has detailed that about 4.30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping thoroughly the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to pull the car out of the parking lot forward and backward, and in going back passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently had not initially recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, who was partially blocking the road.
"It seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was shown cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to the first sight of the officers, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of a substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison about 7 p.m. although he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a treatment clinic in Arizona where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Flames urges the Andalusian UI federation to assume its competences in the Silva case
The coordinator-general of IU and Member of United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of training that will have to take a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of the City Council of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of dealing in favour of family members.
"I am a very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to take over its competences," he said about the action that the party has to take with which so far it is a councillor in the Seville constitution.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "IU has always defended that such matters have the highest degree of transparency".
In the same line he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public positions".
'Sangre de May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried "to illustrate the stream of characters and social analysis" which he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, has today explained during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide list of interpreters.
Sangre de May, with a film above two and a half hours, debuts this Friday in the cinemas, to become a future miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours of duration.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this film "a dream of childhood", which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to film a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, something that he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget which the Community of Madrid has provided in its entirety is a "one-time opportunity" for Garci to sit with the décors and the appropriate clothing the portrait of "an atolondrada Spain that was wrong in the chief for which to fight, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had such funding as that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of Sangre de May - so he has not been able to film some scenes shown in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career.
For this reason, the director of Return to Start, has focused on what is his usual form of work, the setting up with the actors, with whom he usually tries before starting the shooting and those he doesn't casting, because he seems "humbling" and considers that "part of the director's profession is to go to the theater and to the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in Sangre de May repeat to his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranñaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Sangre de May itself, Seven tables of French billiard and the finally selected one, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is to be made known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you conform to making a more film," explains Garci after over 30 years of professional trajectory.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the sevillana dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevillana dancer will honor a sevillana dancer as well.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in Eastern dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corse that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a danstic and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character and it seemed amazing."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
His dance titles have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a pretty, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will again sing to Isabel in one in his shows, as he did in that of "The Open Door"; and with Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who her student was.
"Matilde makes Tortola older, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have accepted to act in my work and I feel very honored for it."
The assembly also has the musical composition and guitar composition of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi of Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who makes the role of the eternal companion of these types of artists who were divas in all its extension, and who are always in love with them."
The work also includes in some way the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially at the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it's from those women who have an enormous influence at a given time and now no one knows and much less puts into value their work," says Bayón.
The show will start today at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope Theatre in Vega.
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is framed as part of the activities scheduled by the Council of Culture of the Board of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress which has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of the Nobel and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That light shoot", which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the various Andalusian provinces, will be planned to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
In addition, the Culture Council of the Board of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Recent poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de Malicia", and gives the idea of the disappearance of American cinema, and from all over America, to the striking idea that Newman has gone away.
Look how hard it was to give them an Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And that he knew he was very sick.
Even so, it's been a beating for all of us.
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond all expression, and now I've lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
No one was afraid to do the ridiculous or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When so hard is time and without virtue men and very few beings that admire you remain, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and trueness.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost and won causes, from the foundation to fight the drugs created in honor of his first-born overdose to his home and organic food brand.
All a gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of Hollywood barria admiration without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that he didn't die a man but an age.
Another Englishman, director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was no less than the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared call Newman his biggest inspiration.
"He has left us the very high list for everyone," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the requirement of probity high and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once, but then he was married 50 years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful when he surely had the opportunity not to be.
"But why am I going to eat burgers out of the house, if I have steak?", he used to joke himself.
In heaven, he has the pride that his daughters on earth match their fans, something unusual in America.
"Of all the great roles that he interpreted, of none was as proud as of the devoted husband, loving father, solicit grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that they celebrate Olympics in Madrid and, after the failure of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race was called it, and in my opinion it has been the worst career with much in which I have been.
A lot of disproposals that, of course, if taken into account as an assessment and I would examine, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go in parts and from the beginning.
The dispurposes begin with the collection of the backbone, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn't seem bad to me, but if they already get you to give it all (including chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here only made you go to pick up the back (first aim, go only for that) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the T-shirt (second unpurpose, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or have they decided to buy only small T-shirts with less cloths and cheaper for the crisis?
Well, things like these are a minor compared to those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes lasted the wait, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as was expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened to wait for more than 40 minutes, which was combined with conatos of popular rebellion and assault on the cassette.
I think about 500 people are probably going to have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, it didn't work out correctly.
Of course, if you asked me about the perfect career, this one wouldn't enter my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At MIT Microsoft's Emerging Technologies conference, a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company campus) paying attention to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they wear - and hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and tells him he'll take care of him soon.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
The company now has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we have talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and you won't have as many programs associated.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the essentials instead of carrying commercial trash, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
All a finding taking into account that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, as well as the software.
When Google Chrome got out on the net, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many correctly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is the necessary layer for Hardware and Software to understand.
It fulfills the same role as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear but one must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half the applications that come into the system for?
That's less.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its services online and that they are finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft's employee rest rooms in Redmond early in the month.
In the refreshment machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, there was also a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come in early 2009 but in the end, rather by pulling to 2010.
In Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is every day more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore her on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio used to play one on Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', like Al Pacino in 'El Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the gay muscular parish.
And if we start to list stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that sharp-necked moustache force that raised weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men's underwear shirt in cotton, strapped and without sleeves.
The 'tank', which call the English speakers, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles points out above all others.
First of all, by his humbling name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport because he gets his name, as the legend goes, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' highlights others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And pay attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its top tanks.
It also includes college sweatshirts, back boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine T-shirts, babes, mini shorts...
Dresses designed for comfort underwear.
Although it's a shame to leave them as underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry."
His huge resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion that the company Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish house is sponsoring.
Warm and shy, win in the short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that we have designed my sister Penelope and I for Mango in this new fall-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
On what basis is your new collection for Mango in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the '50s and '60s, so we made a lot of references.
Then, I really like to lose myself in a city and watch the women dress up, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot of it.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, it all unites and they have a lot of ties in common.
I liked my clothes from an early age; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to huddle up my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to look after my clothes.
You know that dancers like to do our stylists for classes and rehearsals, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you get dressed is when you actually find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've met the 30s not long ago, have you been in crisis?
What's up.
I feel better than ever, I like the 30s.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I'm asked by the body and I want to be a young mother; this I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're waiting for several stars you rolled up last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to them seeing the light.
I, that I am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, all I want for now and of course, can't be.
I'm looking forward to 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the tomb of Christ'.
See how they look to you...
A few days ago, you started a walk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went up a bridge to model.
Simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial parade for his organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we displayed - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - was inflated to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that I, who know her, would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm keeping that good part where she's involved.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to do the pine, as well.
To benefit women from the third world, what is needed.
Drivers re-incided by alcoholism must install 'alcohol'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the drunk vehicle from starting, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the State Attorney General ' s Office, according to which it is a pilot project with a duration of one year.
Its purpose is to reinstate the driver, so he will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the experience of the Attorney-General for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Fundación Instituto Tecnologique para la Seguridad del Car (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more than once for driving drunks take the car again.
Alcohol will avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of air alcohol spired and prevents the car from booting if the driver does not blow abtes; or when an alcohol concentration is detected it is higher than the one allowed.
Its cost is higher than 1,000 euros and would run on behalf of the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
The measure relates to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing such behaviour before it results in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be carried out on a regular basis, and yet the necessary criminal reform requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial way, although it has already been installed experimentally in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the PSOE which proposes to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the time scheduled for the program, it landed in the Hangar presidential of Mexico airport Benito Juárez DF the Spanish air force aircraft on which the Princes of Asturias traveled.
The sun was rising but its rays still forced to use the hand visor mode to see the real couple get off the plane.
On foot to the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street, if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that hour... she's from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar attached to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marine soldiers who interpret the rescue of honours.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, melana in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual peep-toes, perhaps had told her that in the DF it threatened storm.
They present a smile and a tail stop the photographers before passing into the room where the official committee awaits.
At the door of the hotel where you are staying, one of the four majors of the city, awaits you a reporter from the Mexican television.
The best award equipped with fashion
There is likely to be no place in the world most appropriate to present a fashion prize, that Paris and possibly not have a live designer more exquisite and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new talents of fashion.
It is awarded a prize of €300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs at Mango's window in the 54th issue of the Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and almost cried out of emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one's in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the gala presidential table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Nati, with his heart broken with grief and making heart-pies, for his brother's recent death, put on a coat of the House and some of ELAH's dressings, which cut the breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a canyon of almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his homage dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the baron of Rotchil, without jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with his pants and shirt - of his own design - and for dinner turned into a long black sexy dress, got excited when on the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they taught us the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a large fold amago.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the walk through the palace dependencies, but previously taught us on his child's mobile phone photos.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that moves by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously requested that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, here's life.
1001, the number anti-stress
There are no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And in case it's little, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The awakening almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7:00 a.m., but it's still worse to imagine getting involved in the bustling pace that imposes the present life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection with the working world.
No, the number rises to, nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book a whole menu of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the libraries of the hand of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' undermines such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Speak Sleeping
Some kids talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very often and tell us something that has happened the day before, but to children who are talking about being asleep.
The first time it happens, you'll get scared, but it really doesn't matter.
It's a benign alteration of the dream that's called sleepwalkers.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They often relate to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (getting to sleep) or sleepwalking, but it doesn't have to be that way.
As we have already mentioned, they may also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation.
However, it is a phenomenon not studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
You may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or otherwise (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check whether there is any issue that is generating much anxiety and gives him out of this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, therefore it has no treatment, except that it is associated with another alteration of the dream that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress box).
What can be done is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid TV shows or series that are either of fear or a little violent.
With very nervous children who are very difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a calmer dream.
Once the nightmares appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes you should consult or find out what it is that causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most usual), do not be tempted to do an interrogation to convey information to him.
You won't get anything, because being asleep is not aware of how to organize your thinking.
You will also hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, with which much care how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern finally!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory in his field after a long period of scarcity.
Without making a good match, the team created many goals and was able to make a goal to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting at which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to rock the squad with a shot away, Illhaeusern was going to take the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from far, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
On the front, we did not allow the camper centre to pass and left only Riahi in attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of goal of Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illousiens with the goal of Marais, well located to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the greedy Illousiens will not be able to taste their happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave their teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven Illinoisns who went a little back to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after a major butterfly, the ball passed very close to the cross-field.
Sarkozy finds the furious fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will ride for Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and hope " to come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general board of the " crisis committee " set up by Breton fishermen to achieve measures to deal with the increase in oil prices, which marks a record when reaching EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elíseo David Martinon, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses to be competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors " .
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on a firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, operations were carried out to slow down the circulation in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused nearly 10 km jams.
The sports port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-Isle have not been stopped.
"A filter barrier" has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors had already shown their determination on Monday by burning, by raking the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks in the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Donges refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting of this Wednesday that will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to consider Tuesday in the development of the movement and in its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris " , for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a gas oil price of less than €0.30 per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two Men and a Destiny " has died because of a cancer, at the age of 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes saluted the film legend and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that it poses in the world economy.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains his forecasts of deliveries for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, reaffirmed Embraer's president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian builder trusts a lot in the Chinese market particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would attempt to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group, which has been seized from shocks from the American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay its $85 billion loan, according to the edition of the Financial Times Sunday.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this newspaper is precise.
The AIG Board of Directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 % participation in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, pursues the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly liquidate its loan of 85 billion which was granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the US authorities take 80 % of its capital, dilute it with the appropriate proportion of the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historical fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 per cent, i.e. a loss never seen in the 800-point Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq was 9.14 per cent.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded last September 17, 2001, or the day on which the exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, with technological dominance, declined 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the expanded Standard & Poor's index 500 to 8,81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the definitive closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives denied the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two Republicans out of three rejected their plan.
"That is not a good sign sent to the market, which the Congress sees as unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of the FTN Financial.
"This shows how far the market had this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days will come "too late".
" If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over the relief (the U.S. Central Bank, the Network N.) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, Chief of Economics and Finance of Global Insight.
And highlighting the sense of urgency, " every day that passes is announced the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, Mrs. Piegza said.
After the crash in Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of the banking activities of Wachovia by their rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis dramatically accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets face "not only a crisis in the United States but a global crisis," added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market went up dramatically.
The yield of the treasury bonus at 10 years fell by 3,632 %, against 3,827 % on Friday afternoon, and the bonus at 30 years, by 4,161 %, against 4,357 % on-the-Day.
Obama, winner during the first TV duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House took place another one to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the general barracks of Republican and Democrat campaign proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel which has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though honorable, was not "sweet enough" to allow him to slow down in the polls to five weeks in the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama five points of advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), thinks it's the Democrat who went well.
Among the indecisive voters, who count, Obama won 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them won McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his member of his own candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts," but Bill Clinton says this weekend.
Septagenario McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "ingenuity" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge needed to be president," he also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in republican television commercials.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Undisturbed, it was concise and precise.
It enhanced its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television advertising that criticized the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans."
" During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, denounced Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a cold rain.
He did not pronounce the words "average class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favours Obama, who is considered by Americans as the most capable person to save the economy on the brink of precipice.
" Next week could be a decisive episode," he estimated, yesterday, the influential and Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's " good economic instincts " with Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final result of eight years of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that it would nevertheless come to reduce the taxes of 95 per cent of the United States despite the oversales on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that the realization of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies was her first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
Prudents, both candidates avoided issues relating to the $700 billion financial saving plan (EUR 470 billion) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents manifested last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislatures in advance.
Hundreds of Belarusians met on Sunday afternoons since the closure of the polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: " the dictator, he has to resign " .
Some acknowledge that they have not voted: "Why, since they will do what they want with my vote," says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that made foreign observers good in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean for observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
" We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of votes," Iouri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroup of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change, points out Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our home, is the executive power.
If some Members of the opposition come into parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
" But your entry to parliament may mean appearances on television, meetings in the regions and bills."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts against Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition feared that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process did not recognize the validity of the vote.
It stresses that participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26 % of voters in Minsk) favored manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections? Ask the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be at most five Members of the opposition to parliament, who are better suited to power."
The silence of the night returns again in the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulated on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday his 10th anniversary of his foundation, and his president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Québec has once again been one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, it reconquered the public's confidence that it had been seriously vacillated by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and with the public's discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994 under the chairmanship of Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer occur.
While Judge Krever was late in presenting his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
After making many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence " before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94 per cent of the people of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "trust is something extremely fragile " .
Since its inception, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow's disease in Europe, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
So we support one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious illness can emanate from it, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive technique of HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleid acid tests that allow direct detection of the presence of the virus in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, which were based on the tests used so far.
Tests of nucleid acid allowed shortening the period between the moment the person has been infected and the moment the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
Thus, we substantially reduce the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements allowed the risk of AIDS to be significantly lowered by blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will pass more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV comes through a blood product.
I believe that one can now receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without concern," says the head of Héma-Québec's management.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It must be constantly vigilant ", pursue Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Québec must also provide for sufficient supplies.
" The needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Since more aggressive anti-carcinogen treatments, patients often need red blood cell or platelet injection.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors who regroup on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All persons with good health, aged 18, who meet the eligibility criteria, however, can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 % of the people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory covering the needs of hospitals.
Pearries are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it's hard to convince people to give their blood, but above all to hold them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since the present life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood," Francine Décary is distressed.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the sole public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly regarded as biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We celebrated a few weeks ago, placing in the bank of our thousandth sample of blood from the umbilical cord and is expected to take more than a thousand of these out each year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year ", Dr. Décary needs to describe this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this " , since Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program at all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact on the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semifinals of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a victory for 3-1 (4-3 in fine sum) at the shores of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-finals series, at the Saputo Stadium.
The centercampist Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time with no goal anywhere, the centercampist David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many occasions of goal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who ruined Matt Jordan by the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first game of the game series back and forth, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take it for 4-3, but the Whitecaps got in the semifinals for 5-4.
The impact should be faced at Whitecaps on Friday and next Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Soon – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The three-year Canadian is willing to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn stimulated the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win against free shootings in front of the Panthers of Florida last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this profit, the Tricolor quarter in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave victory by marking the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warn the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the most in the first time, he scored Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
Prime Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to be elected during the partial election today.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force remaining on the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, from Quebec, seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large media such as during the electoral period.
The Prime Minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his schedule was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a "view" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a " new economic space ", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the recent Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister was nevertheless limited to explaining why the North was " a jewel to the immense potential " but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could be more developed in particular is: hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, which is dominated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, five, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamonds " according to Mr. Charest ' s enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France," is our home, is in Quebec.
Not only is it at our house, but it is in us," he insisted, as to show that he was asking for a national founder myth.
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the laughter towards gold in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, specified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line in which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion is presented, I repeat that position on the part of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the passage of the north-west, which will be opened each year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec Ungava party), have already started consultations about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role to play in starting some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting in which " a common vision will be given " .
Northern development would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan " will be agreed, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "view" as one that is in continuity with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded him.
" Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform the challenges into new times of growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed re-baptizing the Beauharnois Central in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made the Bay James our party knew how to forge the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, she invoked another reference, the conservative, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Turning to the topic of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its start-up is planned for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I expect to be there," he confided his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that no elections would be held in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be put into effect this fall, which the law allows.
He stressed that his schedule was nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The General Council of the Week provided the Liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec particularly calls for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
It also wishes Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the great lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had, "we would make progress today," said Mrs. Marois next to her candidate at Jean-Talon (vote that was done today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec's Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper Cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "marriage" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what she says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national that is closed in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It's a government that doesn't take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that were brought against him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and leaves a child-soldier living in inhumane conditions.
The only one who cries out with a false justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to benefit from a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: little cares that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exaggeration.
We still do not realize that, but at this moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when no morals exist anymore: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far wants (what will happen after October 14th?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtue, Law, and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what our country's reputation and dignity was doing.
Mr. Toews shame is caused by this resignation and nothing more.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
On September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J . Garver, vice president and director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world attempted a process of defamation of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution by defamation, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to theirs?
The outcome of the dispute is of little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Black Canada must spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defence and to fight, with very unequal weapons, an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will soften the opposition as well as scare anyone else to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually made by changing ideas and not by beatings.
It was therefore enough for the miner to open her books, her records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and reject requests and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he could ask for a "public" debate by disregarding his views?
According to the vice-president, it seems that this word refers only to lawyers who are well paid and not to all Canadians; it represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does especially because it rejects the brutal way of the miner.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but having as a basis civilized changes of arguments, and not in the context of what many people perceive as persecution-moordity (following the " public debate "), Barrick Gold has just filed a request with regard to the authors of Noir Canada urging them no longer to use this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to hold a debate on facts and interpretations, which form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects who dislike the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under many persecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the university world, but also to the public debate in Canada, and it is high time that governments put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: better control by the elected parties of their implementation, of new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the invested public money, of the new provisions to contain the number of homes that are excluded from payment, as well as a right to control the wages paid to the leaders of the assisted companies.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of the Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had been concluded very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would result in a new failure in the mood of investors.
The last hour that had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, which were late in the negotiations, were more favourable to the agreement, but nevertheless expressing their satisfaction at being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow owners to keep their home and the salary of the leaders of the state-surviving companies.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
He said that the choice to do nothing is not acceptable."
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with the taxpayers' money the dubious debts, assets at risk and invincibles of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a housing bubble that first led to the sinking of mortgage risk credits before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a freeze of liquidity and a ban on banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have left the stagnation since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of the troubled companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to clean up the asperencies for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to take up losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if it seems necessary to the President.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote from Congress.
In exchange for your help, Washington will be able to obtain shares in the relief companies that will benefit from dividends in the event of profits and will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the embargo procedures relating to houses obtained from real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and on cash compensation paid to the leaders of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote by the House of Representatives since today and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all its efforts, it is still not sure that its plan will be adopted.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both by Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Finance Committee of the Chamber, told his constituents that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand " .
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the benefit of taxpayers.”
The Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is an encouraging group in Congress, presented the problems differently, but came to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred economic teachers, among whom three Nobel Prizes, wrote to tell us: we ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention by the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had refused to buy its competitor in bankruptcy since it lost EUR 2 billion (US$2.9 billion) during the U.S. crisis of venture real estate loans.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos yesterday.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that the savers and the families would now appreciate that the times are uncertain."
During this time, across the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank in the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than EUR 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley Bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes so long represented his triumph.
Did the American actor with a charming smile get rid of his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His smell, sensitivity, and an obvious talent would also have removed him from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background corridor!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at 83, due to lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the latest icons in American film from the fast years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, who seemed much and who was long considered as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots one of the glorious faces of American sleep will be born.
No ego measured, last brand of quality.
Because in it, a whole country in love with self-made man, the Pacific war fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the New York Actor's Studio, before winning in theatre, on television and soon in cinema.
This man who militated for civil rights was also the driver who ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him, the secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star also disappear, allergic to the world scandals of the show that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death sparked the vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, while his great roles are intertwined on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art perpetuating movement through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the charming cowboy Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoked his sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone to film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, a delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Hate-marked), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly mangant in the sumptuous film The Sting (El Gulpe), Oscar to the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which he valued in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes with the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during their careers.
Young people know him above all thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977) in Reggie Dunlop, a hockey team coach on orthodox ice.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of Brother Coen.
With a final role of godfather of the Irish Mafia on Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rice was rudied.
Contrary to several movie legends that soon abandoned the career, Newman stayed a lot in the world of the cinema, reporting Hollywood, its golds, its fronts and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and who judges his performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young galan than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed his true, not-so-known sexual sensibility on each side.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of smell and sadness.
" Among the numerous tributes that took place yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former fellow weapon Robert Redford (they had worked together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, deeply saddened: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, the love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his career as a legend, he also hides a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant against Hollywood's excesses.
We'll have seen a lot of his face reigning over the vinagreta sauce boots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, though it began as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to her Foundation for Children in difficulty.
Newman, rather than content with his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: " Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What do they produce in the Zushlag &amp; Co. billing factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing significant damage fraud, in a business way, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, funds obtained in public tenders have been used for their own purposes, often justifying the performance of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the town halls - in their entirety about HUF 65 million - partly stopped in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and in part in the pocket of private persons.
The method, which was also made known to researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the prosecution, most bills were false.
To this end, the Talonaires were obtained in the Józsefváros District market and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that, on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made, was decided among other things on that tour by the Balaton Superior Region where János Zuschlag sent to István Sides.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for his consumption, and these served as a model for making the invoices that they presented among others in the contests of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City of Capital.
These invoices were signed mostly by István Sides and his accomplice András 'ri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports needed to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two bills issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomy center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Pont Egyesület Biztos Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people do not fit at once in that place.
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Foundation Jöv'ert - later called Együtt a Harmadik Évezredert - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill contained one hundred and thirty people.
But the great fancy bill manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed to the food center Pigal Kft. for in the book store of it - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's office - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövört and Hoppá.
The company's manager, Gy the Farkas, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he knew it was fake documents.
"In the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal problems, he did not agree that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which so many people do not belong.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has been out of operation for a long time.
Enthusiast invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest organizes exclusively trips abroad, so that in the cash payment bill they foolishly indicated as service a trip within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency's billing practice.
Moreover - as was known during the investigation - VAT also included in the document, despite the fact that travel outside the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövěért Foundation, since the services of that company were not loaded with 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, besides the hotel employees only extended invoices made by machine, however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "shipper" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecutor's office - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate invoice format, false stamp - it is known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturalis Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehertó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue such invoices.
Nor did counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the Nyiregyháza HIB Kft was in liquidation process, so the liquidation process officer - according to our information - refused to have issued such a document.
They consciously issued invoices
Another group of the manufacturers of false invoices are those who were aware that they should issue fictional invoices.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány , at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták, shipped invoices worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - According to the prosecution - he was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictional bills.
Likewise, Zuschlag and his accomplices collaborated with Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 supplied invoices of approximately HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jöv the Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület association and the Vörösfeny the Egyesület association, with no real economic activity behind it.
There was no movement of capital either, as later the invoices were cancelled but they forgot to record in their documents to this entity.
The following group of false invoice manufacturers includes those who have any connection with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant of the Ukrainian Delta Trio SL manager with a fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of software.
According to the research data, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also issued the company-related documents between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation he shipped on behalf of the company invoices for the Atlas, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány by charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the defendant - they did not get a job.
But he took advantage of these companies, since, at the request of his accomplice, counsel Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for organizations linked to Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for Y-Generáció.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri company to issue fictional bills used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországert presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the competition, they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the competition.
To prevent this from being discovered, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Work Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Arpád Kemecsei had at the Ministry of Education headquarters.
Part of the accused will probably report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor ' s Office - the course of counterfeiting of invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For their confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: What is the point of interest to do so?, perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days even could be offended, since in order to relieve his prison conditions he sought home arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, pass freely or at least can expect the sentence in their own home, he has no possibility for that.
Overhead psychology: Why do we spend more money?
The auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
The neurologists and economists of the University of New York discovered the neurological - economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in a auction and while being examined through the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is a fundamental element to bet more than the other, by losing the game, the operation of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex was intensified.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "auto prize" of the nervous system.
According to scientists, increased betting is explained as a prevention to avoid causing an intense reaction to the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups wagered against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members betted.
The other group, in addition to that, was promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but in case of losing the auction, the group members lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by testing the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group playing "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "gain" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
Those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and risk prevention.
Only the visual neurological methods helped solve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now reach a third explanation" - established Andrew Schutter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Around five hundred million people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infections in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the patients do not know they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are spread in two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and with body moods (sperm, vagina humor, saliva).
It is recommended for travellers to protect themselves by vaccine against virus A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after eating the infected food, manifested by a poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that appear in the skin and white of the eyes jaundice, excrement becomes clear, dark urine and healing can last even two to three weeks.
Annually, one million people die in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that, according to the calculations, only one out of every ten infected is treated pharmacologically.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most of the infected do not know he is ill because this pathological agent gradually destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical control is therefore very important.
This disease is much more frequent in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
Currently, there are about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
Since this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has cure if it is discovered in time, it is possible to eradicate the virus from the body, so you can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
September 30th is the World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its objective is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less who they believe in God?
According to a recent research, religious faith had a calming effect that would also relieve the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
Within the framework of this unique experiment, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shock, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of research in which academics also participate, as well as scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University.
The analysis took place as follows; they set a sharp instrument at the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to set their eyes on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, work of 17th century Sassoferrato and the Lady of the armor of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts during viewing the religious painting or the other.
The Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "they calmed themselves and in their hearts peace reigned."
Observing the religious theme picture felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so striking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, like by a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality" - Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would the regulation of pain have on the faithful if the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of her size was shown?
Would the vision of a Virgin of high quality bring even better results?
You're what you say about yourself
In his tenth birthday Google can claim: you can find it in people's pocket, as well as in the sky above their head; you know where they spent their holidays, what doctors they visit and what they care about.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel to Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary in order to achieve the original goals of Google's founders: "We gather all the information in a system of the world!".
According to Google’s leader, the company even after ten years of work that returned to the world is still in the initial phase of the effort to handle all the information.
To the question what is going to happen in five years' time Schmidt replied this way: I want Google to be able to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best work I would like?" - However, the software will not be able to answer questions that seem so simple until there are enough information from users.
Not all netizens are aware that the search keywords, IP addresses and pages are accurately stored during their navigation on the Network.
Thanks, for example, to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can look back at what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if you take advantage of my data against myself, collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are worried about viewing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only retain, but in justified cases also give third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google handed over the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify the paedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who are concerned about people's rights, in May were relieved when the company, together with the EFF, an organization for the defence of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that they were right in their dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution to supply any information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to obtain its pretext to strengthen the child protection law passed years ago, about 50 thousand Web addresses and about a thousand wanted phrases, but without getting individual user search lists, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
So it is quite contradictory to think about Google: those who are afraid to supply their personal data because they think their privacy, their private lives are damaged when they start using Google’s services, and they rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "vant-garde incorporation", not so to its rival, the Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the World, however much they fight for the same objective.
This can happen because Google unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and looks more youthful, more collaborator than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because the geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that occurred precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional traces behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and as the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers list of their music customs, then they can be included in a tracking system like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, where the latest photo galleries are automatically featured in Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases of those who reveal that for example the bride, seeing the flow of photographs the next morning of the common friends, find out who spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because this writes her sincere opinion on the company's management blog: one thing is safe, the definition of private life was fully revalued.
A person's "on line" life is what she shows herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the behavior of the youth of our day.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least wants to do away with Google's monopoly, can do it (e.g. starting with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but does not leave any traces).
There are many people who don't want to register on collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but they can replace Google's "on line" applications, from text editing software to image and news-reading applications with alternative versions that don't connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day when Google shows its real face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while services that are increasingly introduced are causing serious headaches not only for Microsoft but also for numerous other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will also find the alarming contradictions: for example, the senior management strongly rejected the protests of employees after doubling the price of the company's childcare facility, considered too expensive the unlimited number of food of employees, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement filtered out any information that violated the good morale and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is already ready to work, what if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years can turn to the World: while some believe that Google's draft scanning and archiving of books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the Supreme Court of the United States, other fears of its Health system, because in it we can create our own comprehensive health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it can provide a good raw material for writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, novel of Cory Doctorow's popular, describes in that future orwelian form, in which a man only of Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the traces of the author of the double murder of the city of Ozd.
The police questioned two minors about Ozd's double murder who, according to reasoned suspicion, helped to erase the traces of the crime - said the spokesman of the General Public Order Commissioner of Borsod province on Tuesday.
Young people recognized the crime they were charged with, and are now accused of perpetrators of the crime.
The two minors - according to the information of the Hungarian News Agency - are two girls - can be defended in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The defendant of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pretrial detention since Sunday.
He was accused of killing several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigation it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he cited his creditor at the headquarters of a company in Ozd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim's nine-year-old daughter.
According to information from the ITT, the young man had prepared himself long before to commit the crime, for he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the crime scene.
The police analyze with an expert on the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the actions of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that within a few months they want to sell 60 percent of them.
The Czech Economic Journal E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange declared last week that among the stakeholders the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, about 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a participation of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the ever deeper international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the President of the United States - the Republic of Rome - the President has not even been able to obtain the support of his own party for the bill done hastily, whose aim is to give him a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", the multimillionaire investor Warren Buffett talked about, it's better to talk about a "second September 11th."
According to part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo's view the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that led to the world economy on the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is growing and this will affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the Congress's vote, the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is carried out.
You can't ignore this threat - points to the Geneva Tags-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw life belts on the stomping financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if as the dominoes get more banked, then they won't be enough either the new funds, nor the new improvisations.
It is necessary in the long term for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and to centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received only more than EUR 100 billion on Monday - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that there are more and more real concerns that, as the Americans have done, European taxpayers also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not been seriously concerned with the crisis that is going on as a token for the Old Continent .
The "saviators" will not have to present immediately hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid greater harm?
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the bee
What would be the best way to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of the obstacles sensors existing in nature?
For example, that of bees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the bees gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the system of robotic driving cars type BR23C imitating nature, to which the characteristics of the beejorros were given, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can do away with all collisions.
During the flight each beejorro creates its own ovaled private space that actually looks a lot like our safe capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the composite eyes of bees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eyes, engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
It identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that immediately turns into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the beehives, modifying the direction by turning to the necessary extent the wheels.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot of the vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to do away with other beeches.
This process must be done in an opening and closing the eyes.
However, unlike bees, the movement cannot turn upwards, downs or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the turn direction of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bees to dodge other bees, here they only used as a possibility for the car robot the rotation movement and acceleration as well the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is greater, which means that they have a longer life than that of lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is instinctive and intelligent reaction and not data processing capacity, much less storage capacity.
This device in each second should only process some input signals and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
You don't need gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step in developing technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into serial-made models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to his destination, avoiding the obstacles on his way.
You already have this dearest boy's name
The written version of the bill of the $700 billion financial ransom package has been prepared, which will be applied in various stages to purchase bad bank credits.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
Depending on the hours of the East Coast during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, the congress leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion financial rescue package, after several days of discussion, the Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, claiming that only formalization of the agreement is required in a document.
The commitment on the package was supported by both candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the result of the commitment stated: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about returning to the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 p.m., depending on Washington time (i.e. before 2 a.m. Monday morning, according to Central Europe time), without causing a spectacular leap in the bags.
On the Bill called the Emergency Act for Economic Stabilization of 2008, the first Monday will vote for the North American Congress and then for the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress achieved during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesman of the White House.
The programme is different from the original Bush administration proposal to spend all 700 billion dollars on the purchase of bad quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using 250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum, the Ministry of Finance will purchase securities of credit fund, poor rating and the destination of another $100 billion depends on the President's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion may be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: you can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and credit-backed securities, as well as other "veneous" type credits as well.
The purchase can be made either in auctions or directly - they informed competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in a insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated: The law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, deal with the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could result in the demolition of some major financial institutions.
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and are waiting for State aid may rely on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, in addition limitations depend on the form of assistance of the Ministry of Finance.
Limitation means that if the ministry buys under a auction, an extra tax will be imposed for gold parachute unless the failed chief of the bank retires.
By buying the bad credits directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the bosses' compensation is not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that will be in effect a legal limitation for the revenue of the directors-general - said the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress commission, responsible for the financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the programme, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they will eventually be able to obtain profits from the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and the bank.
According to the bill over the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return the losses of the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, on both sides, there were those who expressed their reservations about the project.
This is not what the American citizens gave us, that is to say, they are not protecting the taxpayers' dollars - declared the Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: the measures urged him to be the same as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

In the rest of the processing industry, there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent an important weight within the internal trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was recorded in August, primarily as a result of the increase in official prices from the first of July.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period - in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the highest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metal-making sector there was an increase of 13.2 per cent, while in the food, drink and tobacco industry, of determining weight, there was an increase of 11 per cent.

Will the next year no longer require visas to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian Agreement on Visa Exoneration to enter into force about 12 January - the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke of this in Chicago, before the Hungarian residents there.
In his opinion, "practically everything depends on the electronic access and control system being built on time across the Atlantic."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system, the admission premium will disappear, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin will have to register.
From now on, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed with the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing over the Median Cross to the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the candidates for the presidency, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, assured their support for the government's 700 million-dollar banking aid program on Sunday, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of Congress and the administration, following several-day marathon negotiations, announced in the morning of Sunday: a principle agreement was reached on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and defrosting the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, by putting economic issues in the foreground, Obama once again gained some advantage and disappeared McCain's advantage after the Republicans' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy to the vice president.
In a Detroit campaign rally, on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) the employment, the savings of you, besides whole industries and the stability of the whole economy" - he said to a multitude of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to describe McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview given to ABC McCain he explained that "we will all swallow this up hard (...) but not doing anything simply is not a viable way".
The Republican Senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control committee to the fines minister and the limitation of the compensation of the executives, he was the one who insisted on it.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, but he consulted with the minister on a daily basis.
The President of Congress Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the congressmen would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel on the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a rojinegro coalition.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo would have assumed its position.
The Christians for several decades were developing in Bavaria - and right now these modern citizens are the ones who give them back.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of the entire Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Sunday a process was completed that had been planned for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the aforementioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group became the most conscious, more critical and more stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones that have moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, the baccalaureate and the graduates.
Thus less than 40 percent of support for the CSU was refused.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
The Conservative newspaper of Vienna: "Who is it with? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved in coalition matters" - it deals with the confused situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ to interfere in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the greens however do not yet wish to consult the coalition.
Elections were already held, everything now revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely let any of their decks see.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question pending, which if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the position of Vice Chancellor.
He stated that in any event they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Multiterrestrial responded cautiously to red offerings.
He said that cooperation would probably not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
It is still open in the party if they will choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," said Haider.
Jéróka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, and its host is France, who is also President-in-Office of the European Union this year.
Lívia Járóka, a Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in his message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and is also the greatest obstacle to the existence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organisations attended the meeting.
Jéróka - according to the press bureau of the Fidesz group of Members in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are primarily out of the labour market because of their low level of education.
"Most Gypsies have not finished middle school and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small part can obtain university diplomas."
Jároka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member of the European Parliament, these issues need to be made widely aware of both Roma and non-Gypsy issues.
As soon as the school begins, a Gypsy student will have more opportunities to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumer taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"As citizens of the European Union, Gypsies must ensure their right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the European Parliament, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of school segregation immediately, so it is of fundamental importance that the correct implementation of the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives should be carried out.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunity to guarantee democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Jóróka said.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting, held in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level of the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be taken at the end of October on the fate of the failure of Mr Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, for the time being the debate on personal matters has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their positions, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the special congress of the party that will be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so-critical two gave an interview: they do not cling so much to their positions.
They wanted to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who, one day after the "tsunami bávaro" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under Edmund Stoiber's leadership that was at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the blow attested against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria, which gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the South province, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to prevail, in the future they will no doubt have to make a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the Party's restructuring, vice-president Horst Seehofer, federal minister of agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that starts negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Free Right on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that in the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was taken for the blow of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly removed from the scene to the ambitious local politics.
The CSU's top leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition it will also be given an active role Stoiber who has been moving the strings in the background so far, the former provincial chief of government and former president of the CSU qualified on 28 September as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the Bundestag's September 2009 elections, Merkel will not be able to be a Chancellor unless they are able to enhance the CSU together that played a key role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel that he could severely conceal his disappointment over failure, the losses of the CSU will not adversely affect the great Berlin coalition.
What is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After the elections on Sunday, there will be no opposition Member in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that it guarantees in the country Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral result.
Although the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, made up of a hundred and ten Members, more than a decade ago it had no opposition, before yesterday's elections to the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), it hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, would "allow" the entry of some of the opposition's Members into parliament.
Thus ODSZ suppressed the boycott that originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which increasingly depends on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the ever more expensive imports of natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give permission to enter Lukashenko and other high-level politicians for having a political regime considered antidemocratic.
It was a sign of distancing when the OSCE, in assessing the electoral campaign, placed more emphasis on positive phenomena than on errors - such as the prohibition of participating in a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary Monday report criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With this in the view of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk was prepared for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - a month ago that considers the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - the Alexandr Milinkevich newspaper has been told.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime is afraid to allow even one opponent to enter that weightless parliament."
The opposition does not plan to organize protests by seeing the results, but rather tries to get voters to their message about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes a lot of problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities are making it difficult for their distribution, but even so I see that it is more and more those who support the change among older people, too - said Milinkevich, alluding that the Lukashenko regime, which believes its main result is the creation of social security, do not consider it appropriate even for retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time that the breakdown of social security that "seems to be similar to the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers opposed the opposition politician described the elections as democratic.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts", so that the lack of opposition is nothing other than testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before starting work"
It has never happened in the History of Chigi Palace that put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but since today it starts with this measure against the one who does and then goes to the bar to have a coffee on working hours.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors," says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" the minister needs.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is Reformism," Brunetta stresses again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There has been no resistance on the part of the employees, the secretary general says: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration on the part of them."
In short, no more breakfast on working hours; no more coffee and medium moons.
Brunetta's Word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchin at 7 am is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Superior School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences for public employees' diseases have been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people at work in one year".
And he adds that there is a need for more effective public administration
Italian, "which wage dynamics – the minister explains – in the last 8-10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
For now, millions of public employees have joined in opposition to the rules of the Brunetta decree by acceding to the Codacons-supported request.
"While the Minister of the Public Service shows numbers, the least absenteeism of work due to causes of illness – writes the consumer association – the people of the 'crazy workers' is constantly increasing.
It is millions in Italy that employees of the correct and productive public administration who have joined together to declare war to the illegitimate norms of the decree."
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of economic treatments aggregated by disease due to service; the extension of the time-beams in which the medical check-up visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Working accidents, Napolitano: "Crime prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
By 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that the white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths from homicides.
In order to draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention at work is," says President Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association Mutilated and Disabled by Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative effort for the prevention of the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness of public opinion".
"It has manifested itself, a 'basta', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of its dimensions, provoke the cries of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is the many initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For its part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini House has emphasized "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes a determined effort on all institutions to put an end to it urgently."
"Data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from equally impressive," noted the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "tension to decline" to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy exploits.
"We believe that there is still too little going on at the general level to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our view - it has highlighted Mercandelli – greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school ".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as it concerns communication and awareness of public opinion.
But, above all, there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers regarding a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary care provided for the victims of work" and the "assistance bias towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The aim is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he has added - because the fate of the person who is injured does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator every time."
Mp3 low readers accuse, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for a long time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
It refers to the European Commission, which, in a statement published in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Cssseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the high-volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable musical devices and high-level mobile phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an unremediable manner," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific evidence – following EU responsibility – a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and deliver this public domain information.
We must also review existing systems of control in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have a step forward with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that it causes.
"Scientists - the EU executive concludes - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and stakeholders what possible measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical devices and related devices."
At present, there is already a European security standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the auditory damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by resorting to solutions such as reduction of levels and time of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that the users of portable musical devices listen to music at a high volume (but of 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit on maximum noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be held.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Fuck of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning at its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission discussed the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the board and the council evaluated analyses and projects, in order to present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official bull" of the Municipality and its neighbour Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all the political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to emphasize German – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the council and the municipal council will then be able to swallow.
There is no remaining role position, only the desire to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – announces the nominee – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
To whom the Commission is accused of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, German replied: "Everything depends on the work that will be able to carry out the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
Policy is almost always crushed in ordinary management and in back-to-back emergencies.
On the contrary, we want to look beyond and into the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
The headmaster of Rome would also like to point out that "this Commission is neither useless nor trivial: it is absolutely free, it will not cost Roman citizens a euro and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital expresses".
For German, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking with a united spirit to its future."
A future that, needs the consignor of Rome" would not be limited only to the present municipal borders but would look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but also "also considering the role that Rome can and should develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
He wrote an American political note that he was interested in going independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and pipe relations (as he does today also gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the date of the elections approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great face of stone: he thinks he has won the highest position of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!".
They're actually attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And they're also polls; they all say Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there is one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the depths of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the cabin to vote, we will know who will vote for the American patriot.
It goes one side of the American mentality covered up to the last.
"Say whatever you want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether about Obama or about McCain."
There are people who swear: if you get to win Obama, we'll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
Despite all these reasonings, however, the winning weapon for democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were Bush's errors during his term of office? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Likewise, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak spot.
Whoever assumes George W's position will have an enormous duty to develop.
U.S., the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "murder" for the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists have been interviewed by POW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared themselves less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition to the cuts made in the hall where the editors work to do the newspaper, it is a great problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the majority of the public understands is not expected to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism predominates today about the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following the wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views such as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in hope "to do something good" by journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers – i.e. the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of the national executives are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage is lower than 23 per cent.
For some this has to do with "working security."
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe work" on the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "get it or leave it."
Directors receive almost always good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, are "sick" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILLO COPULA IF BEING GROOTTAFERATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppolo is investigated by bankruptcy in the area of investigation into the contra-agreement agreement relating to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the process of arresting him, last week, he obtained house release, turning him into mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate be able to travel the route of the city of the province to a room of the capital.
According to the court, these trips (by which the pm voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that he is being accused.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago by the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this one, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
It gives us a confirmation of yesterday's New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican Party, ever more divided between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "the ones of Washington" and to the world of finance, especially strong in the states of Central and South.
The soul, in fact, who has become preponderant with the vow of the one speaking at the beginning.
This is just quoted is just one example of the mutations, the major mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Whether in the United States or in Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to function as a accelerator for incubation phenomena that with the new climate are solidified and come out.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual status-sovereignity category in relation to a type of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance, if, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all, the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more committed.
He who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or has not much to say: the crucial test is the European Union which, as always, divides between different interests and the different state strategies, does not succeed in deciding any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, of new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the moment they arrive at the court, it is only the state that owns the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
They also possess the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values under certain circumstances in which no market will likely be available and no organization will ever have to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance as the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a very related factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the ever more sophisticated network of technology, of immaterial technology, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future would instead have to do more and more with the immaterial things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, look, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as a sovereign, certainly has many more letters about who he is not, and who has the misfortune to live in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second novelty, but it's premeditating a fracture.
It is said that the Territory, the State, the Government, inevitably speaks politics and leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective consciousness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, of inadequately identified economic species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inappropriate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in a growing number.
It seems to progress ever more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far on the rise, the same way to feel and be, their culture in the inclusive exception of the term, to have made their own time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "revolution" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American congress against Bush (and also layers with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to see).
The impression is that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say no, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent, what it is taking shape today are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and stirs potentially in dismeasures.
In the face of all this talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Winning the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walking on walls like the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has approached a lot.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to paste a body of 100 kilograms onto a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The beginning of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a spaguetis pile" explains Zhong Lin Wang at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the paws of the gecko, covered by microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect adherence.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "is easily taken off the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the engineering faculty of the University of Dayton.
HOW TO WALK BY PAREDS? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Capables to walk through walls exactly like the spider man? Capables yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronics, because carbon nanotubes are heat drivers and electric current.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superheroes.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - Berkeley University, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers as hair that self-cleans themselves from dust during the movement on a surface to maintain always a perfect adherence.
Phharmacs: never with fruit juice
Attention to apple juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, mostly consumed in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken simultaneously with some drugs alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packed that fresh associated with the assumption of some medicines David Bailey, professor at Western Ontario University in London, who since the 236th National Meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a cup of apple, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Apple juice was already low because it was held responsible for increasing at toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal products.
FARMACOS A RISGES – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mixture and to pay attention to what is drinking in the case of a drug being taken, such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan:"This findings are generally pointed out to the various agencies of international and national drug that eventually provide to change the information notes of the State University.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicinal products that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, let us not be impressed, ask the doctor clearly or the pharmacist," said the expert of the Ansa agency.
The Novel of Economy to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of trade and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush's management decisions on economics and foreign policy.
A few months after the attack on 11 September 2001, on those days that Enron was breaking, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in consequence terms for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years has been blamed on the economy, but has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and a little upset that the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom quickly disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive divulner, particularly critical against the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism".
Open Office, echo the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open-source personal productivity suite that aims to attract ever more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work from voluntary developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the less coarse magazine interface, other more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format(Open Document Format) 1.2,the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also put to multi-function with Office 2007 suite Open Office is able to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, useful, for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility to import the PDF file into the graphic development module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents that accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of modifications, in the drafting of texts, each contributor is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to carry some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the next few weeks should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English mirror since Friday.
Besides, for Windows and Mac OS, as the suite is normally also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can also send the installation cd to home or to work.
And if the free theme can be a hook for the dissemination in houses, it is in business that Open Office the test suite, tries the big bet, already able to have several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is not even the realities that provide an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the known Access is the program that allows you to work on the base date; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached nearly 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the tour of France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third-class and winner of the best climber.
To give the news is the website of the L'Equipe newspaper.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl's blood samples is among those performed in the last few weeks at the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratory.
If the counter evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and will be angry against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive doping at the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the Spanish-speaking Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, awarding the bet of the best climber.
INVENTS:NEW YORK TIMES ASKED, IS ITALY A RACIST?
Italy of emigrant country has recently become only a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted itself to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy based on the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where they are recorded "more integration and more work" but also the country's highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest support of the Northern League."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation loved by the League also tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Trend marked by the Pope that by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the State and the church to work together to combat racism".
Students of the car rental, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the last Sunia survey, the tenant union, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious features to the point of excluding the right to study a large number of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to sustain – explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities strong demand has completely distorted the market so as to trigger a process of widespread increase even for residents."
Apart from that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, without the limit of canon, linked sub-rents.
For Sunia, there is a need for extraordinary interventions that, through the review of tax taxation, prices can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, there are approximately 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) at an average value of 800 (Lambate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the University, they serve EUR 250/280 for one bed in a double room and between 370 and 500 for one individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for an individual room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas near other universities (Ostien and Cinecità).
You save only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros per one bed and 450 per one single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and around.
In Naples for one bed you are served 300/450 euros, for one room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed you are served 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one person.
in the most girl cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities as well as in Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and extra-Communitys is more frequent, there is a subsequent anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradise, the city cancels the historic rooms
Historical cinemas close by favoring multiplexes.
"A city without cinematographic halls in a blind city, is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photographs effectively what is happening in the great Italian urban centers as well as in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great methics on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historic places, full of memory," it's like a friend died, a known one with which a piece of place and so much emotion was shared," says the director of the new cinema Paradise, the film that 20 years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury to Cannes, which counted the poetry of a provincial cinema hall and nostalgia for the way of living the movie that was lost perhaps forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the leading association of traders, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and the majority of the rooms in the main cities are above all the rooms in Florence: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most suffering from closures are as first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 lesser cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for his disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, it is the same three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new methic cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romaña.
"The Italian exercise has been developed irrationally" notes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec," it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the mechanics.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the previous state debt is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year".
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned by the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono room is in the historical center that on the outskirts.
Among the proposed rules are tax facilitation measures for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators may enter the restricted traffic area and will have special parking rates.
"It's an initiative I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true, that in contrast to the extra power of the methics, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is an issue that was always important to me: the closing of the cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to realize the "New Cinema Paradise", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Chirinale of the already closed National Way, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, not to see the posters that are uningredged by the dust, I turn to the other side”.
Link between politics and 'drangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the municipal elections for the interested in the Piromalli cosca."
The charges are heavy that the magistrates of the Calabria Antimafia Directorate give to the headmaster and vice-consignor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by Mafia association.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted by mob criminal association and compensation for 10 million euros.
"Depreciating any legal and moral norm, and in good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to counsel Piromalli.
"The Mafia family - the judges write - would have been allowed to enter the municipality officially by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between bad organized life" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'dragheta, heroes that remain clean."
The arrests this morning are added to those of the past July after the police had announced the cutting of heads of the Mafia family Piromalli.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, head of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the ballotage in May 2006, had been elected as head of a right centre coalition.
I'm going through a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call into question the vice minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of organizing everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to request the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental intercepts made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the public administration's elections on the interests of Mafia families."
When energy comes from waves, big ones go down to stage
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and are now discovering it, the major global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the great ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of raising energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s along with the first oil crisis, the investigations have intensified.
When the price of low oil in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was set aside, but now environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) has estimated that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the wave movement of the sea.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants at the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enerssis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are always more and among these companies who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – the spokesperson of a company associated with the ha to the US oil colossus at the Wall Street Journal – and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is on obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is quite an important signal, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to make new drillings.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to follow the path of the energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about technology still at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts like those Portuguese or Scottish are small in size and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce long-scale energy, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a good bond system between them.
The force of the waves, which makes the good ones move up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure rotates a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through underwater cables.
For now there are four such developing implants, pending only federal approval, apart from energy, could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping center and parking, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there is tides, causes the turbines' pallets to rotate, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electrical Energy, is now worth the potential of tides.
While it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the energy of tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others near the coast, have invested $7 million and a half dollars in 2008 and an investment of 35 million is planned for 2009.
