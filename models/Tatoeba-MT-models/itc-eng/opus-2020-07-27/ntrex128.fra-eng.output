Members of the Assembly of the Wales concerned about "passing for puppets"
Gallois are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment to the name of the House, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of rallies.
One elected worker said that his group was concerned about the fact that the acronym “rime with Twp and Pwp”.
For non-originating readers of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotte.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (Parti of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other forms.
The conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionet), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English in the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation introducing a change of name, stated that “the final decision concerning the designation of members of the Assembly is to be made by the latter”.
The Government of Wales (Government of Wales Act, 2017) Act 2007 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Welsh Parliament, which has been widely supported.
On the question of the title of members, the Commission is in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Welsh prefers MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could be a real head for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a draft name change law in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the question of name in the discussion of the draft law.
Macedonia: referendum on change of country name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be named the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a dispute between the country and its Greek neighbour for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
Athens has long stressed that Macedonia's name constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its neighbouring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, indicated that he would not take into account the results.
However, partisans such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that changing names is only a small price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of Saint Martin reduced to silence
"The old people I discussed with say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street," says Adams.
"There is no more of it today."
According to him, it's normal that the bars have been razed.
Today, "we don't have a date anymore," he explains.
"Before, we went to the bar like we were at his neighbor's house, but that's not the case."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted well before what the leaders imagine, and this concerns him: " Sooner or later, they will return to the starting box."
He added that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who would not help to maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
"The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely of the Whites who will hasten the closure of all churches, because it is unlikely that they will become members," he expressed concern.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The early white Methodist Congregation abandoned places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was taken over by a black community under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops of 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which Blacks were painting themselves to be employed or to obtain a promotion.
In 1939, a fire devastated the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and command a new carillon,
that Father Johnson's son and successor to the church of Saint Martin, Rev. David Johnson, proudly called "the bells of the poor people."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave him a different name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon in Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather states that Saint Martin has not replaced him.
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of questions about the relocation of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the lay elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the parish council wished to impose the costs incurred, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: a 13-year-old teenager injured by a shark during a lobster fishing party
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old man last Saturday while practicing lobster fishing in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's television channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming with help and paid up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought the young boy was crying out of joy about having had a catch, and then he realized that in reality he
It was bitten.
Upon arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I cried for everyone to come out of the water: There's a shark!" Chad says.
The boy was evacuated to hospital Rady Children in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The shark species at the origin of the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, the rescue leader Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered trauma from the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the UK aesthetics market
Sainsbury's hands are low on Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and the garnit of rays similar to those of supermarkets, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetics market of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home goods are falling, more extensive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience turns out conclusive.
Supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offers to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in areas similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also boosts its makeup line Boutique to offer a majority of non-tested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the fragrance seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops in Sainsbury's, the first open last week in Croydon, south of London, and a second opening of which is scheduled in the course of the year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders must get their heads up to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to make their online purchases and move to nearby shops for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, director general of Sainsbury's, said that the sales points will increasingly look like large areas, as the supermarket chain tries to counter shops discount Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two channels 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to propel the sales of common consumer goods and to profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempts to restructure the rays of pharmaceutical and cosmetics in the British chain had been overcome by a failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's partnership with Boots was attempted, but it ended up following a controversy about the distribution of benefits from pharmaceuticals implanted in supermarkets.
It was after 3 years ago that he sold his 281 pharmacies for an amount of £125 million in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical Chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role there that was to introduce in 4 stores a wide range of high-quality skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been changed to improve the customer environment.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the beauty of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now indisputable and changes the buying habits," added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal of an agreement of £11 million
Star star star of Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of host Holly Willoughby from a contract up to £11 million linked to his home decoration brand, to devote itself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the interior decoration brand and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptrew.
At the age of 37, this Morning's cheerleader announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby went furious Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration at the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was furious when the child dear to TV revealed, at a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den Star Trade Empire in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, up to £1.5 million, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their brand of interior decoration and accessories.
The Truly brand was likened to that of the actress Gwyneth Ptrew, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the host's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, age 37, announced on Instagram that she left Truly, Jones jumped into his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities
and it is beginning to ensure its future for the next 2 decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's seat is filled with products ready to sell."
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, which is one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause millions to be lost to society, due to significant investments in goods ranging from cushions or candles, clothing or indoor items, and the risk of delayed launch.
Moreover, this could put an end to a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went together on vacation and Peter Jones holds 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the brand-name ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as an entertainer of the I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was horrifying, but we finally loved it.
Trump made fun of the media that criticized him because of his comment that some people judge "indignified by a president", and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
He's talking about a voice from a TV reporter.
"I have not given up at all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-un had supported the holding of a second meeting, after Trump had qualified the first meeting, which took place in Singapore in June, in a significant way towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization are at a standstill.
More than 3 months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy leader Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that there was no "response" response to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his Trump assembly speech he offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," says North American President.
We have engaged in armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim resulted in positive results: the end of missile shooting tests, the release of hostages and the remnants of North American military personnel returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this arena full to crack, there's barely more than 200 standing in front of me," he criticized by pointing finger to the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGO assistance was not supposed to be necessary.
More than 10% of the Lombok population had been scattered, but no state of national disaster had been decreed, a condition required for the launch of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it clear that they did not want international assistance, which complicates things a little," she regretted.
While the Save the Children organization sets up a team to go to Palu, she still does not know if the field work will be allowed.
The spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian assistance.
Despite the shocks it has constantly suffered, the country is in a cruel lack of means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Refugees have been moved to Aceh, but they are rarely found in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been communicated, no alarm siren has failed to report to Palu, which has probably contributed to human losses.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to the other is not simple.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been deployed to Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the new disaster site.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has placed the reform of the infrastructure at the centre of his electoral campaign and has spent considerable amounts on restoring roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, threatened Mr. Joko's government, which was called to represent itself in front of the electors next year.
The Indonesian head of state also suffered pressures from the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practiced their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven out of their homes, deep into the streets of Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: The attacker at the Liverpool Daniel Sturridge manages to equalize against Chelsea

The balloon flew over the repair surface before moving to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ends up reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its way to the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to place myself, to grab the ball, but players like Shaq always pull as far as possible, so I tried to make the most of the time," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really much thinking I decided to shoot."
Chelsea took 1 to 0 in half-time after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker struck a pass in the direction of Mateo Kovacic, before heading towards the middle of the terrain and sprinter side Liverpool.
Kovacic realized a quick and come in the middle of the field,
Then he made a magnificent deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard goes past the defense and ends his race in the net of the second pole, with a shot from the left foot behind the doorman of Liverpool, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitains in the group phase of the League of Champions on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo de Naples Stadium, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in Europe League of UEFA, at 3 p.m. this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: The number of tsunami victims is 832
The disaster management agency reported on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami balance sheet reported 832 deaths.
Many inhabitants are trapped under the debris of the buildings destroyed by the earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 that shook the country Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, informed the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was surrounded by debris from collapsed buildings.

Parliament: Cromwell's statue, last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the fair return of things, in the light of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural property of England, committed by its Puritian supporters, such as the fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and has called it "reviewary attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, says that "in view of the current debate about the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's one erected in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor led iconoclasm during the British civil wars.
It is likely that the person was sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, carved by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith stated the following on Sunday Telegraph: " Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean of the monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracture.
Its achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated."
China: a pig kills a breeder
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a South-East China market.
Identifyed as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery slashed and covered with blood near a porcelain on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, said on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a pig shop on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the Province of Qinghai, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday, in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door in the neighboring china was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A medical legal report confirms that the animal weighs 250 kg has mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the cousin of the breeder, said "his legs were rubbed and covered with blood."
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death was not a member of either the breeder or his cousin.
One market manager told Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any other incident and to allow the police to collect evidence.
Elector Yuan's family and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, attacks on pigs have already been reported.
In 2016 on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously hurting the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig placed a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get away from him.
In 2012, while a Oregon breeder had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behaviour.
"They are rather game animals,
very curious kids... they have no intention of harming.
It is enough to show them due respect," he assures them.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa should cause heavy precipitation in the south-east of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the coldest waters on the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will lead to adverse events in north-eastern Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
The winds were at 135 km/h (oragan of category 1) from 5 a.m. to 5 a.m. on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is supposed to move north on Sunday.
During this period, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows east to the west coast of the United States. As it draws closer to the low-California peninsula on Monday in the form of a storm, hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the north, in the south-west of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in parts of Mexico this Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the south-west in the coming days.
At the local level, rainfalls reaching between 2.5 cm and 10 cm will cause dangerous sudden crusts, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
The aversions will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, particularly in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in areas in the south-west, especially a large part of Arizona.
Dissipated tropical rains are likely to cause high floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Intense rains could convert canyons into torn rivers and thunderstorms will produce winds and dust pellets by places.
The approaching depression will give rise to abundant local rains in some southern regions of the country, on the California coast.
The rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could lead to low debris flows and make the sliding chaussis.
It could be the first rains of the region's dry season.
Dispersed tropical aversions will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rainfall will fall across the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Important temperature variations are expected for the month of October through the United States due to the refreshing of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will be subject to considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat forces to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the center and east of the United States are expected to experience a hot October start, with temperatures of around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other regions of the north-east.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
The multi-day forecast indicates that temperatures should be higher than the average in the east of the United States during the first fortnight of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
On 6 television stations on Thursday, the seizures of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse continues, the broadcasters have interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a theatrical strike: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, the Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct a one-week indictment investigation.
In front of the Senate's Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured 100% that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had committed to hitting his person and had tried to take off his clothes during a school night.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, also claimed to be 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial has probably reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Moreover, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts widely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most watched channel during the day of the hearings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with a hearing reaching 3.26 million.
They followed CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
Interest did not weaken once the hearing was over.
Flake was in the middle of the drama playing Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a communiqué that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was taken part by demonstrators as he attempted to take the elevator to the hearing of the judicial commission.
Flake lowered her eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of the live interpellation.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," launches one of the women.
"Do you really believe he's telling the truth?
You hold power when so many women are poor."
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake indicated that her office had issued a statement and would say more during the Committee's meeting.
All the cable and broadcast network channels covered the meeting live a few hours later, while the judicial commission was preparing to vote on the procedure for advancing the appointment of Kavanaugh by the entire Senate.
Flake indicated, however, that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on the charges against the candidate, which the minority democrats claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by discussing with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He took his decision after having met with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance sheet, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault charges.
Great Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making "small politics"
In an interview given to the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project of leaving the European Union, of making "small politics" to the detriment of Britain's future and of national interest.
May arrived at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in cover, his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks against his Czech plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "clearly ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being the cause of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect from the fatal shooting that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was beaten and charged with murder at the second level, said Baton Rouge police service.
The authorities posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Founded at the crime scene, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, the subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police being responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the lawyer of the parish of Baton-Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by a bullet wound that crossed the head and stayed in the neck.
The police department recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the medical-legal laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the law enforcement for their "commitment and quest for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Redge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and performed 2.6 bounces per match during the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach said the team was "damaged and under shock" after the news of Wayde's death.
"We're reviewing this kind of event all the time," says Wade.
Mexico: An Ashtray Rock Volcano · Global Voices
From ash from the Popocatepetl volcano, it reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Reduction Centre recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after having recorded a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The centre monitored several earthquakes and cracks from Popocatepetl.
On social media, images showed fine layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano level 72 km from the capital, since a magnitude earthquake of 7.1 struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between the police and the separatists approaching the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and the riot police, while thousands of opponents joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being refouled by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and coloured powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not decompose tourists.
Heats also exploded later in the day, while the police used matraquerades to contain the clashes.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence that were scanning "neither forgotten nor forgiven", faced unionist supporters shouting "long life in Spain".
14 protesters with mild injuries were treated according to the local press.
One year after the referendum on 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain alive in the independence region.
A overwhelming majority of voters have chosen independence, despite a low rate of participation, who have largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing the polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
It was all the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said that he no longer had any hope as to the independence of Catalonia.
"We were witnesses last year of a great time.
My parents would cry for joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in an impasse," he regrets.
Despite their capital victory, though minor, in the regional elections last December, independent Catalan parties had difficulty maintaining momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for holding the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who filmed the police support demonstration on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on the one hand and on the other.
"Treatment only rises," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison awaiting a trial since last year, announced his intention to apply for election to the European Parliament next year.
"It is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government," he added.
Arrest in Londonderry : Men beat a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being buried several times on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynegard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would have also received arrow shots.
Livingston wins the 1 to 0 game against Rangers thanks to Menga
The first goal of Dolly Menga is to win Livingston
Recently mounted in the ranks, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games in Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place themselves in the second position of the ranking, on an equal footing with Hibernian.
Gerard's men are deprived of victory outside the Premiership league this season, and have to face the Hearts team on Sunday, which leads 8 points.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League this Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she's been pursuing 6 games in the division, and her main coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, can be sure that she hasn't lost the least.
Livingston missed an opportunity to face angry opponents
Holt's team could have made a move long before it started, as their direct approach put the Rangers in difficulty.
Scott Robinson tried to perch but remained embossed in front of the opposing goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
Livingston's team left the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that it could upset them by working tactics.
That's where the decisive goal is.
The Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston tried to open up; Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to catch Menga, who took a touch and scored a goal of the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but were faced with an impenetrable defense and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was only rarely worried.
The second half-time was the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos had to stop Kelly.
Allan McGregor's guardian stopped a hit by Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to play one of the Livingston's plans.
The Keeper of Livingston rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the arbitrator, one for the rebellion of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a fault.
Livingston’s “event” - Analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and stunning results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and team composition have not changed practically since their return to the top, but the merit is largely to Holt for having since his motivated arrival a team
which has many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in haleine throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed one last chance and only once succeeded in perching the opposing side; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the picture.
Home mixed by President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Several issues, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU, have been addressed.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into his country.
The cleavage that emerges from protests reflects Erdogan's double vision: a visitor welcomed by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at around 1015 local hours, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent trip from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The vehicle driver stopped, the rescue arrived on site, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday. The driver had fled.
The London police reported that the officers were working hard to identify the individual and to prevent his or her relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been set up. It is recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 agents injured in a riot
The senior security officer of the prison reported that six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot started in the HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, around 0930 hours this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Anti-Smoking specialists were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On site, the agents were treated for mild facial injuries.
A spokesperson from the prison management said: "From trained personnel has been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will have to answer the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended."
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals who are considered the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the director of the prison was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot agents were sent to prison to suppress a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by high creeks (which could be beneficial to drought-affected areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression hits Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. The hurricane Rosa is heading south-west with what remains of its energy. This region could be hit by raw ups.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with announcing rains from Monday night.
The national weather service based in Phoenix stated in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center provide 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Grand Basin should record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures up to 10 cm.
The rains of Rosa could be life-saving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of sudden crudeness.
Although the flood risk should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial to the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the United States drought monitoring system, slightly more than 40% of Arizona had at least one extreme-grade drought, the second most serious category," said weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins his journey on the coast, on the peninsula of Basse-Californie.
Always with great power on Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at 20 km/h speed.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the strength of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and lead to flood risk.
"In total, between 7.5 cm and 15 cm of precipitation are expected from Lower California to the north-west of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the border of the Arizona Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross the Arizona and the south of Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
" Torrent rains are expected in Basse-Californie, north-west of Sonora and in the south-west desert and are the main danger," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these rainfalls will result in potentially fatal peaks and debris flows in the arid areas, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted homicide, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday about 4am in the morning at local time.
He's been sent to the hospital, his condition is currently stable.
The police of Avon and Sommerset reported arresting the four young people (age 17, 18 and 20) on the night of the Radstock side.
Officers have called on people who might have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has been a victim of the wickedness and anger of Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the wickedness and anger of democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of the Congress on Thursday, rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault several decades ago with energy and emotion when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" today.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of the Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first decisive procedural vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, according to a statement by a member of the Republican Party at CNN.
Indonesia: A earthquake and tsunami are hundreds of victims, and the balance sheet is rising.
On Saturday, the authorities said that at least 384 people had been killed, most of them being carried away by huge waves that fell on the beaches while a earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hit the Indonesian island of Célébes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when six-metre high waves submerged the beach at the fall of the night. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People didn't run away immediately, it cost them their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone. He drove cars, pieces of wood, dwellings, he took everything with him," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing to the trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Palu.
Air images published by the Disaster Management Agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as a water mosque.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquakes have been felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (PPPT) stated that the energy released by the earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Corps were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that human and material losses could be more important on 300 km of coast north of Palu, a region called Donggana, the closest to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications were "completely paralyzed" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," said La Croix Rouge in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not having disseminated the information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived as long as the alert was published.
A shared amateur video on social media shows a man on the floor of a building that screams freneticly at the street passersby that a tsunami is approaching.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate images immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a general power failure that cut all communications to Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to transport aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened as part of the relief operations, but it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centres of Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: There are more than 800 deaths on the tsunami record.
It's a tragedy.
The staff of the World Vision of Dongala arrived healthy and safe in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters established in the yard of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not yet the case.
"This disaster is still considered regional," says Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that it is a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the disappeared people still hoped for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman seveled under the debris for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Gendon Subandano, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, said Mandagei.
"As an elder in the discipline of the paragliding, I have experienced my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon reported that he had desperately sent messages WhatsApp to the athletes in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
His messages remained unanswered.
"I think they never received my messages."
In Newport on the Levee, thieves underestimate $26,750 when charging an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves ripped out $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police service.
The vehicle driver used to kill a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepare to feed it, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a money bag for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leave the area, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Everyone with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Anciently known as Kanye West."
41 years old, West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to the program Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his arrival for "emotional reasons", explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being the abbreviation of its current pseudo professional, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you," explained West earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
"Then I am you, I am us.
I moved from Kanye, which means “the only one, ” to Ye - reflects good, evil, confusion, and everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the tie of union and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO states that it will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians, almost 50 years after bloody reprisals of law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that Tlatelolco would "never use military force to punish the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened the fire during a pacifist event, killing 300 people at the time the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed himself to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly student allowances and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities cause young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several actors in the US government made IA announcements, while an official AI strategy is missing in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the leader of AI innovation by 2030.
"Dubling funds for research in IA would be a good start, as all other countries have a long lead on the United States, and we are looking for the next major discovery in IA," says Lee.
Double the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the IA comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most important IM companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that beat the best-class American Othello player. He then integrated Microsoft Research's management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to obtain funding from the government.
"It's not China that owns academic leaders, it's companies," says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large academic names to work on IA.
Lee added that the changes in immigration policies could also support U.S. I. efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically awarded to AI researchers," he says.
The Council of State Affairs of China unveiled its new generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academic partners. The White House has announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in IA research.
At the same time, US legislation to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard at a referendum on the change of their country's name for the Republic of Macedonia of the North. This change would resolve an old dispute of several decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces known as Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a right on its territory and has opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the slave population of Macedonia, a majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote at the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum participation of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for membership of NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to partisans of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which has escaped the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the aegis of the European Union, which means a safer life for each one of us," said Olivera Georgijska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the vote was not legally binding, sufficient members of the parliament affirmed that they would follow the result of the vote and make it decisive.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority of the parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 13 h.
But the participation was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that had mobilized 66% of the voters registered after the vote.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the name change, in order to open the voice for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumi, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to go through the big door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from necessary investments, with the unemployment rate in the country above 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr. Zaev after he filed his newsletter.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian Telma channel, estimated participation at 57 per cent.
70 per cent of the participants who intended to vote said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50 per cent of the votes plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to pro-West government policy since it took power in May last year.
Decision-making: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, leads a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 match on Saturday, at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
The goal of Aguero, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine butter received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before diving in the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed a defender before evincing the others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to return the balloon to Aguero, who used his right foot to mislead Brighton's guardian, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, team coach, to journalists.
"We said he'd play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the chance to see him at the time."
But it was Sterling who had given the initial advantage to Skyblues during the First League game,
29th minute.
Aguero received the balloon directly on Brighton's field.
He sent him to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few hits before taking Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the balloon into the nets just before sliding out of the field.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play holiday riots against Rockies
As the Nationals team got rid of the play-off race, there was no reason to run into a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in case of an elimination match for the Rockies, true legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies took him to the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to secure their title as first division.
"Even if this game doesn't have any issues, we want to climb the ground to Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level that I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate? »
The Nationals still have to announce a launcher starting on Sunday, but would be inclined to leave the place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be in training on Thursday and will launch during his usual day of rest, on Sunday.
The right-winger of Washington is at 18-7 with an average worth of 2,53 and 300 withdrawals on 220 steps and two-thirds of this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation that had generated his support for the Supreme Court in Brett Kavanaugh by talking about the importance of the Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is a major issue. I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever. That is why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates," he said.
Trump continued "You see this terrible radical group, really horrible, democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They care about whom they hurt, about whom they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it over the last four days," he added, before calling the democrats of people "angry, mean and lying."
He referred to the judicial committee of the U.S. Senate and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led him to be hated by the public.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Have you disclosed the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community he was.
It is not tolerant of those who express their ideas
When activists from the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour Party parliamentarians who are considered not to be welcome.
My Parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she rose up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the gathering of the Nottingham East Labour Friday said: "We want the gathering to be inclusive and productive."
That is exactly what the Friday evening general assemblies were for my eight years as a Labour Party parliamentarian.
Unfortunately, this is not the case today for many gatherings and the promise of more mild and more respectful policies has been forgotten for a long time if it has never been taken into account.
It became clear that the opposing opinions were no longer tolerated in the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy's power was taken. The colleagues I was thinking of sharing the same political vision began to wait for me to return my jacket and to take a stand against my convictions, whether it's about national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, it was an abusive act on social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I received were of a political nature.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a shift in sexist or racist speech every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in the current policy is the standardization of the various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn declared that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is confined to the motions of defiance and changes to the rules of selection.
I've been given a lot of advice over the past two years: to lower my eyes, not to express my ideas so loud, and everything would be all right.
But it is not to act and I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, because the neglect of the Thatcher government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it the most, whether as a local advisor or as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and disputes with current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion Friday is that the country goes to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my electors, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunity will prevent me from acting for the causes that I am defending, which are your interests to all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr remains invincu
Two late trials may have failed the final result, but no doubt about it: Today deserved this triumph after the intense game day of the Scottish Rugby Championship at XV.
The team is now at the top of the ranking and becomes the only team defeated by the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can be pleased with this match.
"So far, we have been tested. But we remain invaincus, so I must regard myself as happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose congratulated Ayr: "Good to them, they were more effective than us and they were able to seize the opportunities."
The trial of Grant Anderson, at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, has put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for the Scottish Wing Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the figures speak. Jason Baggot took a non-transformed test.
Climamo worsened the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of the day. It marked and transformed a solo test to climb the score to 17-5 for Ayr at pause.
Melrose started the second half-time and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
A long wait took place because of a serious wound from Ruaridh Knott, who left the ground on a civier. At the resumption, Ayr resumed the fronts with a Climo-transformed Stafford McDowall test.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow card and again, Melrose attempted his chance with an untransformed test by Bruce Colvine, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team took over and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having tacled Climo while he did not have the ball, since the touch of the penalty, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's apple, which was progressing.
Climo turned the test, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry's wingman away for the fifth home team test.
Still Game Star Launches in Restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-animizes with his long-standing partner on stage, Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the ninth series that comes will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "flowering environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Marines patrol an armored boat in the La Paz Naval Headquarters.
Public buildings build a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazonia, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: "The sea returns to us in law.
Recovery is a duty."
Throughout the entire Bolivia blocked, the memory of a lost coast for the benefit of Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still well present. Just as the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades. Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be issued on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits a positive result," explains Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will take a decision in favour of Bolivia's application. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign transition to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for the re-election next year), also has much to say about the decision that will be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think that there is little chance that the court will decide in favor of Chile. And that little would change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The United Nations entity based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant a Chilean territory, and it has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, perhaps the last four years have even hurt her.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined all the remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very complicated to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring to Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - which remains to date one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get rid of the past."
North Korea affirms that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, said that his country would not defend its nuclear weapons until he would have confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday in the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed about to relaunch a nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after Singapore's summit with Kim Jong Un, the current North Korean leader.
Ri states that it is "chemistry" to think that maintaining the sanctions and opposition of the United States to a declaration that will end the Korean war will collapse the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of meaningful pre-emptive disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's seriousness of giving up an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is discussed.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in order to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the latest trends in curfew, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL pieces to your collection of hats or protect you from the sun to 100%, stop looking.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of hilarious oversized hats during a PE19 parade that honoured the style of the Fashion Week in Paris.
All the more extravagant hats the others invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their sliding pieces into the parades.
Valentino's flagship was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a broad edge that evoked a feather, which covered the head of the mannequins.
The other oversized accessories included jewelry-paddled pastries, a witch hat and even a pineapple. But these pieces were not imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had stitched lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than the High Couture.
One creation looked like a diving equipment, with tubing and glasses, while another was thinking of a molten ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the saddle of the "Bumba", the straw hat on the broad board that the stars tear, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that sells this hard-to-arm hat that flooded social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as large as the swimsuit mannequin that wore it.
The burnt orange fin bag, decorated with fringes and a white leather handle, was the masterpiece of the PE19 parade The Jacquemus Riviera at the Fashion Week in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big beach hats and bags arrive in the shops next summer. The creator has so marked the spirits that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills are essential to the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a school record of excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new results of excellent examination reinforced by a collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are working to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education capable of designing and implementing a school-based curriculum, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to her in her language, you speak to her heart."
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the excellent results of this year's exams, it can be seen that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest rating, A, as well as 72% of students studying German, 69% of students studying French and 63% of students studying Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Languages as subjects are now organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A survey of the UK Employment and Skills Commission carried out in 2014 reveals that among the difficulties faced by employers in recruiting candidates, 17% are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are thus increasingly vital to prepare young people for future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
Regardless of his career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real benefit to the future through this sustainable competence.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not master a foreign language to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have better chances of finding rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages that are considered important to the United Kingdom in the 2020 perspective, including Mandarin and Japan.
Regardless of your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialized staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills necessary for their success, regardless of what the future holds.
It is clear that at present, in a global trading environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who look at LeBron James's beginnings at Lakers in Los Angeles.
Luke Walton, Laker Coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play yet.
"More than one, less than 48," said Walton on the official site of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training, early in the week, James was asked about his pre-season plans, which includes six games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready."
Trump Campaign in West Virginia ( YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump started a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stairways, especially in states such as Tennessee and the Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
The vote to confirm the vacant position in the Supreme Court being postponed, Trump seeks support for the upcoming mid-term elections and prevents Republicans from losing control of Congress in November.
What time does Trump's meeting take place in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the candidates' hearings at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed until one week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings aims primarily to help Republicans win the ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American president thus stated in his campaign that the five meetings aimed to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress control is such an essential element of its program that the President will make in as many states as possible at the beginning of this campaign in charge of election," said Reuters, a spokesperson for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, programmed at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of Pittsburgh's media."
On Saturday, this will be the second trip to Trump in West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is in the process of polling.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to relaunch it in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political science specialist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope in the approach of simple Sundays
After three simple, Saturday afternoon foursomes could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The swing swing swing movement is a sports concept invented from all the pieces but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever during tournaments like this one.
Where, then, would they find the momentum now?
"They took six points in advance and now four, so that gives us some wings," said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel that they have a bit of a doll wind and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and can strive to have each three out of four points.
Spieth has shown himself terribly effective from tea to green and set the example.
The screams of energetic joy intensified as his game advanced. A crucial putt allowed him to equal to the fourth part while Thomas and was led two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game at the 15th hole, sparked a similar scream, from those who tell you that he believes the American team always in high school.
"You really have to stay determined and focus on your game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these players right now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the story of the Ryder Cup attests.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four matches and has no right to error.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones not to realize a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped there Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd deliriously designate them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari, to whom a potential European victory will be rediscovered while the sun falls on the National Gulf.
Preferably, the two at the same time at different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, hero of the fourballs in the morning, while he was teaming up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two double on the first nine blows sent Spanish and Swedish into a hole they could never show up.
On the other hand, no one's here on Sunday to help you.
Fourballs and ants are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between pairs, advice they give and those they don't give, and how a strategy can shift into a wink.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made considerable progress over the last day, but this foursome session has also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after it won 10-6 on the United States during the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
The duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari carried the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods in distress, which enabled them to score four points until now.
Determined to retain the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning fourballs, facing a disorderly American team.
The United States demonstrated greater resistance in the ants and won two victories, but they failed to break the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must pick up eight points on 12 Sundays when they are simple to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to pick up four points of aline, while Molinari and him, named "Molliwood" after a failed weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's history to get four points during their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they beat the pair made up of the American beginner Bryson Dechanmbeau and a Woods already tired by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who had tossed during the two matches on Saturday, had some shined, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the forsomes, winning 2-1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three respectively in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, within a fresh but clear time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the reference for the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the furballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the forsome, they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simplicity, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, had to do nothing but play a game to keep its trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea states that disarmament cannot become unilaterally untrustworthy.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions strengthened its confidence in the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology
"But we see no corresponding response from the United States," he regretted.
In the lack of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are the first to disarm unilaterally."
While reiterating North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took step-by-step action, its statement was important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made in Singapore on 12 June at the first summit between an American President and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed to working for a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and increases pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even in opposition to the "declaration of the end of war".
"Those who think that these sanctions can cause us to rain don't know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust."
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was put before the United Nations by the American leader earlier this week.
The minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: "If the party concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a deadlock."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he had stated before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point the North Korean missiles on North American territory after President Trump had qualified Kim as a "male man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations last year to “completely destroy” North Korea, did not praise this year for the courage with which Kim applied disarmament measures, but added that much remained to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that no time frame has been set. "It may take two years, three years or five months; it is not important," he said.
China and Russia maintained that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council that: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until the total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made, but in the hours following, North Korea denounced its "gangster methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean president, Kim demands the security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to standardize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students Take Rest Courses
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all first-cycle students to sleep more and fight against the growing Machistic trend that involves studying as a caffeine consumption all night.
A professor noted that most of the students at the best university in the world can't take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of the kind in the United States.
It is after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea has come to him
In the end, a student approached me and said, "Why do I only get told in the past year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of Health Services at the University, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The hour of course consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee fees, curtains, basketballs, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical benefits and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how the lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not instantly change the behavior of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know this information - in the same way you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health is," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of " spending a white night" still exists, and he adds that modern technology and growing pressure on students constantly make sleeplessness a growing problem.
Having adequate sleep and good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid taking weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in mode of inanition, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and moved him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to offer all third-cycle students to follow a similar curriculum before joining the renowned institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students predict an alarm for both bedtime and waking time, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleeping disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The goal of Menga is to kick Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered a new blow outside, Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disarticulate team to Livingston towards a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team hoped to record its first victory on the move from his 4-1 triumph in February to St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted on Gerard his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team drifting, eight points behind Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises in third position, right behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which swept Ayr in half-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, chose the same Livi 11 that pulled out a point in the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see that his well-trained team suffocated his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the balloon, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored in two minutes, when the first shot of Menga sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle of the field let his chance pass.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but his team-up defender Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have received a penalty after the free coup when Steven Lawless and he was caught in a collision, but umpire Steven Thomson dismissed Colombian's demands.
The Rangers took advantage of only two shots in the first period, but the former guardian of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria hit.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute was recorded against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed at Jacobs' kicking.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard reacted in mid-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange nearly had an immediate impact when the wingman appeared in front of Morelos, but impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston has nevertheless continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long bullets on long bullets.
Holt's team could have taken the advantage in the last few moments, but McGregor did well to push Jacobs before Lithgow passed the goal.
The Ranger Replacer, Glenn Middleton, once again called for a penalty at the end of the game while he was in contact with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of our Almanach "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE COMPTEUR TOURNE... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm " Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as the Geiger counter.
Science pillar since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "He's a Geiger meter, used to look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, the effects of atoms released into minerals can be really heard by radioactivity."
Evans: "Say, then, it sure goes down there!"
" Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells and kill them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting and modifying immune cells from a patient in a laboratory
They can then "detect" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose aim is to learn the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting and modifying immune cells from a patient in a laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and finally re-injecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein "leads to an increase in several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and colorectal.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to "learn" to target cancer cells, has been demonstrated in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
A MAGA helmet coiffé, Kanye West began in a Pro-Trump diatribe after passing to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West boasted on the stage after a heated performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to be in the elections in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang by wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West took the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times, I speak to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if racism worried me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL show started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been broadcast, the recording of West's diatreb has been relayed on social media by comedier Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his helmet.
“ They pressured me.
They told me not to come with this cap on the head.
They pushed me!
And then they say I'm in a gouffer," he says, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the gouffer?" and said he would wear his superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions to him. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted him from the public at least twice, and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, reports Variety. A person on-site told the magazine: "A silence of death has fallen on the whole plateau."
West had been called for the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, including the former boyfriend, the Mac Miller rapper, who died a few days earlier.
West dissociated many by singing song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "In one of the most courageous minds: TENU'S TEENU TEST TO THE FOUR."
But Karen Hunter, the show's entertainer, tweeted that West was simply "loyal to himself, and that's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his art) who, in my view, adopts and pours out a bad ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogg rapper named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fire, which changed his name as a symbol, then that of the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast: Indictment of attempted murder after assault on the white weapon in a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.

Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes care of the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a final blade, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent medieval fantastic series.
But the 31-year-old actor took the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to get turned into tough leather to be respected.
In an interview given to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit indicated that he said "something is wrong" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, also 31-year-old covedette of Game of Thrones, confessed that he had "firmly" to address this question.
"Personally, I think deeply that we have abused masculinity."
"What lessons have we taught to young men who become adults in relation to the problem that now arises?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What behavior is innate, what behaviour has been implied?
What does television and the street teach young boys who are encouraged to think that they must behave in this way to be a man?
I believe that this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change this?
There's obviously something that's wrong."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do prologues or follow-up when the series ends next summer, claiming that he had finished with "the battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will be the star of a return of True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life now," he says.
Rose interspersed Ygritte, the character lover of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, Leslie's family domain.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase of 14 per cent in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are involved.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were infected in sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was virtually zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese Government has promised since 2003 universal access to drugs against HIV.
Maxine Waters denies that a POP employee has disclosed information about senators, and denounces "hazardous lies" and "complet theories".
On Saturday, the US Republican Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of her team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by experts and "extreme right" websites.
"Talk lies, lies, and still infamous lies" reacted Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It would appear that the disclosed information included the addresses and telephone numbers of American senators. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted Thursday by an unknown in Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of messages was associated with Waters' office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information."
"This false allegation is completely false and a true lie."
Waters' statement quickly gave rise to online criticisms, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press release.
"This is a denial of anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that it does not have the temperament necessary to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
She shouldn't be provocative.
It must not challenge the accused's motives.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters in the mid-term elections, also spoke of his reflections on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters indicated that his office had warned "the authorities and services responsible for the enforcement of the relevant laws" about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English has hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, undertended spy
It has now become a tradition of looking for Brexit's scope in any new British film and it seems to apply to this resume of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and remade surface in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satire on the question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes etched and rubber face, saw his licence renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English cinematic audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts of glamorous charm, has a bit of Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the type that performs a small note in Les Chariots de ferre during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
Originally, he was also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in the TV ads Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has a friendly moment or two.
I liked Johnny English as he approached a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and impossible Mission make up themselves in full confidence with comedy.
Humour seems to be more directed towards children than toward adults and, for me, Johnny English's far-flung adventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's silent film gags in Bean's character.
The constant premise is that Britain has serious problems.
An IT pirate infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great disarray of agents in service - a weakly large role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the verge of the crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this almost-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to get under the stage.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means you have to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a school teacher, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some beautiful jokes here, because English proposes a spying academy like Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-term partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, who create great trouble for Her Majesty's secret services, look at the action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the influence of the technological billionaire charismatics that is said to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of tedious jokes: under the disguise of servers, they set the fire to a brilliant French restaurant; they create chaos by flapping on the luxurious sailboat of Volta; and English triggers a true anarchy when he tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
All the stops are secured for this last sequence, but still, there's not bad things for the kids in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't help but think, as for Johnny English's other films: Can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really enhance his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to have developed a plan for the British to be able to work four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party needs to examine a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by providing them with an additional day of leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while continuing to pay the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would agree with the party's economic programme and plans to guide the country for workers.
The passage to a week of four days was approved by the trade union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not happen in one night, but a four-day working week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalance the economy for workers and with its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week does not constitute a party policy and is not envisaged by the Party."
Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to give details on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to resume power in the hands of "anonymous directors" and "profiters" in public utilities.
The plans of the alternate chancellor also provide that current shareholders of the water companies may not recover the full amount of their delivery as the Labour Government could operate "deductions" due to alleged deviations of conduct.
It has also confirmed its plan for the integration of workers into business boards and the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private enterprises to employees, which will cover up to £500 of dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy entrust to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The final vote on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was postponed from at least one week after the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a widespread Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the 60-minute program, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"As I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Have you done this?"
It was resolved, determined, without error."
However, Graham's vote appears to be engraved on the stone.
"I made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr.Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," Graham added, alluding to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she named have not been able to verify it.
It's a 36-year-old affair.
I see nothing new that changes.”
What has the Global Citizen Festival done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star-marked and equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now at its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people running to Central Park's Great Lawn in order not only to benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the festival, namely ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is an extension of Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively combat it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, telephoneing or doing any other useful effort to raise awareness of the population in the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really allow them to be persuaded to call for action, or is it just another example of "preclectivism" - a situation in which people really think to make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements from its shares, including a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or lifted.
The group believes that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed themselves to "help children develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda a 35 million pound assistance to end malnutrition in that country after receiving over 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," told the group Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the The Power of Nutrition program at a concert that took place in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following over 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, as the great civil rights movements and the fight against apartheid before us, we will do so, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could call on the Navy to create a "block" to block Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the American Navy, revealed Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russia's presence in Syria - in particular, where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext that enables it to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the "Energy Consumer Spokesman" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in fact identical.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying that it has "more than one string in its arc" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements came at the time when the Trump administration committed itself to boosting the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To this end, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the "inappropriate" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin "prisoner" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that North Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the current capacity for up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech delivered in September in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Energy Secretary, the Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said "I believe that we share this view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has provoked negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of taking part in the 2020 presidential elections, says the Massachusetts Senator
Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public assembly in Holyoke, in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would plan to introduce herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top," she says, The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider submitting my candidacy to the Presidentials."
Warren said what she thought about President Donald Trump at the public gathering, claiming that he "led this country in the wrong direction."
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a Twitter message, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters are not of the opinion that it is expected to take place in 2020.
According to the survey of the Political Research Centre at the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" Massachusetts voters stated that the Senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of democrats very much for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin evokes Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in connection with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is currently experiencing, what he is feeling at home, I can connect him to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some injuries with which our soldiers are returning," she told the public at the meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa in Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "taboo subject" and said about his son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering whether they would respect what their comrades and members of the air forces, and each other military, gave to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and conjugal violence against a woman, which interferes with a relationship of domestic violence and the possession of a drunk weapon.
18 States and the Columbia District are in favour of a judicial dispute over the new asylum policy
18 States and the Columbia District are in favour of a judicial dispute over the new US policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, in Washington, representatives of the 18 States and the district filed a memorandum in favour of an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs," had assaulted her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy annulled a decision issued in 2014 by the Board of Appeal of Immigrants, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law states that all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said amicus curiae in his memory.
The lawyers also argued in the memory that the policy of refusal of entry of immigrants affects the American economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing marital violence and gang violence in June.
"Alas is granted to persons leaving their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political convictions," Sessions, on 11 June, in its announcement of the said policy.
"The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people encounter every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
"I feel very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her fiebrous little boy in Palu, in a city evacuation center.
"At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen to go to their destroyed homes, to pick up scraped property and to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulder, rested in front of the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to strong persistent responses.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," said Haris to Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" by means of "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper has spent a four-page advertisement boasting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the supplement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of attempting to join the US parliamentary elections on 6 November, an accusation that China rejects.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to join the U.S. elections, Trump pointed out what U.S. leaders said Reuters was a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures aimed at hitting state exporters such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion article published in Sunday's Les Moines Register, "is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a paid advertising into the Les Moines Register," says Branstad.
"On the other hand, at the Beijing press window, you will find few opposing voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the disturbing Chinese economic trajectory, as the media firmly obey the Chinese communist party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying what newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are drawing electricians on the approach to the mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the next mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, said "we cannot go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favour of an FBI investigation were sufficient to calm the anger of the voters.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said last September, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters sang "The month of November comes!" in the Senate corridor, while Republicans in the Judiciary chose to move ahead with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be taken away," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in suburban electricians and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, even if they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction might be alive if the Republicans were to advance the confirmation.
According to NBC News, the former president of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week that "it became a mess for the GOP."
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh. It is also the way in which Republicans managed the situation and the way in which they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps the elected Democrats, on the television newspaper.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans appear to be divided on the credibility of the two parties, a small majority on the latter's side.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41 per cent of the people consulted believed in Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35 per cent said they believed in Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 per cent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates the allegations made by Ford and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, following the pressure of Senator Flake.
Ford testified by oath last week before the Senate's Judicial Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while being drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the candidate to the Supreme Court would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's Solid Free Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as those who are allowed to access such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee stated by joking that Inrut was intended to "lord the world."
"We must do it now," he said about the launch.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The particularity of the on-line personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working on the project and a community of voluntary coders.
From this week onwards, technological developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that his team and they are not yet in conversation with " Facebook and Google" in order to know whether or not a complete change is required where all their business models are completely camouflaged in a moment.
“We do not ask permission for them.”
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission [d'Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid."
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although he launched Inrut, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann : Celebration of a First World War ecclesiastical decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only churchman of the Church of England to have received the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and did not know that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was "brightly symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after the operation of his grandfather.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under the violent fire of campaign cannons and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the firing line and, with the "best bravery", he drove the line before jumping a campaign cannon to himself and suffocating three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "a thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that many people will give him."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed awake all night watching Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent all night watching a 206 Bellator well filled, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event had 13 combats, of which six were on the main record, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face up, United Kingdom viewers were rocked when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to stay awake until early in the morning, especially for the fight.
A Twitter supporter described the children's animated drawing transition as "a kind of bad joke."
Regarding the transmission, the Chief Marketing and Communications Vice-President at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation states that at 6 o'clock in the morning, this content was not appropriate, so they had to dump to the children's programs."
"Peppa the Pig", yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the recast, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning, and we can't find a solution before Sunday, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program went down, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government question.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to give more for fans and we have wasted everything.
It's a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" about sexuality
The Olympic divers Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling less than others because of their sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old boy said he didn't realize before going to high school that "everybody [was] not like me."
As part of the first Radio show 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young's usual show presenter took several months off because of her illness.
Appeared as shipwrecked in Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "These feelings of being inferior and different today are the real things that have given me the power and strength necessary for my success."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about their sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he continued.
The dual Olympic bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and has benefited from his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was expressing himself because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to restore "hope" to others.
The world's triple champion claimed that he "was not expecting" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said he was confident that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had the same up and down.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his entire perspective" had changed.
"If you questioned me last year, I thought only to win a gold medal," he says.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 following a brain cancer.
Daley stated that his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be sitting in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: "Father, you won't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and he was dead to finally admit that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, he was inspired by his first choice of song - Proud of Heather Small - which accompanied him in preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the flesh of the chicken.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 p.m., BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench Saturday
American Phil Miccelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to go straight away to avoid this unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was dismissed by Captain Jim Furyk from the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the fifth major champion shared his day between the role of supporting and finishing his game at the stand in order to remedy his evils.
He has never been the greatest of the drivers, even at the top of his career. At 48 years of age, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rush systematically punishes the wrong hits.
And as if the course wasn't dubious enough in itself, Miccelson, during the ninth Sunday game, faced Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 single matches, take a good start, the Micchelson game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his trust in his man, but he could not say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, kicked me in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in him.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I expected more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we think we have to do it.
He wants to be there, like all the others."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of Ryder Cup fights.
This could mark the end of a career with the Ryder Cup that has never really reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven demos, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players had the pleasure of measuring themselves to him this week, which was fun to see.
It does much more than play.”
European selection captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the simple last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful journey.
The Danes fought his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesters had five points ahead of the Americans, but finally got up at the top of the ranking with the smallest possible deviation on the finish line, taking it 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop reminding yourself that we were leading a lot to Valderrama; we had a big breakthrough at Brookline, where we failed, as well as at Valderrama, where we won, but fair," Bjorn said, after observing the 2018 ranking, to win the 5-3 win both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Let's do it tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It didn't end before you had the points on the table.
We have a goal, namely trying to win this trophy, and that is where we need to stay focused.
I have always said I focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Ravi of the performances of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be presented and otherwise.
It's great to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're tested at your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message to get to the players, it's to get the best of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, you have to get the best of yourself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as a team member, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have obtained three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of these overhauls of the last day, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before losing at the end of the "Médina's Miracle", where Europe took the victory.
"I remember every word," he explains in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the Captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
"We have important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, exerts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought they should do it, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of taking the counter-attack and will face Rory McIllroy in the first class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole course," Bjorn said on his selections in simple terms.
The new warship of Germany still postponed
According to the local media, the new frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace aging warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to defective systems and exponential expenditures.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesperson, the introduction of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the admiral ship of all new frigates of the Bade-Württemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The vessel should have incorporated the Navy in 2014, but the problems of concern that occurred after delivery have undermined the fate of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Bade-Württemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as certain stolen technologies, such as radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for a period of up to two years outside the docking ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the continuing delays mean that the pre-war-guard ships - which should allow Germany to project its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the frigate cursed F125 made the big headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the ship yard Blohm & Voss, Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy was returning a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the warship unnecessary in the event of deployment on a combat mission.
The software malfunctions were particularly important because the ships of the Bade-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen class.
In addition, it appears that the ship is heavily overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the Marine's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz weigh twice as much as the similar class vessels used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the overall price of the project - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion), compared with 2.2 billion at the beginning.
The problems associated with new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the recent warnings that Germany's naval force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact "short of vessels able to deploy."
The manager stated that the situation had resulted in a snowball effect over time, as the old vessels had been decommissioned but no replacement vessels had been designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Bade-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in the area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these single flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and sopranos as well as long-earned brown bats and Daubenton in the Inverewe Garden in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat screams and the activities of different species.
A map and a report on habitat will be prepared to develop a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as prairie creation and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the perch and leads to the loss of their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as tollpapers and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as company cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to identify insects and obstacles to their flight route.
In charge of the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perch and sometimes rescue inspections.
The organization has also established the first and only reserve of Scottish bats on the site of Thrave in Dumfries-et-Gallow, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, domain manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have an ideal place for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about bats, so that the work we do here and in other places will help us to better understand what the bats need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of verifying the presence of bats before maintaining the properties, because by destroying it without wanting a single maternity nest, the death of 400 females and small females can be caused, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to disturb them, or to destroy their perch.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our bats and about many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations for now."
Ronaldo refutes rape charges while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the charges of rape against him as "misinformation," and claimed that people "want to make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to pursue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He would then have paid him $375,000 to keep her silence on this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
Referring to its 142 million fans in an Instagram live video, a few hours after the spread of the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo described this information as "misinformation".
« No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is misinformation," said the camera the fifth winner of the Golden Balloon.
"They want to get into the pub by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to pursue Der Spiegel on these allegations, which they have described as "inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage proportional to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the rights of the person in recent years."
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel-casino le Palms, Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night box, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would occur, according to documents filed with Clark County court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and assured him to be a "good guy" at "99%" but did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual intercourse, but that they were consented.
Majorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and that pictures of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt "feared by reprisals" and feared "to suffer public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman states that she is now seeking to cancel this regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer, he joined the Italian giant Juve in a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "never regret" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the United Kingdom would "never regret it" if it had lost its position as world leader in the car construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant, near Derby, if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of border delays on the eventuality of an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, has built nearly 150,000 automobiles last year, of which 90% have been exported to other European Union countries.
"I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what car manufacturers qualify for risks to the Brexit supply chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in "tense flow", parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured on order.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, there could be border disturbances which, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortage of coins.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory more than one day at her Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Checkers Plan for Future Relations with the EU is "specificly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to benefit from the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only of Toyota but of other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has proved to be an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota had not been able to specify how long the production would be stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the United Union factory and who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a specific and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
La Maison-Blanche announces that the Trump and Rosenstein meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "rejected for a week", while the struggle for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser responsible for investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia and the possible barriers to justice exercised by the President.
The question of whether or not Trump will return to the Deputy Attorney General, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, on Monday, he showed up at the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump indicated that he would "not prefer" to send Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate's Judicial Commission before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's press release, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance in Fox News.
Inquired about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we were to postpone for another week given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the press informed."
The statement would be challenged by some journalists: Since 10 September, Sanders has not held any press conferences at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the scarcity of lectures was not due to an aversion to "demagogic" television reporters, although she said: "I have nothing against the fact that they're breaking the gallery."
She then made it clear that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without quoting evidence, she added that "the president participates in more questions-and-answer sessions than any other president before him": "We have checked the figures."
Press conferences will always take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to directly question the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it frequently, you have seen it well in recent weeks, and that will take the place of a press conference where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It's rare that there are press conferences on the ground.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, making a casual appearance and at times a strange appearance in front of the gathered journalists.
Regarding the fears of Brexit, the Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude for the country and to wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of applications for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "In the summer negotiations on withdrawal continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should lead to decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each one of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate the extent to which I consider the contribution of each staff member, irrespective of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is exactly your home and we really want you to stay here."
After having had a head injury, Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, from Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennesian Tigers second, was operated urgently after a head injury on Saturday during the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of the State of Tennessee, told the journalists that the injury had occurred just before mid-time.
"It came on the touch line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a crime scene and taking it to another test.
A representative from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris stated that "there were no further details on the type or extent of the injury" and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an athlete in the second year, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five plates in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total of the season to 18 placards.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp right if they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees if they purchase property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people under new conservative regimes
This will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million Pounds a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp rate if they buy property in the United Kingdom - extra money will help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by committing themselves to providing more affordable housing and targeting people with high incomes.
The increase in stamping duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will serve to strengthen the Government's efforts in the struggle to help homeless people.
This overtax - which is added to the current stamp right, including the highest levels introduced two years ago on secondary residences and rentals - could be up to 3%.
Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the new London constructions are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which causes prices to climb and prevents first-accessors from taking a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who reside most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a reduction in stamping rights in order to help more young people acquire a first house.
Accusing large construction companies to maintain real estate prices at a high level by taking over unutilized land, he invited Ms. May to renounce the quotas on affordable housing with a view to resolving the " real estate disorder" that exists in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including the control of rents and the removal of "no blame" evictions.
The Committee also wishes to give advice on the wider powers to build new housing.
Ms. May said: "Last year, I said that I would devote my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house as well as for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become remote and the misery of homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland Technician Jack Ross explains that his "final ambition" is to become the Scottish picker at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is pleased to meet the challenge of reborn the North-East club, which currently occupies the third place of League 1, three points from the leader.
He rallied the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren into the Scottish First League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," said Ross at the BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But I grew up following Scotland's games in Hampden with my father and it's one thing I've never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would come about only if I succeeded in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's pickers are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Technician of Alloa Athletic states that he did not hesitate to stay behind such iconic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "can I bring this club back to Premier League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it is undoubtedly the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably not consider myself a success here if I could bring the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach in Hearts.
He then helped Alloa resume a third division relegation and transformed St Mirren, who was on the verge of the relegation, into a major winner of the championship the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
The support of Alloa was probably a real crossroads, he recalled.
"I really thought being a coach was better than playing.
It seems strange because I got out of it, that I won my life well, and that I took advantage of some valuable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There's a lot of detail to deal with every week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and stress at work, but being a coach is doing very well.

According to a survey, the ideal time for paint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer canicle raised the revenues of British pubs in difficulty, but increased the pressure on restaurants chains.
Figures indicate that groups of bars and pubs recorded an increase of 2.7% of their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting firm, who compiled the data, said: "Permanent insulation and longer participation from England to the World Cup have made the month of July follow the June model, where bars had increased by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which have suffered even more shock.
The decrease of 1.8% in the restaurant sector in June was only beginning in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are used are by far the most in vogue, with more similarities than the restaurants that are falling.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as the restoratives.
Looks like people just want to go out and get a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% per month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an expert on recreation and RSM hotels, said: "These results have been following the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in the out-of-home market sales.
There is no wonder that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decrease in sales by 4.8% on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less convenient for food business operators and time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we have known in August will give a well-deserved summary."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in implantation.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds Sterling and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, a child in five has secret accounts that he hides from his parents
According to one survey, a child in five - some of whom are only 11 - has secret social media accounts that he hides from his parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta" pages
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "main" account to show their parents
A child in five - some of whom are only 11 - opens an account on social media that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth of the "false Insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a "main" account that was cleared to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "violent me".
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11-18-year-olds have a double profile, half of the students appreciate private accounts.
CSM Leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers don't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Executive Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for this sport's leaders to make use of his extensive international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from his participation in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after having suffered a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell me whether I would be restored or how.
It was a trying job, but I got it all back, I learned to walk again, and today I do exercises of agility!

On-line advertising on milk that compares mothers and cows divide opinions
An online advertising of a company offering a milkshaft compares mothers breast-feeding to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called the "first silent milking in the world," Elvie, a large-scale technology company, has launched a bold advertisement inspired by a music video to show the freedom that her new milking offers to nursing women.
In a herd of cows filled with hay, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I betray myself, but you don't see tails" and "If you hadn't noticed it, it's my breasts, not my breasts."
The refrain continues: "Pump him, pump him, feed the babies, pump him, pump him, pump him, help women bring milk."
However, the advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received conflicting reactions from the public, many of whom say it shed light on the " horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A poor decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth," wrote one of them.
Elvie's milkshake is adapted discreetly in breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another made comments: "It's an understandable trauma for mother and baby.
But yeah, why don't you use them to advertise a milkshake for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added: "An ad so disconnected."
Others defended advertising, for example a woman who admitted that she found the song "hilarious".
"I think it's an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping gave me the impression of being a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a fun commercial for mothers who pull their milk (often on their workplace or toilets) and feel like cows."
It is not an advertising that praises the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they have danced with the discrets, hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the milk can say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milking is completely silent, with no threads or pipes and discreetly inserts into a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even come out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: "Elvie's milking is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a daring and provocative launch.
In a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk will provide.
This is not the first time Elvie's milk is made in one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski as she used this product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have quietly settled in a camp at the border of Texas
The number of detained migrant children has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly due to the fact that the Trump administration's harsh speeches and policies have made it possible to complicate the placement of children in respondents.
Traditionally, most of the respondents were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they feared to compromise their own ability to stay in the country with regard to the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their homes should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the persons arrested did not have legal records.
" Nearly 80 per cent of respondents or family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Mr.Albence.
According to the asylum authorities, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear before the court in the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to argue their case with regard to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons who are found not to be eligible will be expelled quickly.
According to the speakers and reports presented in recent months by the shelter network, the longer the children remain in detention, the more they are likely to become anxious or depressed, which may result in outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large institution such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to the child's rights defenders.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare themselves emotionally or saying goodbye to their friends could heighten a trauma that many have a hard time to manage.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw on the spot.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they "would be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have been uprooted from their homes.
He indicated that Damascus would continue "to carry out this sacred battle until all Syrian territories were purged" both of the two terrorist groups and of any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom form and advise both the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on site.
Mualem said about the refugees, who were in favour of their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “promoting irrational concerns” that dissuaded the refugees from returning.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would be concluded.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress of Idlib has led to progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and expressed the hope that military measures would target the jihadists, in particular the combatants of the Nusra Front, who are related to Al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, claiming that the group's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many Liberal viewers would probably expect, his removal and scandal led him to leave his presidency prematurely.
This would probably be "The most spectacular final of a presidency!"
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, high-time ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million large-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million large-time viewers, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something we understand," commented Neal Baer, presenter of the dramatic series of the ABC "designated Survival" that speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an exciting comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about slipping into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She recalls taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did she ask him?
"He replied, "Because he made me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has a funny value.
Obviously, contrary to everything on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most successful viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one comes to looking at a panel of experts for six hours to discuss how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his "Fear" book on Paul Manafort's leather vest at 15,000 dollars ("a clothing full of pride" according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered from, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
On my side, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"If a part of what he's doing seems to be watching a TV show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's changing teams and daily feedbacks (to fight with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode or we're in the train.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at his home on the North bank of Kauai, but he was sitting inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was preparing to face the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when we had all these crazy shows and people were saying, "It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some sort of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside invades the tightest half-manda elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania was flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of the electoral districts of Congress which allowed two incumbents to dispute the same seat.
This recently restructured suburb of Pittsburgh is the seat of the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who has moved his seat to another constituency during the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured by another licensee, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a strong influence on the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former arrondissements were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district gave rise to a confrontation with regard to the financing of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a successful victory in March last year in a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been owned by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing Salvador for its support for China, and then withdrew
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington did not oppose.
Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the State Department decided to convene the heads of US diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
However, sanctions have been provided only against Salvador, which has received US assistance estimated at $140 million in 2017, including for drug control and development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial assistance and visa-based restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings continued, representatives from North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials clearly indicated that they wanted the conference to continue, thereby ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has now spoken at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in order to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats have made known.
And the three U.S. emissaries are calmly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
Their statements were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Study History
The next issue could be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation into the question of a conjugation of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will find himself in the obligation to render accounts before this body, at the time he is ready to represent himself before the electors and, perhaps, before a jury made up of his peers.
These are many "yes", and I do not claim that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable - nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had kept him in mind and pushed the Czechoslovakians to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the following carnage years.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation conducted by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that, last year, he proposed to register the president in secret and issued assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times report is inaccurate.
"What will we say if the recently asked FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confined to the Supreme Court despite accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, shall we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will call for accounts to Mr Trump?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will spend a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light weekly candles on the swastika board.
With this heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, confidant against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive null match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify as Group G in the League of Europe.
A knee injury has deprived the midfield Graham Dorrans of his first participation of the season until the game null 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the best of such a result to realize exploits.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," said the 31-year-old attacker.
"We got into the game thinking about getting something, and we left with one point.
We might have been able to take it to the end, but overall, a null match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we returned in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they did a good result during their last game, however I am sure that we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and changes to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; training is quality.
Let's hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer sleep because of this fear of withdrawal
Although the participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people raised the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't do what they need to have this conversation," explained Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Branch.
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouses and children about this: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your decisions on long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a purchase value to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your heritage - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the passage.
Provide health care services that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a proxy for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and will ensure that you pay your bills if you are unable to do so.
Think about the details: Suppose your old parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"There is not only the finance that is at stake, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place.”
A man was wounded several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man received several shots shot with a compressed air gun as he would walk back to a night.
The victim, aged about 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove region of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in his chest, belly, and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2.30 p.m., as a random act.
The victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police appealed to witnesses.
Seisms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, announced to the authorities, and the balance sheet should fly.
As communications were paralysed, relief services were not able to receive any information from the Domanga Regency, an area located north of Palu that is more close to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
A few essential facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Dongalaka is a regency that is more than 300 km (180 miles) from coast to the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, and particularly of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck west of Dongala in 1996, resulting in nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years include:
2004: A major earthquake, which took place on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, causing 226 000 victims on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from the end of March to the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude earthquake of 6.8 reached southern Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 victims.
2009: A magnitude earthquake of 7.6 rocked the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake shook the regiment of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the earthquake and killing tsunami of 2004.
No tsunamis have been caused this time, but more than 100 people have been killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes rocked the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was interviewed for suspicions of spousal violence, violating a report of marital violence and resisting arrest, as reported in a press release published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone from a woman's acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in pre-trial detention in Mat-Su's pre-trial detention centre and is held in non-secured custody of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, it is certain" when his plea was asked, announced the network.
Palin is facing three Class A offences, which means that he could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to a year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor offence of class B, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is under way before the Alaskan Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a drunk weapon in connection with the incident.
His companion had claimed that he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking his son's violent behaviour with PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Seism in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people died following the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are failing and the victim's balance sheet is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake was declared just off the centre of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos on social media show the point of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami broke down on the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death penalty for a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal Attorneys in New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York Assailant who has caused eight victims - a rare penalty that has not been applied in that State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, would have used a truck rented by Home Depot to attack a cycle track on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, on its pedestrian and a cyclist road last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov "intendedly" murdered the eight victims and inflicted "intendedly" serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty filed with the Southern New York District.
These two charges are likely to lead to the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury sentenced Saipov to 22 charges, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a careful preparation and a premeditation," the prosecutors claimed, calling the method used by Saipov "Holy, Cruel and Debased".
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South New York district had not claimed the death penalty in the course of prosecution for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case concerning Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed to engage in conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the cold war.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months after the tragedy, according to court records.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been urged to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display Daesh's flag in his hospital room, specified the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "of course disappointed" in the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than to accept the plea of guilt and to condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party stated that politicians should "feel the pressure" of Euroseptics - as one of the Members of Theresa May suggested, he should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
Mr Peter Bone, a late-ban Conservative MP, said during Birmingham's march that the United Kingdom "would have already been released" if Mr Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the dilemma that Mrs May faced to reconcile her deeply divided troops was emphasized by the Conservatives in favour of staying in the Union, which joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty in maintaining his Czech compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay, as well as the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its efforts to reach agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and would require Euroseptics and workers to choose between its programme and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Leaves Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted "to get rid of Checkers".
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be given the burden of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would already be out," he said.
The Member of Parliament of Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Checkers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not delivered ourselves to world wars to submit ourselves.
We wish to make our own legislation in our own country."
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people turned the page and wanted to stay is completely false."
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of the exit, was also present at the walk to tell journalists: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Even if the general public is not appreciated, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who silence the streets and make us elected above all.
Abandon Checks and start listening."
In a message directed to Ms May, she added: Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they honor their promises."
"Mr Farage told the assembly that politicians should be moved to "press" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They are trying to deceive Brexit and we are saying to them today: "We will not let you get away with it."
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to feel the pressure of our political class that is about to betray the Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has enabled us to win the win in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, pro-European followers walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in downtown.
A small number of militants branded conservative banners against Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of the security issues relating to the Party's implementation at the beginning of the conference.
"They assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all technology for Canada, plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to give serious consideration to the possibility of presenting himself to the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed its future on Saturday at a public assembly in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequently critical voice with regard to President Donald Trump, presents himself for the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, GOP representative in the States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the center of speculation that Trump could face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked whether she intended to appear in the Chair.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman at the head of the state."
Arrest at the time of Sims' death by bullet from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, Baton Rouge Police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting of the Wayde Sims basketball player, LSU, Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 a.m. HE. Press conference.
On Friday, they had published a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who was on the images.
Sims, 20, was killed by ball Friday morning, near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims received a bullet wound in the head and got killed in his injuries," said Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul on Saturday to the media at 247 sports.
Wayde took the defense of his friend and was killed by Simpson.
Inquired, Simpson admitted to being in the area, in possession of a weapon, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the eastern Baton Rouge police station.
Sims, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, of which 10 as a part of the last season, and totaled 17.4 minutes on average, 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton headed for the world title after the team's guidelines enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became obvious from the moment Valteri Bottas qualified in anticipation of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that Mercedes's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and lined up Hamilton on the flank while defending his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to throw himself into the tower at the poloton's tail, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes passed through the booths a later round and found herself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage after a wheeled action that saw the Ferrari driver leave the inside to counter the risk of resisting after a double defensive attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21 years.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tires to aim for a speed arrival and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived at the booths at the 44th tower, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight towers, Raikkonen pointing fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate's judicial commission, but he argued that the events in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the Senate these last days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"Looking at the disclosures and leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking about the senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter from Ford last July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place early in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein said to the committee, The Hill.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday evening at the gathering: "I'll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
In pursuit of his defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to resume power by all means.
You see wickedness, mischief, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control," said the president at Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars wiped out their Friday defeat in Elite League against the Giants of Belfast by cutting off the game back 5-3 in Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score thanks to two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought equality back home before Dwyer gave the Giants the advantage.
François Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen registers two goals, ensuring their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday evening in Belfast, after being caught.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants who triumphed during the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage to the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the set four minutes later.
During a first well-loaded period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt went to the service of Cownie at 15:16, with equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advance before the first break when he struck his second goal of the evening toward the end of the first period.
The local team met and Bouchard again matched with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, thus ensuring the victory to his team by marking a fifth goal at the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will welcome Milton Keynes during their next match Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board an airplane to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many others disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and many people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Grande refused to abandon his position in the tower violently shaken at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he felt it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirat, the spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities are concerned that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the country's disaster reduction agency indicating that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance would continue to grow because many bodies were still under the debris and a large number could not be dried," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency.
Waves measuring up to six metres have devastated Palu who will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide help and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are pillaged everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?," CNN said.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man disappeared after the crash of an aircraft in the lagoon.
The airline that managed the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that a man is being carried away, after the 47 passengers and crew members evacuated the flying aircraft safely.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to more specific requests for information about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local ships took part in the rescue of the other passengers and crew after the aircraft hit the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline stated on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy stated that the aircraft had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses found that the aircraft had crossed the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes stated that he and the others had been able to slip into the water until the aircraft's rescue exits were coming down.
he stated that the on-board officers had panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that the sailors working close to the improvement of a wharf had also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people to the mainland before the aircraft flowed in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
The Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in airline accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the timing of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned his case on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of having burned a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the area of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls from a cell phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night the defendant died.
Rowlett indicated that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones that indicated that Telllis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he had pretended to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford came across the bar on Saturday and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Telllis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers died, Telllis deleted the SMS, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense must begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.
The High Breed : What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by immagining its music of positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the political hip hop again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?!
A New York nanny continues a couple in court for having fired her after a "racist" text
A New York nanny is pursuing a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after having received an error-transmitted message from the mother who complained that she was still "a Black."
The couple refuse to be racist, and equate the prosecution with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed his dismay in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new noun, was Black upon his arrival for his first day of work.
"NOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE A NOIRE," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her two times to Ms. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after having understood her gaffe, "sick at ease," Plasco-Flaxman sent Mrs. Maurice, explaining that their old nun, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she was waiting for a Philippine instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work, then returned home by a Uber.
Now Maurice continues the couple in court in order to obtain compensation under his return and claims an allowance of $350 per day under the six-month home service for which she was initially hired but without a contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do that kind of thing," she said at the Post Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing that he could not be trusted after he had done something wrong.
"My wife sent him something that she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your new baby?
Let's see!"
Associating the trial to an "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you pursue someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," added the business banker.
While the file is still under way, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blame them for their behaviour and their logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveal a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It's hard to put in place someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very amusing, knowing what we know about the enormous success of Paddington."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small teddy bear, would remain optimistic about the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had a taste "sweet-sitter" after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and adds that his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a pretentious man," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we are proud of him, even though it is not really his own realization.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the landing, her daughter had been taken urgently to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, and we didn't expect it to happen," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given him to maintain the heart rate were slowly exhausting and getting out of his system.
She had died a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit here and wait, knowing that this was all going on.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to take the shot."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving of her daughter, rides on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this huge sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Depressed women deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted, on a Welsh bridge, postcards containing inspired messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm forced to feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“ Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm constantly afraid there's a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don’t keep quiet - you have to talk. ”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
"He didn't say he felt down, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She said that her death had represented an enormous trauma for them, but they have to get out of it: "It's tearing up for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh involved as the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for - a limited investigation in time, limited in scope - maybe we could bring some unity," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would "fall" into a partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will take place only in five weeks, or on 6 November. If, as planned, Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called down the telephone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
We do not know yet whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to defuse the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of "fall" deserters under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un, seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Department of Southern Unity, said that 1,127 desertions took place last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing fares demanded by passengers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of Northern deserters will finally be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the very protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and often returns them forcefully.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in the context of talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had so far been pending.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the broad lines, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, charged US sanctions with the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to conduct unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and claims he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "Hysterical" and declared he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had acted this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee of the Judiciary last Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with emotion, denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited and sometimes failed to scream and choke by referring to his family and his school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations of " grotesque murder and coordinated" organized by disappointed Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he took it to Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to detain Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and whether Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he's also unable to sit in the court where he is currently," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi also added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh addressed the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect what we say: "It's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to use them.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that overflow, and she can't get her out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere, who told me that she too wept when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried: "You can think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I found it brilliant."
Tears are allowed as exuberance to anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I found myself crying from an inexpressible rage, was that I had been seized by the skin of the neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always been a bit terrified - who led me into a stairway.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They believe you are sad and glad because they have you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was taken into an extra-husband affair on board a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a highly thought-out decision," she entrusted me with laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing he missed was one more person.
Someone called it "Blanche-Neige and the Seven Nains".
As the campaign was very advanced, it had slowed down in fund-raising, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it had raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually contributed $1,000 to men were only going to give her $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch official campaigns, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she felt it was embarrassing.
"You would have thought I was getting nervous," she remembered about the reaction of the press to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first rescues of the trade war between the United States and China were disturbing, and although the battle was far from over, there could be a long-term disagreement between countries in Beijing, according to experts.
President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest increase this week has occurred with new customs duties affecting items worth 200 billion US dollars (150 billion pounds), thus charging half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Every time, Beijing has returned in kind, striking more recently customs duties of between 5 and 10 per cent of US$60 billion of goods.
China has committed to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will be vacant soon.
Backing Washington, it's giving in to the demands, but publicly giving in to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can properly play its role, the pressures of the American trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions conducive to economic slowdown in one or the other of the countries is in fact much more dangerous than the observers have previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research partner that focuses on Asia, the Center for New American Security think-tank.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks assistance to rebuild that devastated country by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations considers that more than 5.5 million Syrians had deserted the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of that devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the insurrection.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the bar of 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Miccelson, who was in difficulty during most of the tournament, plunged his kick into the water in the 16th hole in par-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all its rounds, becoming one of four players who have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
America's Jordan Spieth was removed 5-4 by the least well-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, bowed 2 and 1 to the English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European Champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today, it's stronger than me.
It was an exciting year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cut back.
What matters is the team, and I'm glad I could help it," Garcia confided with emotion after the European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who beat the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, Sunday last.
"I feel incredible pride, I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost his four games in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 in career in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the biggest golfers of all time, which has won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance on his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hat in Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have all played very well.
We're going to get together, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going ahead.
I love these guys, and I'm proud to be a captain.
We have to lean.
We've gotten ourselves out of the way."
