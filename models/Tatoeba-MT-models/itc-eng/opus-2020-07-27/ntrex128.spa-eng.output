Members of the Assembly (AM) in Wales are concerned "to appear muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are disturbed by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Wales Parliament (MWP) in English.
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this can be ridiculed.
A member of the Assembly of the Labour Party stated that his group was concerned "that he remained with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poo.
A member of the Wales Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "disgruntled" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Wales Conservative Party stated that his group was "open" to the name change, but pointed out that MWP's jump of pronunciation to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in English of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of Members of the Assembly will be the matter of the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Wales Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling Parliament of Wales to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Wales Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option received most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the draft law on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the inability of Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of what should be called when deciding on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the change of name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday about whether your country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy to EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing names is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of San Martín remain silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the older people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is neither one thing nor the other."
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"Now people socialize differently," he says.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that the neighbors regularly go to."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after, they will return to the starting point".
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the type of people who will not help the shrines that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and, therefore, will speed up the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will end up being members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martín a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation was in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation that was worshiping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of San Martín, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to street 125 merchants, a main shopping street of Harlem, who resisted to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while Father Johnson’s parishioners made plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the cart.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in San Martín, proudly called him "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert playing the trolloon called: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, pointed out that it was the first trolloon in the world used by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who went to play the largest cart in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the council, although it had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wounds a 13-year-old who was diving in search of lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the day the lobster season opened, according to the authorities.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed the San Diego KSWB-TV channel that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that at first he thought he was just thrilled to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that "he was screaming that they had bit him

had the clavicle crushed," Hammel observed when he came to the child.
"I thanked everyone who came out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented on a press conference that had seen a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's boost the beauty market of the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's acquire Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the corridors of their stylish and beautiful establishments.
In order to significantly boost the beauty market in the United Kingdom, valued at 2800 billion pounds and with an increase that is increasing compared to the fall of fashionable sales and household goods, the largest beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores all over the country and, if they succeed, the same will be done in more shops next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets seeks ways to use the space on shelves that was used for TVs, microwaves and home-made.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch your Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something more and more demanded by younger customers.
Also, at the fragrance shop The Fragrance Shop will try its concessions at two Sainsbury's establishments, the first recently inaugurated in Croydon, in southern London last week. The second will be opened at Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later this year.
Online shops and the change to daily purchases of small quantities of food in local stores require supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said shops will look more and more like shopping centers while the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discount establishments by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points into hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since their purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted the sales of edible and profitable products plus these acquisitions.
The earlier attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in early 2000, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the sales revenue of pharmaceuticals points into their supermarkets.
The new strategy arises after the sale of 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, a company owned by Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £ 125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, commented: "We have transformed the appearance and environment of our beauty corridors so that they can enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offer is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination of beauty products, challenging the old way to buy."
Peter Jones is "struck" after Holly Willoughby breaks an agreement of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, went "frozen" after television presenter Holly Willoughby broke an agreement of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle business line to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and True plugins.
This business had compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptrew.
This Morning, 37-year-old presenter, announced that she was leaving the Instagram business.
Holly Willoughby infuriated Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the consulted sources, Jones was "furiously" when the television girl admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to £1.5 million, left no time to dedicate herself to Truly, her fashionable brand and additions, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptrew and was profiled as a favorite to duplicate Willoughby's fortune, of about 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, age 37, announced that he was leaving the Instagram business, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one referenced source commented: "Truly was, in contrast, Holly's main priority.
It was to be its long-term future, which would keep it in the next two decades.
His decision to give up left all those involved totally stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters, ready-to-sale products."
Experts believe that the exit of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago they have a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby set up True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
Couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby is going to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an I'm A Celebrity program presenter on the ITV channel.
A source close to Jones said that last night "there was no talk of business issues."
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticisms he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider to be "little presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented with his ridiculous voice of "News presenter."
"I have not given up on anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in rejoining him after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which considered a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have been stagnated.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see a "adequate response" from the United States to the first steps for North Korea's disarmament.
On the contrary, the United States continues to apply sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump’s perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
"We're getting along great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of testing with missiles, help to release hostages and bring the deadly remains of U.S. soldiers back home.
He also defended his unusual approach by talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing out to the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia ravages an island, leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had had to move, no national emergency had been declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which complicates things a little," says Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are still not sure if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide help.
Taking into account that the earth is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami alert sirens in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, may have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, travelling from one island from Indonesia to another poses a real challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital boat in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo converted the improvement of Indonesia's exhausting infrastructure into the central axis of his electoral campaign, and has allocated enough money to roads and railway lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko's administration, which is facing a re-election next year.
In addition, it must face pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while bands of Christians and Muslims were fighting in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equals the marker before Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat at the Premier League in Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to some more than 27 meters from Chelsea's gate when the marker was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second pole.
The action sent him over the area and headed towards the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the balloon passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the network.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to do with the ball and players like Shaq always play very ahead, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge said at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was approaching and gave her a touch. I didn't think too much, just threw the shot."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the minute 25.
The Blues midpoint made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning a regatta near the middle of the field and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle of the field.
Later, he made a nice pass to the space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and finished throwing the ball at the net of the second post with a kick with the left foot that Alisson Becker, from Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, the Liverpool plays against Naples in the group phase of the Champions League. The meeting will be held at St Paul Stadium in Naples, Italy.
For its part, Chelsea faces Videoton at UEFA Europe League Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's emergency agency at the first hour of Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the debris of the buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and that triggered waves up to six metres, according to the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stabs at Grayson Mews, on John Street, which took the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but it would encourage anyone who was near Jonh Street, in Birkenhead, to have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend to any person, especially the taxi drivers, that he could have caught something in Dashcam to contact us, as they can have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This evening some people who believe to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to know where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victims ' family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his apartment, but the police tell him no one can get in or out of the building.
He was perplexed when he found out what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed to return in a few hours.
Someone heard an officer tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
Don't stop repeating "it's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents stood inside the cord controlling the floor block.
Any person who has information is requested to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at number 0800 555 111, record 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last commemorative success by "rewrite history"
Its prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this destruction of the Taliban style of so many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestions as a "crazy" and a "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from Westminster Palace would become an objective.
The iconoclasy of the British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
He may sacrifice himself to Cromwell mistaken for the actions of his ancestors, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to be worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a parliamentary defender in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th century conflict has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy to celebrate and commemorate."
A Killer Pig Attacks a Chinese Farmer
One pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his name "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned, blood-covered artery near a small town in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder prepares to inject vaccines to the pigs of a pocilga in Xining, in the province of Qinghai, China.
Apparently, he traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door of a nearby little girl was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the almost 250-pound pig had attacked the herder to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and crushed," said the cousin, who was directed by his last name, "Wu", to The Guiyang Evening News.
The images of the security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed her pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager informed The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from attacking anyone else, while the police were gathering evidence on site.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they're rare, it's not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in her Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 295 pounds crowded a farmer on his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After a pig farmer from Oregon was eaten in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "disposer".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intent is not to hurt.
What we need to do is have proper respect for them," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave strong widespread rains in the southwest of the United States.
As planned, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains all north of Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa provoked wind bursts of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane from Sunday to 5:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are beginning to emerge, which are moving east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday, a tropical storm will start to push the intense tropical rains toward the north, towards the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when tropical rain hits the approaching low pressure, there will be strong rainfalls in the south-west over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and possible spills in the desert.
The intense tropical rains will cause precipitation of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in concrete areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
They are expected between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Because of the scattered nature of tropical rains, sudden floods may occur with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Due to this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended at all to venture into the desert on foot.
The heavy rains could turn cannons into watery rivers and storms will cause torn winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rains in concrete parts of the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains may leave up to nearly two centimeters of water, which could cause small flows of debris and cause the roads to slip.
This would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaparrons will begin to approach Arizona at the last hour of Sunday and the first hour of Monday, before the rain is generalized at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, there may be some intense changes in temperature in the US due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
This sometimes involves drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. center on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the U.S., a hot October start is expected, with generalized temperatures that will run 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the northeast.
Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures of up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probability of temperatures higher than the average for the east of the U.S. during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's appearance
More than 20 million people followed the heartbreaking testimony that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly happened in the 1980s, gave on Thursday in six television channels.
Meanwhile, politics continued on a dead end and the media disrupted their usual programming to broadcast the latest news of Friday: an agreement designed by the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Blake, for the FBI to conduct an indictment investigation for a week.
Ford informed the Senate's Judicial Commission that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh toked her in a state of drunkenness and that he tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some problems to calculate how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football game of the playoffs or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullian have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fuels the lead channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a show that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS had 3.1 million, the NBC had 2.94 million, the MSNBC had 2.89 million, and the CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the appearance, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a communiqué stating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the CNN and CBS cameras perceived how protesters shouted at him when he was trying to go up to an elevator to attend a court hearing.
While receiving these complaints, broadcast live by CNN, he was shot down.
"Looking at my face," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
And he went on, "You have power when there are so many women who don't. "
Flake said that his office had issued a communiqué and, before the elevator doors were closed, he would count more on his appearance to the Commission.
The cable and radio channels issued everything in live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do it if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate during the next week, which they had been asking for from some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part, of the conversations she had with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made her decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and of undermining national interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives a Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published next to her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted in her attack on the alleged Czechs plan for Brexit, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge the other's tariffs was "totally absurd".
Wayde Murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year basketball player from LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and imprisoned by a second-degree homicide charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police point out that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered their glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, reports WAFB, the CBS subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A security amount of USD 350 000 has been established, depending on the defence.
The District Instruction Judge of Baton Rouge This published a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a bullet wound in the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the runaway unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's sports director, thanked the local police forces for their "dilience and justice."
Sims was 20.
The player, who was over two metres away, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU.
It had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one part of the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, declared that his team is "devasted" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"These are the things that people always care about," Wade said.
A volcano throws ash in Mexico City
Cinderella from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre recorded several tremors and shaking.
On social media, images showed fine layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
The geophysicals have observed greater activity in the volcano, 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters faced the riots while thousands of people participated in opposing demonstrations coincidenting with the first anniversary of the polarized referendum of Catalonia on the secession.
A group of separatists who had been caught by the riots threw eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes in later hours, and the police used pores to contain the fight.
For several hours, independent groups, with messages such as "no forget or forgive", faced unionist demonstrators with the cry of "Viva España".
Fourteen people were assisted by mild injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
The tensions remain high in this region one year after the vote on 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters elected by overwhelming majority independence, although participation was low, as the people who were against secession boycotted the referendum to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent voting at electoral stations throughout the region, where violent clashes occurred.
The groups for independence camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support to the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hope that Catalonia would be independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital, though narrow, victory in the regional elections of last December, the pro-Catalanist parties have fought to retain the momentum this year, since many of their best-known leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in the referendum organization and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"To be a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen of the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested for Blowing a House With a Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly haunting a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday around 7:30 at Ballynegard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that there were damage to access and to the building itself.
At some point, he may have shot himself in the car with a bullet.
An attack by Menga grants the 1-0 victory to Livingston against the Rangers
The first Dolly Menga goal for Livingston secured the victory
A promotional Livingston impressed the Rangers by getting the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 matches as coach of the Ibriox club.
The attack by Dolly Menga marked the difference. Gary Holt's men went up one post, with the Hibernian in second position.
This season, the Gerrards have not yet won any win outside the house and next Sunday they face Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points of advantage.
Before, the Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, the Livingston widens its winning streak in the division to six parties. Holt, incumbent coach, has not yet tasted the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a powerful visitor
Holt's team had to have gone one step ahead long before marking, causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson passed the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the doorkeeper, and then Alan Lithgow was shot in the wrong direction after entering to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the doorkeeper.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems to visitors with the ball-offs.
That was how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston sought an entrance, with a combined game of Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but they couldn't pass the defense of the host and the doorkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite quiet.
That game continued until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos formed a Kelly stop.
Allan McGregor, the Ranger's doorman rejected a shot of Scott Pittman from a kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another Livingston game.
In the Livingston area there were constant long passes, but they were always cleared. Two requests for penalty were rejected, one after a Halkett entry on alternate Glenn Middleton and another by one hand.
Livingston 's Phenomenal (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an ascending trajectory.
His style of play and his template have hardly experienced changes since his rise, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
I was counting on a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they stayed short.
They failed to materialize their moves, as they only managed to get into the opposite field once, which is a call to attention the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received ambiguity in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, in order to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Later, Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters stood in the vicinity to see their president.
There were also hundreds of opponents from Erdogan, many of them Kurds, who condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
These manifestations reflect how divisible this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after collision with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwooked Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded road from Deptford, south-east of the city, around 10:15.
The car driver stopped and the cyclist was cared for by paramedics, but died there.
The accident occurs after another cyclist dies after being hit by a vehicle that fled to Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the site of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Wounded After Disturbing · Global Voices
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation produced in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison department.
The riots started in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. and still continue.
Specialists of an elite team (called "Tournado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, involving eight interns and affecting a pavilion.
Agents received assistance for mild injuries on the face on the spot.
A penitentiary spokesman commented: "It has been deployed to specialized prison personnel to deal with the ongoing incident of Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be placed in the hands of the police and could spend more time between bars."
Long Lartin prison accommodates more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison warden had received hospital medical assistance after an inmate had attacked him.
In addition, in October last year anti-disturbing agents were requested to go to prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City With Sudden Floods (Arid Areas May Be Benefited)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of the week next when the last collections of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest of the desert, at risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada and the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rains at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented on a tweet that only ten hurricanes had preserved their tropical storm or depression on a radius of 321 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached almost 65 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the Huracan National Centre provide between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rains, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollon Scarpe in Arizona.
They are likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas south-west of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places where there is no risk of sudden floods, the rains of Rosa may be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious issue, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the current drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported atweather.com.
First, the itinerary of Hurricane Rosa will rock the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum bursts of 136 kilometres per hour, is 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north to 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's losing strength.
Thus, it is expected that it will stay in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon of Monday.
Strong torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"A torrential rain of between 7 and 15 centimeters from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora is expected to reach 25 centimeters", as reported atweather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Later, he will travel to Arizona south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or its remains is torrential heavy rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the south-west of the U.S. desert," says the National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested as suspects of an attempted murder after another 16-year-old girl had been found with white gun wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stabil".
A 17-year-old girl, two of 18 and one of 20 were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to the Somerset Police.
Agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "suffered the petty and rage" of the Democratic Party
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a rally held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the mesquintness and wrath" of the Democratic Party throughout the whole appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the meeting on this accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, the "Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most successful legalists of our day, a jurist with an admirable record at the service of the public," said West Virginia's followers.
The President made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy in discussing the importance of republican participation in the elections in mid-term terms.
"They take five weeks for one of the most important choices of our lives.
I don't introduce myself, but it's a career," he said.
"That's why I'm going from place to place fighting to get big candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are embarking on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be held no later than Friday, a high office of the leadership of the Republican Party was reported to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in an earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia, the figure is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves that overwhelmed the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, as the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters arrived on the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying it all at its pace.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When it was warned yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Catastrophe Management Agency (BNPB) in Indonesia, in a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, devastated everything on the ground," Nugroho said. The tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He added that some people had gone up to the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken bridges and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas kept hitting the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the great earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the ruined buildings. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and the damage could be higher along the 300 km coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" by Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There live more than 300,000 people," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy of itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although those responsible said that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by a fan and shared on social media, a man is heard who was on the top floor of a building warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
Within minutes, a water wall hits the coast, rising in front of buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large blackout that cut the communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but evacuated people still need food and other commodities.
The city airport has reopened itself for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims by the Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although the staff of World Vision of Dongala have reached the city of Palu, where the employees take refuge under a candles installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, said Mr Doseba.
"They told me they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as the aid groups launched the gears of disaster assistance, some people regretted that the displacement of cooperatives with extensive experience was not being allowed to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, only funding, supplies and staffing of foreign personnel may be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As soon as the Government says that it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it has not yet happened."
By falling the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family members of people who were still missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that brought some light to the desolate stories that write natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, instructor of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had formed two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mr. Mandagei included, were his students.
"By my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the disclosure of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate messages from WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival that was held on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a check mark in grey, not two in blue.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during a recharge of an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves attacked a Brink employee who was charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, raising $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an automatic ATM located in the leisure centre and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While I was busy, another man "appeared to run behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for the recharge.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the place, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will start his name Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West".
For some time now West, 41 years old, is named Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel his performance with "emotional reasons", as the programme creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word was of religious importance to him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West commented earlier this year as he spoke about the album title with the Big Boy radio speaker.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
It was just Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It is one of the many famous rappers that has changed the name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in upper case letters, with or without a dash.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to suppress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rallying throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has committed himself to providing support to young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities led young people to become part of criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, I.A.'s investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments then emerge from I.A. announcements from several parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 innovation in I A. by 2030.
"Dupplicating the budget for I.A.'s research would be a good start, since all other countries go far behind the US.We have the look at the next advance in the I.A. field," says Lee.
Double funding means twice the chance that the next major achievement in I.A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most important companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that won the best U.S. player in Othello. Afterwards, he was executive in Microsoft Research and president of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee granted recognition to the U.S. government's previous technological competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the next one, which would enable the next generation of visionaries to be identified.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to obtain government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired prominent people from universities to work in I. A.
Lee commented that changes in migration policy could also help the US to intensify its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China funds people from academic institutions just as the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations finance American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Center of Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract partners from industrial and academic fields. For its part, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than USD 100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not carried out any action in months.
Macedonians decided on a referendum on whether they would change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided at a referendum on Sunday whether their name would change to "North Macedonia Republic", a gesture that would resolve a decades conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidacy for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name is a claim from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalists argue that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, a majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign had questioned whether the participation would be as low as 50 % required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum paper raised the following question: "Is it in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name-change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, attempting to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijska in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported by 1 afternoon.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% of the last elections to Parliament held in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters deposited their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote at the Macedonian referendum on a change of name of the country that would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scenario and withdrawing chairs in front of the tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We're in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our head up high, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of EuroAsian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would provide much-needed investment in Macedonia, whose unemployment rate was higher than 20%.
"I think the great majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future."
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research, it was ensured that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which meant a lower participation than required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV, from Macedonia, revealed that 57% of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, avoids the entire Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling resold Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City obtained on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the minute 65.
The Argentine midpoint received a midfield pass at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He avoided a defense before overcoming several more at the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass on the left, where Sterling was.
The English lead used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with the right foot to avoid the gatekeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that got to the right side of the network.
"Agüro has some problems on his foot," commented Pep Guardiola, coach of the City, to journalists.
"We're talking about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
However, it was Sterling that gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the First League contest.
The goal arrived in the 29th minute.
In that game, Agüero received the balloon very within Brighton territory.
He made a nice ball pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him some taps before heading to Sterling towards the second pole.
The Sky blues front threw the ball on the net just before getting out of the limits.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a group party of the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena of Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies party
With the Nationals removed from the playoff contest, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the ever competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the Monticle on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, have won against Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League, still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard post thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still pursue their first title of division.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that Denver's audience will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't you want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to let Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his opening number 34, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The history of Washington's right-hand is 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Trump gives a rally in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, speaking of the importance of republican participation in the elections in mid-term terms.
"In November everything we've done is at stake.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's one of the most important. I don't introduce myself, but it's a career, so I'm going from place to place to get big candidates," he said.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see wickedness, evil.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"We've seen it these past four days," he said, saying the Democrats "were furious, they were evil, horrible and false."
He made reference to the Senate Judicial Commission by appointing the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the mouths of the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I'm waiting for an answer.Your body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of views.
It's intolerant with people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a row of members of the Labour Party Parliament to whom you are told that you are not welcome, and just by saying what we think.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, was given a similar treatment to be categorically opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe. It is ironic that these were matters in which Jeremy was at odds with previous leaders.
As was stated in the announcement of the meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham East on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years in which I have been a Member of the Parliament of the Local Labour Party, that is exactly what the evening meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kind" policy is already forgotten, if it really was applied at any time.
It is increasingly clear that discrepant views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether or not the party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he once thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to change his mind radically and adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diathic of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexualist or racist insults every day, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of views and, with each "Censor" motion or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I have received many advice that I was advised to keep my head low and not make me hear so much and that "it would be okay."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a high school student, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my whole school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need it most, whether as a councillor or as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for someone in Nottingham East to ignore my political positions or the areas in which I disagreed with the current leaders.
All I would say to those who promoted Friday's motion is that I do not understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country goes head to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an uninvited Ayr climbs to the top
Two trials at the end of the party may have decided to some extent the final result, but no doubt Ayr deserved the victory in this most entertaining party of the day of Tennent's Premiership.
Now they head the table and it is the only unsuspecting team of the ten who participate.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to make better use of opportunities, which gave the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be content.
"We've been put to the test in all the parties and we're still innocent, so I have to be glad," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose commented: "The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's essay in minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, placed the Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan for the party, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot obtained a non-converted trial.
Climo extended the advantage of the Ayr with a penalty. Before, just in the middle of time, he marked and turned a solo trial, which left the marker in 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
However, the Melrose started the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption by a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, to which they had to pull out a shirt, and, upon resumption of the party, the Ayr advanced with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, Captain of the Ayr, allowed the Melrose to re-use that they had one more man with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the premises recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for plating Climo without the balloon, from the penalti line, MacPherson did a test when he was in the back of the Maul that was moving forward.
Climo converted him, as he had done almost since the party resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent Gregor Henry to the bottom to do with the fifth rehearsal of the premises.
Still Game's protagonist wants to guide his career towards the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move to the restaurant sector after it has been revealed that he has been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC program, who writes and co-protagonizes with his many-year-old comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to make any comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "florely restored market" of Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": a landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific.
Mariners are guarding a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings they wave sea blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by law,
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the desire to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the biggest in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a resolution of the International Court of Justice by October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course is waiting for the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the judgement of the International Court of Justice on large screens distributed throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague court will take action in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who plays a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution of Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the resolution of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Chilean expert Paz Zárate in international law.
Far from promoting the Bolivian cause, it may have been hampered by the past four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
In addition, he suggested that Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold conversations after this.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the court was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered an "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of " bringing an end to 139 years of mutual benefit disagreements," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would use the maritime theme as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, says his nation will never be the first to end nuclear disarmament if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the time when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks on paralysed nuclear matter more than three months after this summit with Kim Jong U, leader of North Korea.
Ri points out that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to submit to the North is a "chemera".
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament movement first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump want to celebrate another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness of giving up an arsenal that the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the delegates.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land on a street store near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, don't look any more.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a large set of eccentric hats for their summer 2019 collection on the gateway, dazzling the style of the Fashion Week in Paris.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other large-sized plugins were sandals with jewelry, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sharp lips and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than the high seam.
One creation reminded a complete diving team, snorkel and glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like the big-sized fashion, you're lucky.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could start to be seen on the street stores.
The big hats come hand-strengthening from "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a wingspan of more than 60 cm used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this unpractical hat that flooded social networks presented another great creation on the gateway: a straw beach bag as large as the bathing model that carried it.
The dark orange ravine bag, decorated with flecks and a white leather handle, was the main part of the collection La Riviera de Jacquemus for the spring-summer 2019 season on the Week of the Fashion of Paris.
As the famous designer Luke Armitage commented at FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach hats and bags on the commercial streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large additions."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental to the citizens of the world
The independent educational centres in Scotland have a history of academic excellence which has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the examinations that are reinforced by individual and collective successes collected in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS) are striving to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak a man in a language you understand, the message comes to his head.
If you speak in his tongue, he reaches his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can observe that the languages are at the highest in the classification tables, being the highest approved rates in the independent schools.
A total of 68% of the students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS centres showed that 72% of the students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of the students studying German, 69% of the French students and 63% of the students in Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages for considering them a fundamental competence that both children and young people will need in the future.
At present, languages are considered to be at the same level as CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that, of the reasons given by entrepreneurs for the difficulties they faced in filling jobs, 17 % were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential employment opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these competences are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last all his life.
The ability to communicate directly with persons from foreign countries will enable that person to move forward automatically to competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
That is why investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If children know a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, they will be equipped to have better opportunities to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools, you can always choose between a number of languages given by teaching staff specialized in this field.
The independent educational centres in Scotland devote all their efforts to provide a learning environment that prepares children and that teams with the skills needed to succeed, whatever their future might be.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as "competences for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron starts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans waiting to see LeBron James kick their first match with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, announced that James will play the opening party of the pre-temporal event to be held on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes you are going to play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on a tweet that James was likely to play a few limited minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the pretemporate program of six Lakers parties.
"At this stage in my career I don't need pretime matches to prepare myself," he said.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five Trump scheduled matches for the next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm your candidate to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court pending, Trump seeks support for the next half-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's appearances of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who were harassed because of the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and have left pending an early Senate confirmation vote during, at most, a week while the FBI investigates them.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections to take on momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign noted that the five next week's rallies aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," says Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we can while we go into the campaign," said Reuters, a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to give his name.
Scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena Stadium tonight's rally could attract supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have coverage in Pittsburgh's media," as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is falling back into the polls.
"For Morrisey it is not a good sign that the president has to come to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates that it dares to fight to keep alive the hope of individual parties on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse oscillating pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So, where would you say the impulse is now?
"They took us six points of advantage and now they take us four, so I guess that can be considered a little boost," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel that they have some wind in favor and reasons to stay excited, among other reasons for the couple made up of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from the tea to the green and preaches with the example.
The guctoral screams of celebration went up as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas went down two after two holes.
The putt that gave them the party in the 15th was received with a similar cry, of those who transmit that they believe that the American team has not yet left out.
"What needs to be done to redouble efforts and focus on the party," Spieth said.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave print.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple in Europe has four of four and nothing can go wrong for them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
This crack and the way it flows its energy with the public bubbling makes it clear that these are the players to be won on Sunday, and that there will not be other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets in Le Golf National.
Preferably, the two at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it remains premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio García, the four-ball hero of the morning, after forming a partner with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and Swedish in a hole they could not get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see them closely because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a great advantage towards the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe moves forward for 10-6 the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup, after finishing fourballs and foursomes with a result of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two victories over a Tiger Woods that was seen in trouble, moving forward four points in the classification of Le Golf National.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy that trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a U.S. team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the ants, winning two parties, but failed to shorten distances.
The American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the nickname of "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quaballs, his magnificent union served to defeat a despondent Woods and the American novice Bryson Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, which in the two games on Saturday had not too much prominence, had occasional moments of shine, but has now lost 19 of its 29 matches of fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the fourballs in the morning, was again Henrik Stenson's partner in the ants, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a result 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
Three times the winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as reference to the Americans, obtaining two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory in front of the Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the two initial holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, that a team recovers from a difference of four points in individual parties only happened twice, although Furyk, as the owner of the trophy, only needs a draw to preserve it.
Although they have been the best seconds for two days, it seems to carry out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says that "there is no possibility" of unilateral disarmament first if they do not have confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened its mistrust in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated to the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing itself to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we received no similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances, there is no possibility that we will first unilaterally disarmament."
Although Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a formula of denuclearization "by stages" that rewards the country as it makes gradual steps, its statement is important, since it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump ensured the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the war in Korea in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted appeals to alleviate international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even by objecting to a declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced to the bombo and plate by the US leader to the United Nations early this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, leader of South Korea in the last five months, adding: "If South Korea had been interested in denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be found in a similar stagnation."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea's missiles to U.S. soil after the "dangerous president" Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim "a rocket man".
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "destruct completely" North Korea last year, praised Kim for her courage in advancing towards disarmament, but said that much remains to be done and that it was necessary to continue to apply sanctions until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, no matter."
China and Russia allege that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue vigorously and without failure until we achieve the ultimate and fully verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not right.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had been progress, but a few hours later, North Korea reported that his "requirements were those of a mobster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "responsive measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
Thanks to a new course given this year at Harvard University, all university students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing machist culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found out that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, it is believed that the first of his class in the United States.
His motivation for starting the course arose after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," commented The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were barely sleeping during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleeplessness on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of infarction, embolism, depression and cancer.
Later, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it's not going to change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that you have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco," said Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride for "to spend the night on the sail" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure that students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough time and a good quality dream should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain create a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the year before during his first year at Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it across the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students think of putting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter the circadian rhythms, so they would end up having problems to stay asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: the goal of Menga tomb the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression outside the house, when Dolly Menga's attack wiped out Steven Gerrard's disarmed team at a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibox wanted to win their first win out of the house since February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team at eight points of Hearts, unearthed leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack took place minutes before half-time and the uninspired alignment of the Rangers was not up to date at any time.
Now, the Rangers go down to sixth position, the Livingston goes up to third, behind the Hibernian for the difference of goals.
The Rangers may be faced with more problems, as the judge of line Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for a head wound after, supposedly, someone throws an object from the visitor's background.
Gerrard changed to eight of the winners who won the party against the Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 Livingston players who started a point at Hearts last week and would have enjoyed the way his highly organized team drowned the competitors at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but the Livingston took better advantage of the balloon when he had it.
They should have marked the two minutes at the beginning, when Menga made a pass into space for Scott Pittman who passed through the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent him out.
Keaghan Jacobs drew a deep gap for Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out for the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been punished in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but arbitrator Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the Colombian's request.
The Rangers got two door-to-door shots in the first half, but the old porter of Ibriox, Liam Kelly, hardly found it difficult to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the boring release of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal marked in the 34th minute by Livingston came against all predictions, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers did not manage to face a deep ball game stopped by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball in for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga to score the goal.
At the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the steering wheel passed it to Morelos, but impressive Kelly left his line to block it.
Still, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the type of game you like, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a corner of head that did not enter.
Rangers' replacement, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty at the end of the party after a meeting with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the counter Geiger
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTAINING... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
Count Geiger, who has since been a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Las bellanas de Coronado", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "He's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting your headphones on, you can hear the effect of waves emitted by the radioactive activity of minerals."
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to be 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the removal of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw how her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a diarium in favor of Trump with a MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was ambushed at the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised the U.S. president, Donald Trump, and said he would be presenting for the elections in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, began to despot against the Democrats and I repeat his support for Trump.
"I often talk to someone white and ask myself how I can like Trump if he's racist.
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have gone from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started Matt Damon's sketch show in which the Hollywood star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate's Judicial Committee in connection with the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, comic Chris Rock went up West's bronca recording on social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that he had been wrong behind bars for wearing that hat.
"They messed with me.
I was told she didn't come out with her hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and he added, "I was going to put on his superman coat, because that meant that no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments were received from the public on at least two occasions and members of SNL appeared to be ashamed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many when he went on stage singing I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: GRANTS TO RESISTING BEFORE MUCHUMBER."
Karen Hunter, host of an interview program, tweeted that West was just "being himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I decide NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes, or supporting his art) who I believe is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed, saying it was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, not forgetting the missing music legend, Prince, which changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Charge of attempted execution by stabling in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear on Monday at the Belfast Trial Court.
Prosecutor's office will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Tronos Game Star, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for its role as Jon Nieve in the violent series of medieval fantasy of the HBO, Tronos Game.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the male hero stereotype, saying that those on-screen roles often passed on to young boys who had to be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that "something has gone wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in Tronos Game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that it seems "a big enough" to address this issue.
"Personally, it seems to me quite important right now, where have we been wrong with masculinity?" he commented.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems now seen?"
Kit believes that television can have some of the responsibility for growing toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, which makes young people feel that they have to be this specific form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequeela or sequel of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that he is "hidden of battle fields and horses".
As of November, Kit will lead True West, Sam Shepard's theatrical work telling the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes that getting to know his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever got from Throne Game.
"I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of the character of Kit, Jon Nieve, in the fantastic series awarded with Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on a farm of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are over 820,000 people in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40 000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, resulting in a change over the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced in practice in its entirety, the Chinese health authorities declared at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100 000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in China's LGTB community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB collective suffers from a lot of discrimination.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are not to use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a member of his staff leaking data from Senators of the Republican Party and asserting that it is "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
Ms. Maxine Waters criticized on Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three U.S. Senators of the Republican Party on Wikipedia's pages on legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that these accusations were driven by commenters and "extreme right" websites.
"Menteries, lies and more vile lies," Waters commented on a Twitter post.
Supposedly, the published information included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person in the Capitol published the information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration was carried out at some point after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of one Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not at all responsible for the filtration of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"Deject this information with anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that it is not the season necessary to be a Member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
He mustn't rebel.
He should not question the accuser's motives.
You must keep calm and calm."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction with the criticisms of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of being too angry during Thursday's appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to break Waters down in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent accusations”.
"We will make sure that the authors are found," he continued, "and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English criticism: Again in action. Rowan Atkinson's spy parody remains short
Now it has become a tradition to search for Brexit piñas in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what it takes to do with this new delivery of the parodic franchise of action and comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic autosatire about how clearly fired we are the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his heels' eyes and inexpressive face, has renewed his license to put his foot in for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comical creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions to overthrow glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a bit of that kind who touched a single note on the topic of Fire Cars that was touched at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious traveling and international man represented by Atkinson years ago in Barclaycard's already forgotten television ads, sowing chaos after him.
In this last delivery, there are one or two good moments.
I loved to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as the propellers hit the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps to the eye, but humor stays rather short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that franchises of "serious" films like 007 and Mission impossible add comical ingredients without problems.
Humor seems more directed to children than to adults and, to me, Johnny English's absurd misconceptions are not as ingenious and correct as Atkinson's silent jokes in Mr. Bean's role.
Now, the repeated current argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated Britain's supersecret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the dismay of the agent on duty, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and crowded character who is watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much margin to work.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as all active spies are at risk, you will have to resort to someone who is withdrawn.
This has to be the Johnny English torpe, who now teaches in a Pijo school, although giving extra-official lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, since it is a spying academy similar to that of Rock School.
English is moved to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his suffering old compinche Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice paper for which Vicki Pepperdine does not take advantage of enough.
Thus, the Batmans and Robin who do things terribly wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a multimillionaire charismatic technology world that claims he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hatred of absurd situations: they dress as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, desatan the chaos hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; moreover, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize itself with the interior of the Volta house.
They were definitely used in full in that last sequence, but, as funny as it may be, the whole still transmits a somewhat childly feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with Johnny English's other films, I could not help but wonder if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the owners of the companies to destinate the savings obtained thanks to the revolution in artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
As the sources point out, the idea would "change" in the party's plans and economic agenda of tilting the country in favour of workers.
This change to a week of four days has received the support of the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a high-ranking Labour Party commented to The Sunday Times: An announcement of a revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"It will not be achieved from one day to another, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter which the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy for the worker, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support these types of ideas, as the Green Party had already promised a four-day work week in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, for the time being, not the whole Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at this time."
The shadowed finance minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to present his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "used" companies that provide public services.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also include the idea that current water companies shareholders do not recover their full participation, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on business management boards and to create inclusive property funds in which 10 % of the shares of private sector enterprises are to be allocated to employees, which would involve annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak in "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigation around Kavanaugh and if I could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed at least one week's final vote for its confirmation as Supreme Court judge and further raises the question of whether the results concluded could influence a Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be held on Sunday, the journalist of "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham talk about whether the FBI could bring to light information that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course, of course," said Kennedy.
"I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that he came out of the allegation and asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He showed himself firm, resolved, weary."
The vote of Graham, however, seems unmovable.
"I already have a decision taken around Brett Kavanaugh and I would overlook the accusation," he said.
"Dra. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she appoints have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star poster is gathered for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will travel to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: ending with extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
If you want to receive a free entry for the event (unless you can pay a VIP entry), the concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", as volunteers, send e-mails to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else that will serve to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
What, though, has Global Citizen achieved at 12 years of age from reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of the so-called "clictivism", which is called to the posture that we adopt when we believe we are doing something really useful by signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in favour of a large number of diverse objectives.
Thanks to these actions, they claim that global leaders announced commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2250 million people in 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments are "The Power of Nutrition", an association of UK-based investors and executives united with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop with all their potential". To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the malnutrition of the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizens' collaborators.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and collaborators of Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of the social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions were undertaken to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
a Global Citizen collaborator replied: "It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights movements have already achieved before and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the performances we will count on at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furnesss and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade on Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretariat
"If necessary," Washington could use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, as published in Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates at the legitimate government's offices, is no more than a pretext for expanding into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe," he said.
Furthermore, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
"The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that maritime roads remain open and, if so, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the "power consumer's voice" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia basically consists of using and replacing fuels," he warned while indicating that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been attempting to boost the export of its natural gas to Europe and to relieve it of its function to Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a Moscow hostage.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is worth $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project responds only for economic reasons and is a more unfair example of competition.
"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Energy last September in Moscow.
The US position has, however, met with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organization leading the industry in Germany, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a great problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a meeting recently held between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will look carefully at the possibility of running for the presidency in 2020, said Senator of Massachusetts.
Senator by Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will consider joining the presidential race after the election in mid-term.
During a meeting at the City Hall of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was under way.
"It is time for women to arrive in Washington to amend our fractured government and finally to have women among the leaders," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting myself as a candidate for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion about President Donald Trump during a meeting at the City Hall and stated that "he was taking the country the wrong way".
"I really worry about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke without cover about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren stated that "it's absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
On Thursday a survey was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that it should be presented for the 2020 elections.
58 per cent of the "possible" voters from Massachusetts stated that the senator should not be presented, according to the survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
However, 32% of respondents supported their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent of support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against it.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for 2020 of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, as reported by the agency Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder in a Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"The situation that is going through my son, for everything that has happened since he returned, is well known to the other families who suffer from the effects of TEPT and other injuries to which our soldiers return," he told the public that he gathered in a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the big taboo nobody wants to talk about, and he commented about his son and other veterans of war that "they return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering whether there really exists such respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all other members of the army, have given to their country."
On Monday he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, who interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of achieving a new asylum policy
18 states and the Columbia District support a judicial appeal to the new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" letter in Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News said.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" that presented in August the U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied his asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gangs.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Migration Appeals Board (BIA) in which undocumented immigrants fleeing from domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine made a statement on Friday stating that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
"According to federal legislation, all applications for asylum must be failed under the particular facts and circumstances of the demand and, instead, this exception violates that principle", it is indicated in the friendly curiae.
The lawyers also stated in the writing that the policy denying entry to immigrants is detrimental to the U.S. economy by claiming that they often become entrepreneurs more often and "response a necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People who leave their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or threats by race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion may seek asylum," said Sessions when this directive was announced on 11 June.
Asylum has never been created as a measure to alleviate all problems, not even all serious problems, faced by people around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of dead in a race increases to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more dangerous.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to console her baby with fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search among the few attached possessions left to them in an effort to recover what is possible for them.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged because of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overrun.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had the back and a broken shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continued and very strong replicas.
He could not help crying when he told us about the violent earthquake he had experienced while he was on the fifth floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to stay safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the collapsed wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propagandistic announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of wanting to join the United States Congress on 6 November, something that China strongly denies.
The accusation that Trump launched on Beijing's attempt to influence U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials indicated to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to push China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their business activities, Beijing and Washington are currently being blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels in imports on both sides.
China's compensatory tariffs applying at the beginning of the trade war were thought to be based on exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of China’s leading exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
According to Branstad wrote in an opinion article at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is intensifying even further that pressure with advertising publications in our free press."
"To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and free press when trying to publish a payment announcement at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few conflicting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that people in China may have on the worrying trajectory that is taking the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the strong pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most relevant newspapers circumvented the offer to publish” his article, although it did not specify what newspaper it was.
Analysts point out that Republicans are moving away from women before the mid-term vote with the Kavanaugh debacle
As there are many renowned Republicans who are closing ranks in favour of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there can be a setback, especially by women, in the forthcoming mid-legislative votes.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have expressed their desire to proceed with the vote.
"It is not possible to go back in this kind of business," said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher stated doubt that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last attempt to stand in favour of the FBI's investigation is sufficient to calm the disgruntled voters in this matter.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered at the Senate gates entered "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to continue with the candidacy of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats emerges from all predictions," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
"People say that the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even greater, especially among the indecisive women in the suburbs and the younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote even if they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which he had all his accusations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that there could be a setback if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This matter has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, NBC News reported.
"It is no longer just a question of the committee's vote or the final vote, even if they sit in the bank in Kavanaugh; it is also a question of how Republicans have handled all this and how they have dealt with it," said the news channel Guy Cecil, director of priorities USA (a group that helps in the election of Democrats).
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who stand on the latter's side.
In a new YouGov survey, it is reported that 41 % of respondents are definitively or probably creating Ford's testimony, while 35% claim to believe in Kavanaugh either definitively or possibly.
In addition, 38 % said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitively lied during his testimony, while 30 % said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of the other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web proposes to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the technology legend. A company that is based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"It has to be now," he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so users can create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, pending task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
Something that is unique in personal online data storage is that the user is the one who fully decides who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and skills so that Solid can reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that bought IBM, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technological developers from around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change will be introduced where all their business models are completely modified from one day to the next.
"We're not gonna ask permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrut that "his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite even being launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew he had been granted the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, their two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made his grandfather deserve to be decorated.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and guns".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with the "greater courage", made the line advance before reaching a cannon with one hand and to bring down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, only a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions he carried out his grandfather were "so great that I could never reach his height, but they were very encouraging."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, which involved the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is manifest when shown such a large backing."
The MMA's followers were awake all night for the Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that he stays awake all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so that in the end they won't let him see the main event.
The San José cartel had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the United Kingdom it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight, United Kingdom viewers were amazed when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised when they had to stay awake until the first hour of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter tracker described the switch to cartoons as "a heavy joke."
"There is a government regulation that regulates the content issued from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communication, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Peppe la pigita", yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were going to modify the program to include British viewers in the next editions.
"When I think about the broadcasting option, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we have usually done. We try to offer more than usual so that the amateurs were happy and we passed.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a winner.
At age 24, he told us he didn't realize until he got to high school that "they weren't all like me."
In the first programme of Desert Island Radio Discs 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that his intention in talking about gay rights was to convey "hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made it start to diminish the importance of winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months for illness.
In Laverne's first program, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "lower" to the rest during his childhood, because "you weren't socially accepted that you liked boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and the strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he did not disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year's Commonwealth Games held in Australia to claim that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to convey that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion stated that for him it was also a surprise to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year to the winner of an Oscar, who has been 20 years, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you've lived so much since you were so young" (it was at your first 14-year-old Olympic Games and your father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone the same age as you have been through the same high and low.
The couple had a son in June who they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, no doubt, Robbie."
His son is called his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had the passes to London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I wasn't able to tell you that I wasn't going to be able to be in the front row," he said.
"He had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn't that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that this was what my whole life had dreamed of: competing in the pool in front of me at some Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud of Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He still had chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, remained in the bench on the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Miccelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his way if he wants to avoid becoming a sad hit.
Mickelson, who played at the event every two years to get a record for the 12th time, was discharged by Captain Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to conform to cheering in a few moments and, in others, try to perfect his game in the field and thus be able to correct what afflicts him.
Never the directest driver, not even at the highest time in his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National field, where the long rush punishes continuously with wrong blows.
And, if the camp is no longer disappointing enough, Micchelson, in the ninth game of Sunday, faces the brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games that have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below at the start of the 12 individual matches, began in an impressive way, the Miccelson party could have been decisive.
Furyk showed trust in his partner, he could not say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he had today, he slapped me in the back, and surrounded me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I thought they would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we think it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's brand of more played games of the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of an entire Ryder Cups trajectory that had never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 cattle, 20 lost and 7 equal, although Furyk said his presence contributed many more intangible values to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to make fun of others; it's great to have it on the team," he explained.
"I think younger players have been happy to have it as a support, too this week; it was fun.
It adds a lot more than just game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you come in with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 Valderrama match, where a band led by Seven Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to end the others by climbing their heels for a minimum margin, winning 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop to remember that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and won it, but for very little time," Bjorn said, portrayed, after watching the generation of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story will teach me and everyone that team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no less or less, than the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players have done in a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to move forward.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, you test all your ability as a golfer.
That is the message to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now it's time to put aside your partner, go and get the best out of yourself."
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as couples, being the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends in the last few days of these major tournaments and has been part of the team he won in Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super-important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel like we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main party, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole tour," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but will not be done until at least the next year due to defective systems and the progressive increase of costs, reported the local media.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the boat that heads the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper some statements from a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery bothered the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar signals, infrared and very small acoustics.
Among other important features are longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project their power in overseas) to be outdated when they start serving, Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate frigate F125 held headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if it was sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the personnel in the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other ships of similar class that Germans used in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also presented a problem.
It is believed that it has reached 31 billion € ($3600 million), instead of the initial €22 billion.
The problems facing the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of the naval power of Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy is "no ships able to deploy."
The officer said that the problem has worsened over time, because the old boats were discharged, but they have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spyes on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, attempts to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and to help guide the next conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common bats and sopranos, as well as the river bats of Daubenton and long ear browns of the Invewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds gathered in the recordings to discover the frequency of bat calls and what species do.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed image of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of prairies and how forests for bats and other associated species should be maintained.
The bat stocks in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electric wiring can also pose a risk to them, as well as insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the subject of bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who are engaged in regular surveys, nest inspections and, at times, rescues.
The organization has opened even the first and only reserve dedicated to Scottish bats in the state of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The director of the estate, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the proper habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, as it can be unintentionally destroyed a breeding colony and 400 females could be killed, which would mean an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said, "We still have much to learn about bats and many other species about which we do not know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has catalogued allegations of rape as "fake news", and says people "want to know" at the cost of his name.
His lawyers have received instructions to denounce the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were issued.
In front of Portugal and Juventus he was accused of violating an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He was accused of paying him $375,000 to hide the incident, according to Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, 33-year-old Ronaldo tached the story as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the winner of the Golden Ball five times looking at the camera.
"They only want advertising at the cost of my name.
It's the same story as always.
They want to be famous for just mentioning me, but that's the way I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing an appeal to Der Spiegel for the accusations that appear in what they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy," Reuters reports.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player will try to get compensation for "moral damage by a amount corresponding to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
It appears that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her annually, according to the documents recorded at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga declared that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him that it was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had cheated on that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but was consented.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because he had "terror of reprisals" and was concerned "to be humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to cancel the agreement, since she was still traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has changed to Juve, a large Italian football for a contract of €100 million.
Brexit: The UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent all life" if it lost its position as a world leader in automobile manufacturing after Brexit, said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worried" that Toyota UK would inform the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production would temporarily be stopped at its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of the delays on the customs in the case of an unagreed Brexit could lead to loss of work.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that, if Britain breaks up with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have shown their fears about leaving the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he will close his Mini plant at Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are about the problems that could arise in the assembly chains in the case of an unagreed Brexit.
The Toyota production line is based on the adjusted production mode (‘just in time’ or at the last moment’), where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU to manufacture cars per charge.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there could be an interruption at the border which, according to the sector, could result in delays and the depletion of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to accommodate the amount of material equivalent to more than one day's inventory on its Derbyshire plant, said the company and, in that case, the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is "calibrated precisely to avoid these controls at border crossings".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that not only allows us to get out of the passage right now but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence of Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful supply chain set."
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production would stop, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union union on the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover."
One government spokesman said, "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan that limits our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with vice-fiscal general Rod Rosenstein could "rest another week", as the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in Russian elections, links between help from Trump and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Expectation before Trump decides to fire the deputy general or not and thus compromise Mueller's independence has fed Washington's cottages for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the talks he had with Trump with a microphone that he himself was leading to try to disown the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, between news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump (now in the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to prevent a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the vote of the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said, "No date has been defined, it could be this week, or another one could be postponed, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the march and I will inform the press, as I do."
Some journalists would refute that statement: Sanders has not held any press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the shortage of press wheels was not due to an aversion to TV journalists who act with grandiloquence, although he said: "I did not disagree with the fact that they were bragging."
Then she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president carries out more questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, while he quoted without proof: "We have countered those numbers."
Press wheels will continue to be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option to ask directly the president of the United States, I think it's a lot better than making them to me.
We try to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with the dignitaries visiting him.
Press conferences with him only occur on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why he was like this, where he made a bold appearance and, at times weird, to the journalists who were gathered there.
The Secretary of State of Health writes to the EU workers of NHS Scotland about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State of Health has written to the EU staff working in the HHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and their desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of applications for citizenship for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, they have followed the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the way out in which they chose to make the decisions expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible scenario where there would be no agreement.
I know all this must be very disconcerting for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Professionals across the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of health service, which benefits the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to keep counting on you."
Christion Abercrombie is being operated urgently after a head wound
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player was surgically intervened in an emergency after having a head wound last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, said the Tennessee Organ.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed informed journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"I came to the band and it collapsed right there," Reed said.
Both trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing it on a camel and carrying it to be examined in depth.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the camp, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher farm tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be subject to a higher farm tax when they buy property in the United Kingdom and the extra money collected by this measure will be used to provide shelter to "without ceiling" according to the new conservative plans
Change will neutralize the success reaped by Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the tax on farm income will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasurery expects to raise up to £120 million a year for the "without ceiling"
The additional money raised by the increase in the tax on the transmission of farms to foreign property buyers in the United Kingdom will be used for "without ceiling" aid today announced Theresa May.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with its promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and bullying those with higher incomes.
The increase in the tax on farm income will be charged to non-tax persons and companies in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to encourage government policy to combat begging in the streets.
The charge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, also including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the buy-to-let system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasurery expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London's new construction properties are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to have access to affordable housing.
Many of the most wealthy areas in the country (particularly in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction in transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
She accused large builders of keeping high prices on property when buying avidly land without intending to use it and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas applicable to affordable housing to solve the "harrowing housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of evictions without cause.
It also proposes to grant the most powerful local authorities to build new housing.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my office as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life of each new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to direct Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says that his "primary goal" is to become a Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotch is excited at the possibility of revitalizing the club in the north-east, which currently occupies the third position in the League One (the third league division in England), three points from the first.
He spent the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B hat," said Ross in Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a child and it's something he's always made him want to come back.
That opportunity will only become reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's leader include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he went to such a large club name after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals.
"At this moment, the success for me is measured according to whether I can return this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it should be."
Ross has only been practicing as a coach for three years, after being a assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts technical body.
Later, he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren turn from being on the edge of the descent to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"Probably it was a real crossroads," he recalled in reference to when the Alloa was taken over.
"I always thought management was the best thing I was going, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, because it was good, I could make a very good living with it and enjoy some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from stress and pressure from that work; however, in the direction I feel fine.
I always wanted to train and now I've managed to do it, it's the time of my adult life in which I've felt better, without a doubt."

According to a survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has boosted profits in British pubs who struggle to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The groups of pubs and bars saw how their sales increased by 2.7% in July, while the profits of the restaurants dropped by 4.8%, as the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Business Consultancy, who collected the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England still remains in the World have still made the pattern of the previous month in July, in which the pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, although the restaurants have fallen even more.
The fall of 1,8% in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly serve drinks had their strongest month, in front of most restaurants, in which the profits were reduced.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered with heat, although not as drastic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the managed bars and pubs, the sales of drinks rose to 6.6% during the month, while the meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, of the hospitality and leisure analysts at SSR, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in the out-of-home business market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still struggling, although the drop of 4.8% in sales compared to last year is going to be especially painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for gastronomy operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in UK restaurants, bars and pubs, the performance data of 47 operating groups are collected and analysed, with a combined billing of over £9 billion and is the market reference value.
One out of five children has secret social media accounts behind their parents
One out of five children (some 11 years of age) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, according to a survey
The survey, conducted to 20,000 high school students, revealed growth on the fake Instagram pages
News has exacerbated fears that sexual content will be published
20% of students claimed to have a "primary" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years of age) create accounts on social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a photo-sharing reference site.
News has exacerbated fears that sexual content will be published.
About 20% of students said they had a "primary" healthy account that they showed their parents, while they had other privates.
A mother who happened to meet her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violate me."
The research, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent colleges, found that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" in the Scottish athletic federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to form part of the Scottish athletic federation directive as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning track and field athlete in Scotland and his president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want sport to benefit from its great international experience in the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletic community of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, and we are sure that athleticism in Scotland will benefit greatly by having it in its directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I like to be an athlete's spokesman and I hope to be able to bring things and help develop the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert at the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or how much would I do.
It has been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the banishment comparing mothers with cows divides to opinion on the Internet
An Internet public opinion company has been divided into an ad that compares to mothers who breast-feed with cows to whom they order.
To mark the launch of what is theoretically the "first silent snacks of the world", the technology company for the consumer Elvie published an announcement inspired by a video with some ironic music showing mothers telling the freedom that the new milk extractor gives them.
Four real women dance in a barn full of hay in dance floor mode, along with some cows, with letters like, "Yes, I sort myself alone, but I don't have tail" and "If you haven't noticed it, they're not boobs, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Order them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, I'm ordering my women."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has created a great controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the "meals" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to announce this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before they give birth in order to produce milk, except that they take away their babies days after birth," wrote one person.
The Elvie milk extractor is quietly adapted to a lactation suppressor (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Treumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "Let's make a more reckless announcement."
However, other people defended the announcement, as a woman who admitted that the song was "deternillant".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still breast-feed, I'm sure I'd have one.
By using the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little accommodated, but I don't give it any more turns.
It's a great product," a woman told us.
Another person told us: "It's a funny announcement to mothers who use a lactating bomb (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
In the announcement, there is neither praise nor judgment of the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the subjects.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who milk with the pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and it is quietly attached inside the lactation controller, which makes its users able to move, subject to their babies and even go out on the street with the bomb in operation.
Mother's partner Ana Balarin and ECD comments: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it was worth a daring and provocative launch.
Showing parallelism between expressive women and milk cows, we intended to draw attention to the use of lactating bombs and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and close manner the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new bomb.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb appears on the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded along the gateway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of discreetly displaced minors to a camp at the Texas border
The number of minors detained has experienced a considerable increase, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has practically remained at the usual levels, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration, which are making it difficult to equip these children.
Traditionally, most of the godfathers, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that a proposal to accommodate a child would endanger their own home in the country.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential fathers and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with governmental immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high office of the Immigration and Customs Office, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who asked to support unaccompanied minors.
The agency confirmed after 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of the sponsors or their relatives are illegally in the country, and most of them are criminal immigrants.
So we keep chasing these people," Albence said.
In their efforts to prosecute minors more quickly, staff members have introduced new rules requiring that some of them be brought before the court within a maximum of one month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers of the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to defend their legal status to a judge for immigration matters.
Those who are not considered suitable for the shelter will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers in the reception centres and the reports of the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent seizures or attempts to escape.
According to the defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of their size, signs of discomfort in these children are overlooked.
Moreover, moving to camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could lead to a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "forces of occupation" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the theme "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting in this sacred battle until we spread all Syrian territories" both of terrorist groups and of "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces of Syria opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 ground soldiers in this country devastated by war.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that adequate conditions were provided for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "seeming irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone on the last important rebel bason of Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had some "clear spots" and expressed the hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including the combatants of the Nusra Front (connected to Al-Qaeda), who will "be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy from the United Nations, hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and advised against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Command
According to that logic, Trump would win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators will surely expect, a removal or a scandal will prematurely end his presidency.
This would certainly be "The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment, no signs of fatigue are seen in viewers.
Since 2014, the maximum hourly attendance rates have doubled to $1.05 million for CNN and have nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at maximum time, compared to the 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed cable channel indexes with 3.5 million viewers for major night news programs.
"It's a strange attraction that we still can't understand," says Neal Baer, producer of "Designified Survival," a dramatic series of ABC on a cabinet secretary who became president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip he made in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him I'd vote for Trump.
Why, she asked him.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the answer Scovell received.
The chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families could meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can be allowed.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you have been watching an expert panel for six hours discussing the use of the "deep background" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather hunter ("a worn-out pride garment", in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s shocking descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"By offering something new every night, it's in part what makes everything look like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," when he talks to us about the alternating distribution of Trump's show and his daily spins of the plot (either going into a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, he was a sunny day of 27 degrees on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not take off the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging a thread.
"I remember when in those days we were doing all those crazy programs and people told us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss comments.
"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right."

Foreign money flows into the most adjusted middle-term elections of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising the influx of money that is coming to the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a Congress district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburg, whose structure is recently redesigned, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that is largely overlapped with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a financing contest for campaigns between the major financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (NCDC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support to China, even though after it left behind
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a pleasant meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners drove away the Trump Organization's management team.
The officials of the State Department decided to return the heads of the US diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "new decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department spokesman, in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to punish El Salvador, who had already received help from around 140 million US dollars 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that their intention was for the conference to continue, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is planning to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, if the diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment by Washington.
A spokesperson from the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with internal deliberations under the status of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under anonymity.
The Study of History
The next planned step could be the report by special lawyer Robert Mueller on possible obstruction to Trump's justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public registry.
Mueller is also thought to be investigating the possibility that Trump's campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will see himself accountable to that camera, just as he prepares to re-present himself to the voters, and perhaps finally to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionals, and with this I do not suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the contest.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to give a coup against Hitler. It was only necessary that the West would resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of butchery that followed.
The course of history revolves around these inflection points, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or delays.
The Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump fires Vice President Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's research fate?
Rosenstein has been in good condition since this newspaper reported that last year she had secretly suggested recording to the president and speculated about her inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his office in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote for a Congress in mid-term elections that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will meet with a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the meeting against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive tie in Spain against the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify in the G Group of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from achieving his first appearance of the season up to the 2 to 2 draw against the Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a trampoline for bigger things.
"We managed to make a good point, as Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We started the party by believing that we could get something and go out with a point.
Perhaps we could have won the victory at the end, but overall, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out for all and we went the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope that we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult party because they have already achieved a good result in the previous party, but with the whole public supporting us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we see a general atmosphere that everything will go well.
The team's fine, the guys are enjoying themselves very much and we're having a good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave the season behind and achieve success."
Fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose sleep
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted them to be cared for, few people talk about this with their relatives.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about this.
"People want to take care of them as a family member, but they're not taking the steps to have this conversation," Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance company, tells us.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a determining factor in the cost.
It incorporates in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a valuable hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or make sure of yourself with your own savings, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: advance to legal battles.
Get a medical attention power to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with their own wishes if they cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a notary power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on his behalf and ensure that his invoices are paid if he is incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: imagine your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan to always be ready.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake: what do doctors have to deal with?" asked Martin.
"What are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to have everything planned."
Shoot a man with a car at Ilfracombe several times
They fired a man with a car while he was walking home after going out at night.
The victim, a man about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and the police have appealed to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, the authorities said, the number of deaths is expected to increase.
With the blocked communications, assistance officials have not been able to obtain any information from the Domanga Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Domanga is a regency that extends over more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck west of Dongala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries and took the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatal victims on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 devastated southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that affected the south coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of peoples and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pdie Jaya's reign in Aceh, causing destruction and panic in recalling the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunamis, but the collapse of buildings resulted in the death of over 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large earthquakes that caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.

Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29-year-old and Wasilla citizen, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report published by the State police in Alaska on Saturday.
According to that police report, when a well-known woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she took off her phone.
Palin has been sentenced to pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held with an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He presented himself to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "definitely innocent" when his statement was requested, the chain reported.
Palin is facing three minor Class A offences, which means that he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a minor offence of Class B, with one day ' s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges are filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of interfering with the denunciation of a domestic violence crime and of having a gun in a state of drunkenness, in relation to the incident.
Her girlfriend had said she gave her a fist on her face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her child's violent behavior with the post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of fatal victims
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude earthquake of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, located north-east of Yakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that circulate on social media and show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a player festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out last October an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway of Lower Manhattan, bringing down the pedestrians and cyclists who were on their way.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intensely" and caused "intensibly" serious bodily injuries, in accordance with the notice of the intention of a death penalty application, submitted in the South District of New York.
The two charges entail a possible death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 charges involving eight murder charges with the help of organized crime, often using federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to prosecutors, which described the way Saipov carried out it as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", is specified in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District in New York last processed a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were sentenced by conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse over the days and months after the attack, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be cast in his hospital room, the police said.
He has been found not guilty of the indictment of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense lawyers representing Saipov, said that they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a sentence of guilt with life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously requested prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Mr Tory said that NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's deputies suggested that he should handle negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at Birmingham concentration that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" if Farage had been Brexit's Secretary.
But the challenge that Prime Minister May faces to reconcile his divided ranks has highlighted even more when a Tories group in favour of permanence have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep up the plan of the commitment signed in Chequers in the midst of the attacks on the supporters of Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
Member Bone said in Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd have gone out already," he said.
This Member of Parliament by Wellingborough added: "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be serene.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and we want to remain in the European Union is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in the concentration, where she told the reporters: "I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote in favour and is not popular between our party and our activists, who are actually going out on the streets and voting in the first place.
Forget about Checkers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: The prime ministers keep their positions when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the concentrateds that they would have to make politicians "feel the heat" if they saw they were going to betray the decision taken in the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We're going to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we'll never rest until we've become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, supporters of the permanence traveled the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists waved banners from Tories Against Brexit after the group presentation this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus, for the border in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all possibilities for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she "will consider all the possibilities of presenting herself for the presidency" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a usual critique of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren would face Trump by 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him whether he was planning to present himself for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes that there is a woman at the highest."
A man arrested for the murder with the LSU Sims player's gun
Baton Rouge (Luisiana) police announced this Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for killing Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson's 20-year-old arrest at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man who sees himself in the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot near the Southern University campus at the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a headshot wound that finally caused his death," said Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and got a Simpson shot.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having been at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the police department of East Baton Rouge Parish.
Sims, a player originally from Baton Rouge of 1.98 meters tall, played in 32 matches last season, being held in 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team orders will give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas was ranked before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton in the forgetfulness of defending his position on the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into boxing and let Hamilton run into the queue of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went out hard a turn later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after an action with the almost footprints that made the Ferrari pilot have to let the inside loose at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself on the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old that day, began from the last row of the grill and was placed in the seventh square at the end of the first round.
Then he led a large part of the race while clinging to his tires to achieve a quick finish and overcome Kimi Raikkonen for fourth position.
Finally, he went into boxing on the round 44, but could not increase his pace on the remaining eight laps by recovering Raikkonen fourth position.
It's been a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman letting me through.
The team has done exceptional work to get a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on a rally on Saturday for his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused of sexual assault on Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court.
Speaking in a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are "sick, disgusting and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false," he said.
"When you read the publications and the filtrations, and then they say "But if I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't filter it," she added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the accusations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration would come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the committee, as The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep him confidential, and so I did."
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who during the Saturday night rally said: "I'll tell you one thing: that's a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defence to the appointment of the Supreme Court, who had been accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and repugnance, you don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president as Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against the Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday in Elite League before Belfast Giants by winning the game back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial advantage of two goals thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local tie before Dwyer restored the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard equaled for the Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secure their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had just won the Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, of which the Giants won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford provided assistance to make Beauvillier double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan re-placed the local team with a desire to play in the minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to match the match in the minute 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first part.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched the match with a throat in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran were combined to help Nielsen give Dundee leadership for the first time in the party at the end of the second party and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as the end approached.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
A air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large-scale earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to hit the area and many are trapped among the debris in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grande refused to leave his post in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport. This tower was being hit by a strong swing.
He remained firm to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the track at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian channel ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when you hear this," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency claims that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many corpses under the ruins and many people have not been contacted," says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the agency.
Waves that reached up to six metres have devastated Palu, which will hold a massive burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors as much as possible, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the air accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and the crew had evacuated safely the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon you could not notice a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came too low.
"That's something extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes notes that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that began to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were doing nearby improvements to a dock also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sinks about 30 metres (100 feet) under the water.
Data from the aviation security network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the timing of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution finished presenting its arguments on Saturday in a new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used mobile phone records to chain Quinton Tellis' movements, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with that of Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "minding, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Telllis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they only met a week before.
Rowlett said that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The defense has scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held by the jury that very day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A threesome hip hop wants to fill your music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop was removed from its origins from political messages and from addressing social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Interpreters such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York girl asks a couple to fire her after a "racist" text
A New York child girl is going to sue a partner for discriminatory dismissal after she has received a wrong text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denies being racist and compares the demand with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his dismay to discover that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when he arrived at his first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER NEGRA PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing his foot-meek, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice claiming that his former Afro-American babysitter had done a terrible job and that instead he was waiting for a Filipino, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for one day's work and sent her home to Uber.
Maurice is now demanding the couple for a redundancies compensation with the intention of receiving a compensation of $350 per day for the six-month internal work position for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show you that things don't go that way," she told The Post on Friday and added that "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the claims that they were racists saying that the end of Maurice's employment was more reasonable, as they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife had sent him something I didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the demand as a "extortion", Pasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months before and that he was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to go for someone that way?
That is not a very decent thing," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behaviour and their logic.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveal a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was difficult to put herself in the place of someone who read it for the first time before her publication.
It's really nice to know what we know about Paddington's great success now."
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before inspired himself on a toy to write the book for children, hoped that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something "agrid" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to brag," he said.
"But as Paddington had been as real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who accomplishes something important: you are proud of him, even though it is not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to his own Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye by phone
Upon landing, his daughter was taken urgently to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save his life.
"Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that it was not expected to succeed," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"After I received Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep the pumping of his heart slowly exhausted and left his system.
She had died before time and everything was turning off.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I could not scream, nor cry, because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the other passengers on the plane, apart from the terrible experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"I hid my head and tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicides is a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any fathers to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, age 45 and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up anywhere."
However, he left work before he died, as he was "in a truly dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm continually concerned that it can have repercussions."
Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can come to and with whom you can talk, even if he is a friend.
You don't feel silent, you have to talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after the death of her mother.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or anything like that," he tells us.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
The Christmas Day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn't even look at them."
He said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: "Leave a void in the whole family.
He's left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on a thread at the time the FBI starts the investigation.
"I thought if we could actually get something like what I was asking for (a limited investigation in time, limited in scope), maybe we could bring a bit of unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that I was afraid the committee would be "getting a pique" in the midst of a partisan paralysis.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
Its refusal is entirely due to chronology.
Only five weeks are left for the mid-term elections on 6 November. If, as expected, Republicans have bad results, their attempts to achieve the choice of the man they want for the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of North Korea deserters "fall" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of South Unification, said that last year there were 1,127 desertions, compared to 2,706 2011.
Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high rates charged by human traffickers have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments about it.
The vast majority of the deserters in the north are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China believes that deserters are illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Early in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This took place after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which generally agreed to work on a Korean nuclear-weapon-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress.
"Without U.S. trust, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances we will in no way be the first to unilaterally disarm us," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House of Representatives minority, said the appointed Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a "historical" and was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Austin (Texas).
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said it's hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave on Thursday to the Senate's Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh was thrilled to deny the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost screaming and choking while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats , calling the accusations against them of "growth defamation and clearly coordinated" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections of 2016.
Pelosi said that in his view Kavanaugh's testimony proved that this could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed his bias against the Democrats.
"I believe that he disqualifies himself with these statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
He then objected when he was asked whether he would challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in office and the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling Congress or FBI the truth, you won't be able not only to be in the Supreme Court, you won't even be in court where you're exercising now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Circuit Appeals Tribunal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible judgments against the Law on Accessible Health Care or the Roe Case against Wade, since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and wait for us to think it's all right," Pelosi said.
And women have to push him.
It's a just-justified diet, it's months and years of rage overflowing, and she can't let it go without crying.
"We cried when we got angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, do I?"
He continued to talk: "A woman who was an executive in some company helped me a lot and told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique for which when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
No, I'm angry."
And then I followed what I was doing.
I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because basically they are not understood well.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first works, in an office dominated by men, was once I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. A grown woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the cockroach and dragged me to a ladder.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he said.
"You have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've backed you up."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital adventure on board a boat called Monkey Business, which had to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, was found to have no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would appear for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-premeditated decision," he told me in laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Blancanieves and the seven dwarfs."
As the campaign was already well advanced, it stayed behind in fund-raising, so it was promised that it would not go back into the race unless it had raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters were giving the men $1,000, giving her only $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was so overcome by emotions (gratitude for the people who supported him, frustration for a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on the gathering of voters instead of delegates, and angered at sexism), that he was caught up.
"The logic would have been to think that he had had a nervous crisis," said Schroeder recalling the reaction of the press.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you gonna put on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first rescues of trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still much left to finish the battle, a break between countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, launched the first warning early in the year by putting tariffs on the main Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150,000 million) in products, which carries taxes half of the products entering the United States from China.
Beijing has, on all occasions, taken equivalent reprisals, recently applying five to ten percent tariffs to US products worth $60 billion.
China is committed to equalizing US attacks, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will sink soon.
Getting Washington back would mean yielding to demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. trade war pressures could positively help China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can make it possible to start a crash of the economy in either of the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than the viewers have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on Asian issues for the strategic cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, said the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that has already been fought for over seven years.
In a speech earlier by the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the conditions of the country were improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure thanks to the progress achieved in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods had already been met.
The UN estimates that, since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country and needing humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem recognized that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted insurgency.
Europe is done with Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, off the outskirts of Paris (France).
The United States has now carried six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14,5 points necessary to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Miccelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water in the 16 par 3 hole, thereby admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell defeated by 5 and 4 to the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
Player number one in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 in English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already carries eight Ryder Cups, became the European with more tournament victories of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I can't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very hard year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm very, very happy that I could get the drink back.
It's an achievement of the whole team and I'm so glad I could have helped," said an excited García after the European team's victory.
Now he passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who has already defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in an individual party on Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride in having defeated Tiger Woods, as I grew up seeing this man," said the 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, just standing behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we're losing him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
You're a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Committee of the Ryder Cup, and we will move on.
I want these 12 guys a lot and I'm proud to be your captain.
Now it's our turn to lean our head.
They've overcome us."
Red tide upgrade: Decrease concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota

Red tide has also been detected in Pasco County.
During the past week, average concentrations have been reported in Pinellas County and its coast, concentrations between low and high on the coast of Hillsborough County, concentrations of background to high in Manatee County, concentrations of background to high in Sarasota County and its coast, concentrations of background to middle in Charlotte County, concentrations of background to high in Lee County and at its coast, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation problems are still reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
