Cumulative rapid progressive incidence of coronary artery disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/ European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary artery disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although in a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare more for an outbreak of patients with VOCID-19 who will need care and, especially, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a portion of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causing agent as a new coronary artery, now referred to as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronary artery disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COPID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, i.e., an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union country/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compared them with those of Hubei Province in China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom to Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of CVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The issue of 5 March of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, in accordance with the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy only.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 cases
At the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of CVID-19 in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated daily at 8 a.m.
These data were used to evaluate the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom, and to compare them with those of Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account, therefore, the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases notified from each country until 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. and compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The trends in the cumulative cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of CVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom in general followed those in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and increased significantly, then around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar increases in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It should be noted that, until 15 March at 8 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy for 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of CVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This occurs despite countries being in different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that should be tested for confirmation of CVID-19, including testing for updating.
In early March 2020, physicians in affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with CVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive treatment units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization for COPID-19 cases in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 people between 2010 and 2011.
Modelled scenarios related to saturation of health system capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the United Kingdom of prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk greater than 90% of intensively treated beds capacity, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment on CVID-19.
Given that the cases have so far concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive treatment units generally meet a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and intensive treatment beds should be made available preferably in the Land Unit Nomenclature for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's example and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly moving forward in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare for a sustainable community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical assistance, especially intensive treatment, such as in affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their actions properly, if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to intensify their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure in the health system.
If these initiatives fail, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronary artery disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by coronary artery disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a disaster for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, VOCID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide an ongoing and comprehensive evaluation of the research object, which develops rapidly.
We will address the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help to understand and eradicate this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to be confined to the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronovirus (CoV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its disease was called CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
Until March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients killed.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the " public enemy number one", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles were published on CVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequencing of the isolated virus of several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as the other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have found twice highly pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which cause an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current VOCID-19 is the third epidemic of VOC in the documented history of human beings.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1.1, a portion of pneumonia cases with unknown origins was initially reported to the National Health Commission of China in Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the Sequencing of the CoV was published.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the contagion of health professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission among people was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that 41 patients with only 21 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Sea Fruit Market, which was considered the location of the beginning of the contagion by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
Until this report, the disease has spread across China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation gets worse rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the epidemic still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centers with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, especially in the age range of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, some were under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in groups, especially in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The basic number of reproductions (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people grew exponentially before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the mass transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (older than 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and encapsulated viruses that contain a single RNA chain with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alfacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect humans.
The glycoprotein spike (S) of the envelope joins its cell receptors of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) and dipeptidel peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively and, consequently, membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released in cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA is accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsidide proteins vesicularly containing vesicles, which join the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% of genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original location of the outbreak, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market, in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, the particles of SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in ultrafine sections of the human airway epithelium.
It was found that the human ECA2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human protein ECA2 in a weaker way than the protein of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the ORF8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020 Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of the human ECA2 of total length to the resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can unite two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening medicines to suppress infection with SARS-CoV-2.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs of bats similar to SARS called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the barriers of species and infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes transport the virus from bats to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, long-term seal mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on 99% genetic homology between a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a great difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence are being expected (Fig.33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with moisture from 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to the heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorexidine, are efficient in the deactivation of the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study was reported in relation to the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only consult previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host by means of standard recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptor (TLR), NOD-type receptor (NLR) and RIG-I-type receiver (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophages phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus infected cells.
Collaborative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing apoptosis of T cells.
Humor immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of free local radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure, and even death.
The infection with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by the onset of symptoms in a group of people, affects the elderly more with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a greater chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and, most of the time, 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on demography of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that the health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to other people.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to or infected by the virus usually need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which may come alone or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, lack of air, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, coral, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the symptoms of the disease appeared.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in the lung imaging diagnosis, should go through screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family grouping and a grouping with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that the patients of MRS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of the patients needed ventilatory support, much more than the patients of COVID-19, which consists of the higher mortality of SORS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with SERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and throat pain (13% to 25%) were shown to be the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2%, when the confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Comparatively, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic R0 reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV varied from 2 to 4, only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with respect to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, like a cruise ship.
Patients generally present travel or residence history in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with individuals or patients infected in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it was reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and patients who received discharge from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm to prolong the quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral blood white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cells count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count less than 1 x 109/L, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Enzymes and myoglobin levels in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer-D level, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count presented a progressive reduction.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are present in most patients with COVID-19, and have bilateral irregular shadows or opacity in dark glass in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ASD).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of fluids and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the exchange of gases.
The dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most severe results of chest X-ray usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of the COVID-19 demonstrated the discamation of pneumonia, the formation of the hyalin membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as a primary criterion for the diagnosis of CVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for the diagnosis (which was not only derived from RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and essential to an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol to use the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 20 x 10-18 mol/L at 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre of input) using a measuring rod in less than one hour, without the need for complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians can provide, at the best of their capacity, palliative treatment for patients at COVID-19, at the same time as they try a variety of therapies that were used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Up to the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OCMO), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technique used to treat severe heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organs functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine cascade results from the exacerbated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ADDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in serious patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include modulation of the immune response directed to T cells; blocking of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokines 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the prognosis.
However, short treatment periods with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses were recommended for careful use in patients with severe COVID-19 patients.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy was confirmed.
However, it was found that intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally intended for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola virus and Marburg.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple tape RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being very awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, damage to the liver and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma for cured patients and antibody generation
The blood collection of patients who have been cured from a contagious disease to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from disease contraction has a long history.
In fact, patients who have been cured usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who were cured from the COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in severe condition.
His symptoms improved in 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the large-scale method before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be considered cautiously.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and plasma demand is large to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat an epidemic of global proportions.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and to identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or make a screening for effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, MTC, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the TCM theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or are vague, since it is difficult to extract and check these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for CVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it has been found that capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen are effective in the treatment of CVID-19.
The best cure rates of patients with CVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China who used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, who used TCM in only about 30% of patients with CVID-19, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and working colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the times necessary for the recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were considerably lower in the group treated by western medicine and TCM than only in the group treated by western medicine.
The rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by western medicine and TCM than for the group treated only by western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by western medicine and TCM than in the group treated only by western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still await more duly controlled tests in larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of the TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with VOCID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel great fear of the highly contagious disease that can be fatal, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric diseases, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychosis, delusional symptoms and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
Contact tracking and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health system's actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of the contagion, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with CVID-19, to people suspected of the disease and to people who had contact with them, as well as to the general population, who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 and on treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to stop the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and people infected to susceptible hosts, and are usually complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate potent and lasting neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before the start of a clinical study.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions, due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MRS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months, on average) required for the development of a vaccine and variations in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, in the same way that SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a predictive model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
VOCID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment had greater chances of having underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive treatment (mean age of 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of patients with CVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with CVID-19 who need intensive treatment are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to positive ECA2 colangiocytes, which can lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COPID-19.
It is important to note that the underlying age and disease have a strong correlation and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and was proposed as a potential prognostic factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the CRP level with the severity and prognosis of the COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help in predicting the result.
These enzymes are expressly present in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues for predicting outcome/complications of CVID-19.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressives normally used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dose and for a short period in patients with CVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the COPID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and testify to the death of loved members of the family and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than the characteristics of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms at the initial phase of infection (or causes only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the initial phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current epidemic of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Great efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continuous quarantine of almost all the population, in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends until March, and the phase of deceleration lasts between 3 and 4 months.
In the meantime, other specialists are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., considered that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and middle cornet rubble of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new virus identified may become a cyclical episode similar to the influenza.
However, promising signs occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with quarantine and rigid isolation, the disease was kept under control, finally.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker as to its infectivity and, at some point, becomes a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
A comparison of the COPID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough and spiral and possibly by direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus was also found in faeces, which generates a new possibility: that of oral-fetal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, work colleagues and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 breath masks (series no. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid droplets of a potentially infected individual from being transported in the air or adhered to the surfaces of the objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only the N95 masks (series no. 1860s) protect against inhalation of verions of 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the verions being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and both have approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health professionals in direct contact with patients should use the N95 masks (series no. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, health professionals should use isolation dressings to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was using a N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health professionals should also use transparent facial protectors or protective glasses when caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that all wash hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than normal, try to stay at home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
One meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection, as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a great warning to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre reassured the citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of infection and limited reproducivity among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the containment of Wuhan disease on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can benefit from this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must: (1) be more cautious when making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by the citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from hospitals, rather than expect formal reports from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in their initial stage, rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) emit more frequently targeted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and test and improve the response system of society periodically.
The COPID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world, at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a sensation of return from SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the control of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in elderly than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COPID-19 transmit the virus when they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which results in a greater difficulty in containing the spread of CVID-19 than that of SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA trial for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of virus spread.
Given the rapid progress in research on CVID-19, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologist has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs of SARS-like bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates in the bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the bat, let's say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut the transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and causes subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or will it have seasonal recurrence, like flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to seek answers to the above questions and to so many others.
However, regardless of the necessary efforts, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronary artery
The mutation and adaptation boosted the co-volution of coronoviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild disease, as a common cold.
Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed what was thought of the CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an infection with HCoV can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 highlighted the CoVS again and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is very useful.
Most of the HCoVs came from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate storage hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of host animals has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
The investigation of the interactions of the host of the CoV in animals can also provide important information on the pathogenesis of the CoV in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we make comparisons and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic by CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Moreover, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of the virus evolution in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
The coronovirus (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of encapsulated viruses, positive polarity and simple tape RNA.
These viruses that present the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed in an electronic microscope.
As for the structure, the CoVs have unsegregated genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two overlapping open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins.
Polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessory proteins are also encoded by different CoVs strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV gene contains most of the HCVs and is subdivided into four strains (A, B, C and D).
phylogenetic evidence showed that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of rangeCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed the barriers of species, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively higher number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCOV-229E, B814, was isolated from the coriza of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause autolimiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of today and has infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to the confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the epidemic of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent causing the current disease epidemic of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people until 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COPID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
The tracking of the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a structure to understand the natural history, the driving force and the restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for reservoir hosts, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the future prevention of viral migration among species.
In this article, we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, the interspecies transmission and the pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parental viruses of HCOVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after the transmission of interest to a new host.
We also reviewed the trend of HCoV evolution, in which the increase in transmissibility is usually accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain of coraz of patients who contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including peru, camundong, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was later adapted for growth in pulmonary cell strains WI-38.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, spir, discomfort and throat pain, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and subsequent serial passage in brains of mice during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection seem similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superspairers", it was estimated that each contaminated person may contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the peak of viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and creatine kinase elevated are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in the number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients need, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including gastrointestinal treatment, liver and kidneys, may also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which may be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of the zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been dedicated to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially found that the virus was prevalent in small children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis symptoms are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he has been identified in the Netherlands, he is scattered around the world.
It was estimated that HCOV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crupe.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis acquired in a Community way, it was reported that HCOV-HKU1 was associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Just as HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four HCoVs acquired in a Community way have adapted well to human beings and are usually less likely to undergo mutation and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has been reported recently as a cause of serious infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to remain continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most cases confirmed by laboratory originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and in Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MRS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar to MRS, among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 cases confirmed by the laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
From half to the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which were known retrospectally to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continued epidemic of infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and also named the COVID-19 disease.
By 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the lethality related to the confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside this city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 seems to be less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus in the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the evolution of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCoVs acquired in a Community way (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during HCoV infection acquired in a Community way, including the presence of non-specific, mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of CVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in HCoVs acquired in a Community way as well as in SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCoVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, in the same way as the other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies if the orofetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can display seasonality, as in cases of HCoVs acquired in a community way.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including their communicable, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after their passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All HCoVs acquired in a Community way that causes mild symptoms have adapted well to human beings.
From another perspective, it can also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop severe diseases of HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCOVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent in order to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize the restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the permanence time of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If adaptation is appropriate, transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Several years ago, the four CoVs acquired in a Community way circulate in human populations, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and highly pathogenic MERS-CoV have not adapted well to human beings, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and take advantage of the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs acquired in a Community way.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as HCoVs acquired in a Community way, at least until now.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs acquired in a community and less pathogenic way than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will fully fit human beings and circulate among us without a storage or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary hosts, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of a HCoV if it hosts a direct relationship ancestor, sharing high homology at nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a storage host houses HCoV continuously and permanently.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or their parenting virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adapt properly to the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate in a transient manner and then transmit it to humans and increase the scale of human infection.
A HCoV may have the infection interrupted if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In that case, the intermediate host becomes the natural storage host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the zero patient of SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent investigations of seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a dog-guaxinim in the markets of live animals were initially identified as carriers of viruses similar to SARS-CoV.
The identification was corroborated indirectly by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the slaughter of all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that the wild masked palm civets or farms without exposure to the markets of live animals were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the masked palm civets could only be the amplifier intermediate host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals on the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals can serve as intermediate hosts amplifiers of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All these animals seem to be hosting SARS-CoV terminals.
The subsequent search by the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a close-relationshiped coV, named CoV HKU3 by Rhinolophus related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese bat-ferrature.
These bats are positive for antiSARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs similar to SARS (SL-CoVs) were also identified in bats, but no CoVs, except for WIV1, can be isolated as live viruses.
It is known that the human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is the receptor of SARS-CoV.
It was demonstrated that WIV1 derived from fecal bat samples uses ECA2 of bats, civets and human beings as a receptor for cell entry.
It is intriguing that the serum of convalescent patients of SARS was able to neutralize WIV1.
Up to now, the WIV1 represents the ancestral relationship closer to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parenting virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate storage hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groups the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of bats and the CoV-HKU5 of bats.
CoV-HKU4 of bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor as dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) for virus entry.
MERS-CoV dependent RNA polymerase sequences are phylogenetically closer to betaCoV counterparts of identified bats in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV was found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 of the bats, share only 87% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate storage host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive to specific neutralization antibodies of MERS-CoV, just like camels from the Middle East in several African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal rubbles of dromedaries, increased evidence that camels serve as the legitimate host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that the symptoms usually mild, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in camels that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmit viruses not only by the respiratory route, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main transmission route of viruses in bats.
However, there are still no answers, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which can be attributed in a plausible way to transmission between people or transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that house MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a RaTG13 bat CoV, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute a parent relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate storage hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless CoVs almost identical to bats are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be configured among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Sea Sea Fruit Attack Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of transmission of animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggested that a group of small threatened mammals of extinction known as pangolins (Javanica Manis) could also house ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new Pangolim CoV genomes share 85% to 92% of homology in nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to the RaTG13, with about 90% identity at nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity in the sequence of amino acids.
In a huge contrast, the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, although they present a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study on patient pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual healing to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolim is one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal hosts.
However, currently, there is no evidence that confirms the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolim due to the difference in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even lower than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolim, betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genomic sequencing homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the BLDs of the betaCoVs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 stems from the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter argument is in favour of the recombination between the betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses was also studied.
phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from CoVs of bats, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
It was reported that a CoV of bats called ARCoV.2 (CoV of Appalachian Ridge) detected in the North American tricolor bat had a direct relationship with the HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposiders/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also a suspicion that camelides are their intermediate hosts.
For further clarity, the current knowledge of the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecific transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species and infected human beings from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
HCoV-229E's history of interspecific transmission is less clear.
AlfaCoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E were discovered.
Among them, there's an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, human beings, but not the alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, human beings have direct contact with the alpacas.
Second, the alfaCoVs of HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alfaCoV of alpacas caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphaCoV of alpacas was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that the alpacas get from human beings the alphaCoV related to HCoV-229E.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to human beings.
As an alternative, while alphaCoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCOV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries for humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from the bats is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, colonies with high density, narrow social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV in dromedaries dates back to decades.
He is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable storage host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a mild disease and sustains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, since its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, is different.
Specifically, the betaCoVs of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 interest of animals to humans need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological niche with bats through the slaughter or coal mines.
Second, the pangolins could be one of the amplifier intermediate hosts, in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had been newly introduced.
Human beings contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is needed.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of host animals, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating the CoVs to cross the barriers of the species.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other simple tape RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the CoVs can be considered "moderated" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of the CoV to new hosts.
The CoVs have exorribonuclease with a review mechanism, the exclusion of which results in excessive mutability and attenuation, or even inability.
It is interesting that the analog nucleotide rendesivir suppresses the replication of the CoV through inhibition of this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase of RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising antiSARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of mutation of the CoVs are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host who maintains contact with human beings.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would rapidly make vaccines and antivirals ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large genome of the RNA in CoVs exerts an extra plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of interspecific co-evolutionary, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of single reading frames and protein functions encoded in relation to the last three inches of the end of the genome.
Thirdly, the CoVs swap models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a host serving as a mixing container, tape exchange occurs frequently during the transcription of the RNA of the CoV.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can be recombined to generate new CoVs.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidences were found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coVs, such as the SL-CoV of bats and batCoV-HKU9.
Host-virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of SARS-CoVs from human beings and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV passes through rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in the DLR of the S protein.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is selected intensely by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the DLR is in amino acids 318o to 510o in the S1 fragment that binds to the human ECA2 as well as its receptacles for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognize the receptors of ECA2 from several animals, including bats, claws, mice and dogs-guaxinins, enabling the transmission of the virus's interest.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral isolates and onions in the DLR, and four of them are located in the receptor binding pattern for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of the civets has K479N and S487T mutations in their DLR, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein unit S implies that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times greater in this connection than between human ECA2 and S protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be useful to determine if any other correctiver may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the S protein.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and silic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCoV-OC43.
They could also respond to the effective adaptation of these CoVs in humans after the interspecies transmission of their hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the interspecial transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence with the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between human beings and the natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp the dependency factors with the host and subvert the host restriction factors for an effective interpecie transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of host-virus interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-tensive screening with range at host dependency genome level and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
Rise of new HCoVs: back to stake zero
The diversity of the CoVs of bats provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also boost the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessories proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to human beings, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but it was found that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic of nucleotide 29 exclusion from SARS-CoVs was found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the alternance of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA dependent RNA polymerase.
The recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most of the nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that epidemic MERS-CoV underwent recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs are recombined with other animal coVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, probably resulting from the relief of the selection pressure exerted on viruses, such as the pressure of the host's immune system.
One example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCOV-229E, due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E-related bats and camels viruses, alphaCoV of alpacas presents a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in the frames.
Finally, but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It is likely that bats are well adapted to the anatomical and physiological CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural extermination cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the inhibitor receptor of natural extermination cells NKG2/CD94, and to the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ERO) generated from high metabolic activity of bats can either suppress the replication of the CoV or affect the revision by exorribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic strains of viruses when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Therefore, it is not by chance that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or cause at most mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate themselves immensely without causing a high immune response from the host.
This document explains the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the overactivation of the immune response and cytokine cascade, where the higher the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was switched off from the replication of the VOC.
The same immune response shutdown strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon's response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it was discovered that betaCoV of bats shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a CoV of bats that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been discovered that the civets and other animals in the markets harbor viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that the pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or the betaCoVs of the pangolins can contribute with genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by accidental or intentionally man.
The CoVs returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of the CoVs in bats and other animals dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in transmission among humans.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in the bat and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between human beings and civets in markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, the pangolins should be removed from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple betaCoVs strains of narrowly related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through the pangolins and other mammals, and the mode of this transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach must be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we have not been able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, the coVs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombinate, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the crisis of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better response plan and preparation should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats present many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of the CoVs and its natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for people to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several puzzle parts of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it is important to discover under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including human beings, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
If it is a bat, a pangolim or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical are identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of VOCID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection of 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide transmits our experience and is a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, the coronovirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and clinical practice; therefore, the diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially referred to as the 2019 conavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is called conavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guide published online at the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He has attracted excellent attention since the publication.
However, it notes that CVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also updated continuously.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in some context.
Our guide now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We wear your meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological historical elements with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to comply with three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or other communities where cases of VOCID-19 were reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms coming from the city of Wuhan and from nearby areas or other communities where cases of VOCID-19 were reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with confirmed cases (greater or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces, such as home, office, classroom etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging diagnostic resources for COVID-19 infection; (3) count of total white blood cells showing normal, decreased or reduced count of lymphocytes in the initial stage of onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR examination for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity compared to the new known coronaviruses; (3) positive for specific IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 on serum examination; or any change in the specific IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or increased title greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We may note that the real-time PCR examination for nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory tract was added to the second and third edition (18 and 22 January 2020, respectively).
The pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth edition (of 27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020, respectively), and the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an ideal detection kit of nucleic acid for rapid diagnosis and of the samples of the respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us of caring for symptomatic and asymptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, since classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we look forward to the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that they verify and obey the latest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guide in good time to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, higher daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 during the day.
This is the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
On yesterday's date, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research of Bangladesh (IDRC) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news, the director of FDICR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two were between 51 and 60 and one were between 41 and 50.
She also said that two of the victims were from Daca.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video release, the Bengali Minister of Road Transport and Obadul Quader Bridges said that public transport would be paralyzed longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
This paralysis of public transport began on March 26, and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on 8 March, in two people who returned from Italy and also in one of them's wives.
On March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections in the world
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infections by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the world passed from one million, indicated the data of Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronovirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea stated that, until Thursday, it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronary-virus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in 24 hours before 10 hours at Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the US caused by coronovirus infections on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until May 1st.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without coming to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency in 15 days. The vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended for the whole day the duration of its pick-up in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 15 to 6 hours.
Thailand plans to implement pick-up tap from 22h to 4h
Ohio's governor, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1st.
Stores in Australia reduce limits of toilet paper by transaction
On Saturday night and Sunday, Australian Woolworths and Coles stores networks reduced the restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper, respectively, to two packages and a transaction package in all the country's stores.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a package limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Because of the fear of COVID-19, buyers were supposedly stocking in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper with home delivery to a package on request.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four transaction packages implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in her press release of 8 March, reported that, even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still exhausting stocks within less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand for "no precedents", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had a "accent increase" last week, according to a spokesperson from Woolworths.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed for two packages last week.
To alleviate even more the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI previously made available stocks of a planned promotion for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Varejists, said that retailers try to increase stocks, but that restrictions of the local board regarding the frequency of delivery by truck make it difficult.
It expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to carry out the promotion of Wednesday.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, said the stores put the stock back every night.
He stressed that the toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, leaves many empty spaces in the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion [of] that if there was an abundant amount in the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be [bought] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce panic, said Russel Zimmerman to ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives the Crap said last Wednesday that they would be out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain the supply, according to news.com.au.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being conducted with buyers entering strike at the extended weekend of Labor Day.
The NT News Thursday edition, a Darwin daily print, included an eight-page insert in order to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Initially, the stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also with high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
Just as in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online Ocado supermarket limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandamia" indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to drive governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilize the population for a response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus, WHO's director-general.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and gravity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres, it is a "no precedent" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "outside the influence, no other respiratory virus was monitored from the emergence to the continuous global dissemination".
Hebreysus expressed a similar position, stating that "we had never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronary virus."
And he went on "and we've never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the outbreak, "in short, will get worse".
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 cronovirus pandemic is a continuous cronovirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by acute respiratory syndrome severe 2 cronovirus (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as an international public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
It is estimated that the mortality rate is 4% in China, while overall it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific antiviral vaccine or treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include handwashing, covering mouth when coughing, keeping away from people and monitoring and isolation of people suspected of infection.
The authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, pick-up touches, risk controls at the workplace and closure of establishments.
The pandemic caused a severe global socioeconomic interruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by panic - triggered purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the study population in the world.
Information on the virus spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with descent and appearance from east and south-east Asia and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy-duty closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
In large part, the cases were linked to the Huananan seafood wholesale market and therefore it is believed that the virus has zoonotic origin.
The outbreak causing virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has close connection to the coronaviruses of bats, pangolim and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms of having knowledge became ill on 1 December 2019 and did not have visible connections to the posterior group of the seafood market.
In the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two-thirds had links to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case pointed to 17 November 2019, in an individual aged 55 from Hubei province, who may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases declared decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases for the first time.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people 19 years of age or under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's leading scientific consultant, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive according to the official protocols.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries had adopted official policies not to test people only with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that, in China until January 23, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic number of reproduction (R0) for VOCID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with CVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being 14 days the most common.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, until February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official death count for the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and who had a positive test for CVID, according to the official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without the test, for example, who died at home, in homes of rest, etc.
The partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official count of COVID deaths by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesman for the U.S. disease control and prevention centres (CDCs) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of official deaths] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by episodes of undernotification reports in the U.S. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the swine influenza epidemic H1N1 in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time from the initial outbreak and by the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) until April 10, 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in persons with onset of symptoms between 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a disease, and the lethality rate of infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and not diagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not static over time and follow a specific population of the infection by resolution of the case.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Evidence-Based Medicine Center estimates that the lethality rate of infection for the pandemic is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this interval is compatible with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change according to the location.
Maciej Boni, from the State University of Pennsylvania, said that "without proper control, infectious epidemics usually reach their height and then decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when it will happen."
The senior medical adviser of the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "may end until June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, of London's Hygiene and Tropical Medicine School, declared that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably continue in circulation for a year or two".
According to the study by Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it is highly transmissible" and "that it may become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of the reappearance will depend on the group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion production (catarro), loss of olfactory sensation, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms are the difficulty in breathing, pain or pressure in persistent chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in walking and face and lips with blue coloring. It is recommended to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease may cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory discomfort syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with results of the tests that confirm the infection, therefore, researchers recommend that those who were in close contact with a person with confirmed infection are closely monitored and examined to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic ratio vary from some to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with CVID-19 who lost the olfactory sensation was initially 30% and then dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or talking, being the next contact considered from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breath drops can also be produced during expiration, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally in suspension.
The droplets can put into the mouths and noses of close people or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in air spread.
Propagation may also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that it can spread through the faeces, it is believed that the risk of this happening is low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oro-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only some reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission was identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that, although the ease with which the disease spreads is not fully clear, a person generally infected from two to three other people, the virus survives from hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304 for one day in paper and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Estimate animals and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to humans. However, the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with areas that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of coronovirus related to its nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by home soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
The genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgeneral Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same strain are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, at all levels of the genome, to other samples of coronaviruses coming from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolin virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the whole genome, up to now, found a maximum of 92% sharing of genetic material between the pangolim coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms. However, the definitive confirmation is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or computed tomography (TC).
A study in Wuhan, comparing RRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although it is less specific, with many of its image characteristics coincident with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC is not used for screening or as front-line test for the diagnosis of CVID-19".
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done in respiratory or blood samples.
Results are normally available from a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is performed in nasopharyngeal rubble, although the throat rubble is also used. Various laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these had been sufficiently precise to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex, in the United States, was approved for use in emergency only by certified laboratories.
The particularities of the X-rays and computed tomography (TC) images of symptomatic people include opacities in asymmetric peripheral dark glass and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an international online database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are limited in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the thoracic CT results to those of PCR and showed that although the image is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect image characteristics of the virus with X-rays and CT.
The strategies to avoid transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, hand washing, avoiding touch in the eyes, nose or mouth without washing, coughing or sneezing on a paper sheet and placing this canvas directly on a waste container.
It is advised who has already been infected to use a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential journeys going to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of Community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some community members do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that health professionals care for individuals who may be infected to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
The use by governments of localization data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with Anistia International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement asking for limits to this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to register a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as, for example, rinse your nose and throat with crops, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working for the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to avoid spreading the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty. You should also wash your hands before eating and after snoring your nose, cough or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand hygiene with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth without washing the hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (up to one minute of exposure to the disinfectant to a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71%, 50–100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2–7.5% iodopovidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorexidine glucone, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by sick people should be disinfected in case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 on a site.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the elbow folded or with a paper sheet when coughing or sneezing, as well as immediately discarding any sheet.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since using a mask may limit the volume and distance of expiring droplets when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "The use of masks can reduce the propensity of people touching their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without adequate hygiene of hands." It has also been recommended to use masks by caregivers of people who may have the disease.
WHO recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as the caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that using masks can help people not touch their faces.
In several countries, the use of masks for the public's face has begun to be encouraged.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of a non-medical mask for the face made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially by getting in close contact with another person (make 1 meter or less distance).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to use a surgical mask when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.
The health authorities of Thailand are encouraging people to make face masks at home and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without using a mask or cover the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all use facial masks when leaving in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone entering supermarkets should use a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to use masks for the face in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, demanded that passengers on inter-municipal trains and buses use masks for the face from 1 April.
In Panama, it is mandatory to use a mask for the face when going out on the street. At the same time, the production of masks at home was recommended for those who cannot buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the transmission of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centers.
Social distance methods can be applied by everyone when they stay at home, limit their travels, avoid crowded areas, use contactless greetings and keep away from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by the U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no knowledge of transmission of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at greater risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies have begun to replace the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term "social distancement" led to the implications that social isolation was needed completely instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with CVID-19 and for those who suspected that they were infected.
The health agencies issued detailed instructions for proper self-insulation. Many governments demanded or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive instructions of self-quarantine were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals were advised that they may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a large-scale country or region that make 14 days of autoquanteen since the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
The containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as to present other infection control measures and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are made to reduce: the measures taken now serve to reduce the speed of the spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time in combination.
The suppression calls for more extreme measures in order to reverse the pandemic to a basic rate of reproduction less than 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, involves trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. To this, we call "purchasing the epidemic curve".
Thus, the risk of overloading health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions which are not of a pharmaceutical nature and which may be able to administer the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks for the face and self-quarantine; Community measures aimed at physical distancement, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of events leading to agglomerations; Community involvement, in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental measures such as the cleaning of contact surfaces. More drastic actions, in order to contain the outbreak, were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak was clear.
Other countries have taken various measures to make the spread of the virus limited.
South Korea, for example, presented mass screening and localized quarantines. In addition, the government issued warnings on the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they performed self-quarantine and, for those who did not do so, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those that store medical supplies were punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (the slowdown in the rate of contamination, without stopping with the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (i.e., the reversal of the growth of the epidemic) present great challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce the peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, while overloading health systems.
The suppression may be the best alternative, but needs to be maintained while the virus is circulating by the human population or even the availability of a vaccine, if this occurs before. Otherwise, the transmission occurs again as soon as the relaxation of the measures occurs.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic brings social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts to develop medicines, which include the existing drug test.
The use of cold medicines that do not require medical prescription, drinking quite liquid and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, the use of oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid may be necessary.
The use of steroids may make the condition worse.
Several previously approved compounds to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also stated that some "home and traditional" medicines can alleviate the symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat outbreaks.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services to move, at various levels, their resources, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of CVID-19, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients with positive testing for CVID-19, as well as the increase in intensive care capacities through training of staff and the increase in the number of beds and fans available.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first known case in the new coronavirus dates from 1 December 2019, in Wuhan city, in Hubei province, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the Huananan Sea Fruit wholesaler market. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by doctor Zhang Jixian, at Hubei Provincial Hospital. The following day, the doctor informed the Center for Prevention and Control of Wohan Jianghan Diseases.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-type coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenenliang, were blamed by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was represented by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made a statement to the population on 31 December and informed WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to the Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread through other provinces of China, facilitated by the migration of the Chinese new year and the fact that Wuhan was a transport center, in addition to a main point of rail connection.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms until January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States exceeded China and Italy, with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
In view of the pandemic in Europe, many countries which are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The country's reactions included containment measures, such as quarantine (also known as house confinement orders, house containment orders or lockdowns) and pick-up touches. On 2 April, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are in some way confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, around 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on 1 December 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case of 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26th. His hospital reported the Center for Prevention and Control of Wuhang Jianghan Diseases on December 27th.
Initial genetic tests, on December 27, 2019, in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronary virus.
A release to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications took place, Wuhan doctors were warned by the police that they "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially argued that there is no "clear evidence" of transmission among human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "people's war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of humanity", a health cord was announced on January 23 to interrupt trips to Wuhan or back, which was extended by 15 cities of Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The commemorations of the Chinese new year, on January 25, were cancelled in several locations.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Hospital Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to care for more patients.
Together with the newly constructed hospitals, China converted 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention centres and stadiums. On 26 January, the government launched more measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issue of health statements for travellers and the expansion of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools in the whole country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken various measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Restrictions on travel were performed in Hubei and outside of it.
Public transport has been modified, and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
The public movement control was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) went through some sort of exit restriction. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
For example, it imposed a mandatory quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers who arrived in the city. On 23 March, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in this case, by means of a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, the Chinese premiere, Li Keqiang, reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown had been imposed. China’s Foreign Minister announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry of visa or residence permit individuals would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details on when that policy will be closed.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to businesses. The Council of State declared a day of mourning, beginning with a three-minute moment of silence in the whole country, on April 4 at 10 a.m., coincident with the Qingming Festival. However, the central government asked families to pay their tributes online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country's national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On 22 February, between the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were placed in quarantine after testing confirm that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The Airline Chronogram was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world’s largest and best organized program in terms of screening the population for the virus. The country also isolated infected people and tracked and placed in quarantine those who came in contact with them.
The screening methods included the mandatory individual report of symptoms for those arriving from international travel through a mobile application, testing the virus by drive-thru, with results available the following day, as well as increased test capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in the control of the outbreak, although it did not put whole cities into quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided as to the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans signed petitions requesting the impeachment of Moon under the allegation of poor government management of the outbreak, or raising its response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in four weeks.
On 29 March it was reported that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad should enter quarantine for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with the testing of the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included cancelling concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, closing universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran had five trillions of Riais for the fight against the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although a heavy traffic between cities before the New Year's Persian Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
In the midst of allegations of cover-up of the outbreak extension in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their cases related to Iran on 28 February, indicating that the outbreak extension could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government until that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed with 23 of its 290 members with positive testing for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch vehemently requested the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissidents, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The body said that there is a greater risk of virus spread in closed institutions as detention centers, which also suffer from the lack of medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number since the outbreak in the country.
At least 12 current or retired politicians and government officials died as a result of the disease until March 17.
Until March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to Coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five times more cases in Iran than is being reported.
It is suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may affect the country’s financial capacity to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights requested that economic sanctions be relieved for the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed as having spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to increase sharply, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare state of emergency.
A group not associated with COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, starting with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the emerging areas, people's entrances and exits are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On 4 March, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities by the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Series A football matches, have to be held at closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were suspended completely for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy went to China as the country with more deaths related to Coronavirus in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths related to the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical supplies to Italy.
From April 5, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus until that time may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the softest in the affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British Government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticisms for the recognized lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending the interruption of all non-essential and social contact trips, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and academies, should be closed as quickly as possible, and committed themselves to paying 80% of workers' salaries up to a limit of £2,500 per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distance measures, preventing crowding with more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activities to the minimum necessary.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police through the issue of fines and dispersion of agglomerations.
Most businesses received orders to close, with business exceptions considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and car workshop.

On the other hand, China's aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO observed the contrast between the SARS 2002-2004 outbreak, where the Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hindered the prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid panic near the festivities in the new lunar year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that "that was certainly not a WHO recommendation" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On 30 January, after the confirmation of transmission among humans out of China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as Public Health Emergency of International Scope (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the swine flu pandemic in 2009.
WHO's Director General, Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was invoked due to the "risk of global dissemination, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that needlessly interfere in international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and displacement."
On 5 February, WHO called on the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance a strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency to assist these countries that "have no systems in place to detect people who contracted the virus, even if it arises".
Tedros made further statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community to "invise now or will have to pay later." On 11 February, WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide the "power of the whole United Nations system as an answer".
The United Nations Crisis Management Team was activated, as a result, allowing the coordination of the entire response of the United Nations, which WHO states will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and developmental context resulting from the outbreak".
On 14 February, a WHO Joint Mission Team with China was empowered to provide assistance to international experts and WHO on land in China to domestic management and assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and field visits to assess "the impact of response activities on the levels of provinces and municipalities, including urban and rural panoramas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of Coronavirus", declaring that, although it was too early to declare a pandemic, countries should still set up "a stage of preparation".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that assessment of the global Coronavirus threat would be high from "high" to "very high", is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you need to be ready," insisting that correct response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also stated that current data did not authorize public health officers to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On March 11, WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "deeply concerned with alarming levels of dissemination and severity, and with alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced many criticisms and therefore was seen as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a petition from the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom to submit his resignation, signed by 733 thousand people on April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights specialists stressed respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone has the right to interventions to save life and that the government is responsible.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts pointed out that each individual has the right to health, including disabled people, minorities, the elderly, people with mental problems, the homeless, those living in conditions of extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups who need government assistance.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
Of the policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a Country Policy Tracker, which helps countries learn about each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, by the Minister of the United Kingdom, Michael Gove, and by the son of the president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro for the management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) were dismissed on account of their approach to the efforts related to quarantine in Central China, a sign of discontent the response of the political establishment to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was destined to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public anger in relation to the outbreak of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officers, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected an early recognition of the outbreak of Coronavirus that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 originating in the United States or Italy.
The administration of the United States of Donald Trump referred to Coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuh Virus" saying that China's censorship "surpassed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and "a way of diverting the failure in the administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has achieved a government cable from the United States a detailed communication strategy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being quoted as "This has everything to do with China.
We were advised to try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television shows. "Canals like Politics, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for a global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy leader, Josep Borrell, warned that there is "a geopolitical component including an influence struggle through a trendy and 'generous policies' point of view.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to suspend its sanctions to Syria, Venezuela and Iran while allegedly sending help to those countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on April 3rd.
The U.S. authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other nations to their own country.
And he hears disputes related to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of fans for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with those affected by Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The President of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio dispensed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov said that "to offer help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good stage, they would also act reciprocally if necessary."
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a small scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk not only the lives of the United States troops and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government was strongly affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen political or former political figures.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to the world’s leaders, asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying that his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts anticipate that this may negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a quarantine of two weeks at government designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions asking for the impeachment of Moon in relation to those they called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising their response. The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency laws as an answer.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could enable governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, to suspend parliament as well as elections and to punish those considered to have spread false news about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
Coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of shortage of supplies, resulting from increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-motivated purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The Food and Administration of the United States issued warnings on the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and interruptions of the supplier.
Several locations also experienced the panic-motivated shopping event leading to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in sending electronic products.
According to the Director-General of WHO Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protective equipment rose 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to 20 times the normal price and also caused delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, warning WHO that this would put workers’ health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for the Chinese buyers, he left, to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of baby formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared from an acute food shortage.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products were successful, avoiding the shortage of acute food that was foreseen in Europe as well as in North America.
North Italy with its significant agricultural production did not observe a large reduction, but prices can increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to maintain reserves for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was badly hit in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%.
Since mainland China is a large economy and manufacturing center, viral shock has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could surpass the 2002-04 SARS outbreak.
An estimate of a specialist at Washington University in St. Louis indicated an impact of $300 billion on the world supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is supposed to be "confounded" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to a low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside of China Continental.
On 27 February, due to increasing concerns about the outbreak of Coronavirus, several U.S. stock exchange indices including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones industry averaged their most significant falls since 2008, with Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest drop in one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All the other three indices ended the week with a lower than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH stated China’s sovereign credit rating but held a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of concerns with the coronavirus, the biggest fall on March 16.
Many consider a probable economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the state and central banks' timely emergency measures.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than they responded to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including tourist spots, and the recommendation of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British Flybe regional airline collapsed.
The impact on the cruises sector was of a level never seen.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the New Chinese Year's holiday.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the New Year's annual festivals, with private companies closing also independently their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many New Moon events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday to 10 February, instructing most of the workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has increased its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in the schedules of temporary stores or closings.
Visits to resellers in Europe and Latin America fell 40%.
The resellers of North America and the Middle East observed a 50-60% fall.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
The global Shopping Center operators imposed additional measures, such as greater cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check buyer temperature, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers were left home in inner provinces or arrested in Hubei province. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for government assistance.
The outbreak of the Coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid by means of daily remuneration) unemployed. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have gone through some kind of unemployment. Almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the confinement in mid-March 2020.
During the second 15th of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment aid and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit programme. Almost half a million companies in Germany put their workers under reduced working hours subsidized by the government known as Kurzabeit.
The German low-time work programme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
Performatic arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations, as well as the people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
The arts and culture sector organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public and help artists whenever possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance sites, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and high-speed impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film sector also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of the Holy Week in Rome, which would occur during the last week of the period of the Christian Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that elderly Christians stay at home than to attend Mass on Sundays; some churches have made available the services of the church via radio, live online streaming or television while others offer drive-in-style cults.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the square of St. Peter empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled the services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurduras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims, as well as its residents in sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant interruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered in the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled for a date after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021". Casinos and other games locations around the world were closed and presence poker tournaments were also postponed or cancelled.
This led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with several music groups suspending or canceling their tournaments.
Many large theaters like Broadway also canceled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as shows with live transmission or creating "festive" online for artists to present themselves, share and disseminate their work.
On-line, several memes on the Internet about the coronavirus are propagated, as many seek humor and entertainment in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people from focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidences of fear, distrust, and hostility were observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February results (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserve the virus or are receiving a just punishment for what they caused.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed to those in areas affected by the virus.
After the rise in new focus countries, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions by pressuring the ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to the Trending Topics on Twitter.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronary virus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Demonstrators in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from north-east India, which borders China, and students in large cities in India allegedly suffered persecution related to the outbreak of coronary virus.
The president of the unity in the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that's why God turned against them".
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, who called it "wrong." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign waste" and targets of "displace".
Many newspapers with paid access removed them from some or all coverages on the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have made available scientific articles related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their conclusions as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for the 2019 coronary artery respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by the RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (sorology) can be used for population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very mild to be reported or who were asymptomatic.
A precise rate of disease mortality and the level of livestock immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were considerable variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variability probably still substantially affects the mortality rates of registered cases, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or saliva sample.
The results are generally available within a few hours or within 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharynx rubble is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected persons tested in the second week, as an alternative, the material of the samples can be removed from the bottom of the respiratory tract by suction catheter or material ejected by expectoration (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the actual reverse-time polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-CoV-2-based SARS detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive the approval for emergency use of China's National Medical Products Administration for the PCR-CoV-2 SARS detection kit. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel for the RTR-PCR (2019-nCoV) in real-time for public health laboratories by International Reagent Resource.
One of the three most ancient versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests due to failure reagents, and a barrier to the CDC testing in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout the month of February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only from then on local and state laboratories were allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an authorisation for emergency use. The commercial laboratories started the tests at the beginning of March 2020.
From 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for COVID-19 based RT-PCR.
The Quest Diagnostics also made the tests for COVID-19 nationally available from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restrictions have been announced; the collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Sanitary Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic stated that it had developed a test to detect the infection with COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours on a wide scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) for Abbott laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA issued a prior authorisation for Holic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received a US FDA test which takes about 45 minutes.
FDA approved a test using the amplification technology of nucleic acid isothermic rather than PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and specifically binds it to the protein of the new coronovirus (N protein) nucleocapsidus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "thorax X-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the initial stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, may be present even before symptoms arise."
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar opacity in dark glass with a later, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve according to the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, with many of its image aspects coincident with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that the "TC should not be used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial verification.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days ago or soon after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in the monitoring of the population. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by means of remote laboratory tests (PoCT).
The automated systems of high productivity in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to accompany the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection stage is not necessary before the test. On 26 March 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and from now on are able to distribute their antibody tests.
From 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by FDA with an authorisation for emergency use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their testing kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in question of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
The antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the kits of acquired antibodies tests were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which the suspected patients may stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they must fire saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result later. British NHS has announced that it is coordinating a system to test the suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they are in the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used. In the drive-through tests for COVID-19 in suspected cases, a health professional collects samples taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea perform some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March that it had the capacity for about 12,000 outpatient care tests per day, and 10,700 had been tested the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany has remained unknown, since only the positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020, a total of 483.295 samples have been tested until the 12th week of 2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the hospitals Technion and Rambam developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, gathering samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory of 2000 m2 for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: . . . . . . or "Fire Eye" in English) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and for 5 days, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled if this test capacity did not have an online access.
The Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by the Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily income was 50,000 tests per day. Open-source multiplexed models published by Origami Assays were released as being able to test up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19, using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without the need of robotic manipulators for liquids.
In March, insufficient shortage or quantities of reagents became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols involving the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the genomes of the RNA for additional tests. On 31 March, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates are now doing more tests per capita in their population for the Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on their way to increase the level of testing and reach most of the population.
This resulted in a combination of drive-thru capacity, and acquisition of a mass-scale processing laboratory of Group 42 and BGI (inspired by their emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to operate outside China.
Different methods of testing for different components of the coronary artery genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany's method of manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that have no recourse to develop their own.
The German method was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centre was not available until January 28, there was a delay in the tests made available to the US and China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of the testing kits as well at the beginning of the outbreak, in addition, those countries with Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and the testing recommendations made by health professionals.
On the other hand, experts claim that the wide availability of South Korea for testing helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The test capacity, largely in the private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs such as the best way to delay the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be delayed in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of cottons and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported specific problems in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "false"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the particular tests. Spain acquired testing kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the undisputed results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a failure in the collection of samples or the incorrect use of kits.
The Minister of Spain said that he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China generated wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million testing kits from China considered imprecise.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. At Kara’s Turkish Ministry of Health said that the kits of Turkish tests purchased from China had a “high error rate” and that they would not “use it”. The United Kingdom acquired 3.5 million testing kits from China, but in early April 2020 it announced that they were not useful.
The test, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
The researchers who work in the Italian city of Vò, the place of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, performed two stages of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases discovered were placed in quarantine.
With the displacement to the restricted commune, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore in 2020 has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to strongly advise the inhabitants to stay home on March 28, but the schools reopened after the vacation on March 23.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that countries that performed more tests, compared to the number of deaths, had more lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with no or little symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the table below, the column "Positive in % of tests" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country testing only people in hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they present symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Washing hands (or cleaning hands), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
The washing of hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by gold-feal route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucosa).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's bubble or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling meat, francs or raw fish.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends the hygiene of the hands:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After snoring your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, feed, or discards of animals.
The clinical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main objective of hand-washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemical substances that may cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who manage food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronary artery disease and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the infant mortality rate in births performed at home.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for handwashing can lead to small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, the infant mortality rates related to diarrhoea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to poor areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes may be associated with hand washing with soap. The washing of hands with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (IRAs), such as automatic behavior in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, main IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the life of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and joint pneumonia are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, transform washing hands with soap before eating and after using the bathroom in a entrenched habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhea deaths by almost half and deaths of acute respiratory infections in one room.
Handwashing is usually associated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities (WASH).
Washing hands also protects against the impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of handwashing is that frequent handwashing can cause skin damage due to skin re-drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive handwashing can lead to a condition of peeling and irritation in the skin known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health system workers.
Frequent handwashing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (TOC).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (miction, defecation), after cleaning a child's bubble (hiking diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling meat, fish or raw chicken.
Other situations where the correct technique for hand-washing should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treatment of a cut or injury; after sneezing, coughing or snoring the nose; after playing animal jets or dealing with animals; and after playing in waste.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of the families had the habit of hand washing with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest index of 97 percent; the United States near the average of 77 percent; and China with the lowest index of 23 percent. Various methods for behavioural changes currently exist to increase acceptance of the habit of hand washing with soap in critical periods. Collective hand washing for children in schools at certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to affect handwashing in children's habits.
The " Essential Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote the health and education of children.
The disappearance twice a year, complemented by daily hand washing with soap, brushing the teeth daily with fluoride, are at the center of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms is reinforced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution, and to increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic dirt, are not easily dissolved in water.
The cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain the accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated bar soap concluded that transmission is unlikely as bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic dosing commands is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps were widely disseminated to the public aware in terms of health.
To date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can lead to the selection of antibiotics-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, although strains resistant to antibiotics are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a regulator of pH, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, vegetable extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health has indicated that common soaps are as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps aimed at the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for handwashing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster in body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove the natural oiliness that holds dirt and bacteria.
Unlike popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective to reduce the microbial load in the hands.
A hand hygienic or antiseptic is a non-aqueous basic hand hygiene agent.
At the end of the 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcohol-based basic hand hygiene agents (also known as a product for alcohol-based hand hygiene, antiseptic hand hygiene, or hand hygiene) began to gain popularity.
The majority is made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thick agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), gel, or umectant, such as glycerin, liquid, or foam to facilitate use and reduce the effect of resecrating alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hands hygienics containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs with efficiency.
Alcohol-based hygienics kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygienizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels reduction) of bacteria in their hands, 30 seconds after their application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in their hands 1 minute after their application. Hands hygienicizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand hygienicizers are almost totally ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for the hands or alcohol-based hygienics can be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their ends are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be well washed, being rubbed with both palms. The Center for Control and Disease Prevention recommends handwashing with hand hygienicizers, especially when the hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid exterminating action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand hygienicizers may cause skin re-drive unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of resecrating alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerine and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-containing hand hygienicizers containing emollients caused substantially less irritation and skin re-drying than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in the hands hygiene based on alcohol rarely occur.
The lower tendency to provoke irritable contact dermatitis has become an attractive compared to the washing of hands with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, basic agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, they only disinfect them.
That is why hand hygiene is not as effective as water and soap for preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hands hygiene is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and has historically been far from alcohol-based and alcohol-based hygiene.
More recently, formulations that use benzalconium chloride revealed to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, different from alcohol, which showed to have reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse reactions in the skin.
Many people in low-income communities are unable to afford a soap and instead use ash or soil.
Ash or earth can be more effective than pure water, but can be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct technique for hand washing recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centre to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or hot running water.
Current water is recommended as fixed sinks may be contaminated, while water temperature does not seem to be relevant.
rub hands, friction them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of the hands, the space between the fingers and under the nails.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when soap is used instead of pure water.
Refrigerate for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and rub for a longer time removes more germs.
Dry well with running water.
Washing on a plate can recontaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let dry out.
Wet or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, fingers and under nails.
Artificial enamels and laminated enamels can accommodate microorganisms.
It is often recommended moisturizing lotion to keep your hands hydrated; dry skin may cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of infection transmission.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand-washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or cook with appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "improvised towers" and other low-cost options.
An improvised tap is a simple technology that uses a suspension jar by a rope, and a lever driven by the feet to clear a small amount of water in the hands and a soap bar.
The effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way to drying in public bathrooms.
An increasing volume of research suggests that towel paper is much more hygienic than the electric dryers of hands found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the towel paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene presented by the towel paper, hand dryers with warm air and the most modern hand dryers with air jet.
After washing and drying the hands with a heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air jet dryers resulted in an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, 42% in the palm area near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also performed tests to define whether there was potential cross contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which projects air outside the unit at specified speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hands and drive potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of hot-air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Towel paper did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Productt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers were compared to drying with towel paper.
Washing hands with wet wet sheets for hand hygiene is an alternative to lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand hygienicizers shall contain at least 60% alcohol.
The clinical handwashing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficacy (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
The clinical hand washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous quantities of soap and water or gel to flavour and rub all parts of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the fingers interlacing.
If there are waste under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can stay in water in their hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the tap (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents hands from being recontaminated by these surfaces.
The objective of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germes") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains in unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that adequate hand washing and other simple procedures may decrease the rate of infections in the bloodstream related to catheter in 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a newsletter demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and friction in the health system sectors.
The organization's hygiene guidance project can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable revision was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate hand hygiene if the regulatory compliance demonstration is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for handwashing:
after exposure to body fluids/bloods
before an ascetic task, and
after patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (sabonets "medicine" or "antimicrobials") confers an exterminating action on a hand washing agent.
This exterminating action may be desirable before performing a surgery or in situations where antibiotics are prevalent. To "clean" hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, some chlorexidine or iodine antiseptics, towels sterilized to dry the hands after washing, and a sterilized brush for cleaning and other sterilized instruments for cleaning under the nails.
All jewels should be removed.
This procedure requires washing of hands and forearms up to elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms should not run into the hands.
After the washing of the hands is completed, the hands are dried with a sterilized towel and the surgical robe is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand-cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and a significant additional benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Washing with common soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing the hygiene of hands with an alcohol-based solution with the washing of hands with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds for each revealed that the alcohol-based hand hygienicizer reduced bacterial contamination by 26% to more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand hygienicizers to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and difficult Clostridium spores in the hands. Interventions to increase the hygiene of hands in hospital environments may involve awareness of the team about handwashing, increased availability of alcohol-based wipers and verbal and written warnings to the team.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are more efficient in different health institutions.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for better health and nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable sources of water, soap or resources for hand washing in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the achievement of the universal practice of hand washing.
For example, in most rural Africa taps for hand washing close to any public or private bathrooms are rare, although there are cheap options for the construction of hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may instead be the result of root habits rather than the absence of soap and water.
Incentive and defense of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to a change in long-term behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand-washing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting hand-washing in schools is the UNICEF "Three Star Approach" that encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the top three stars.
Construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the promotional hand-washing campaigns carried out in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The world day for handwashing is another example of awareness campaign that attempts to achieve a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronary virus pandemic, UNICEF has released the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to classification in DALY.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting the washing of hands with soap is significantly more profitable than other interventions of water and sanitation.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances like mothers who have just given birth or soldiers injured in hospitals — was initially recognized in the middle of the nineteenth century by two precursors of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that the infections were caused by unpleasant odors called myasms.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food origin and infections associated with health care led the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention to encourage more actively hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine influenza in 2009 and the incidence of COVID-19 in 2020 resulted in increased awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "adequate hand-washing techniques" were hung close to hand-washing plates in public bathrooms and bathrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands" means declaring the reluctance to take responsibility or to be conjugated with something.
It originated from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed the hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a more general phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience in relation to the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also observed that people, after remembering or witnessing anti-ethical acts, tend to wash their hands more frequently than others, and usually give more importance to equipment for hand washing.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of "cleanness", such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of hands characteristic in many religions, including the bahá'í faith, Hinduism, tevilah and the netilat yadayim in Judaism, the wash in Christianity, and the ablution in Islamism. Religions also indicate the hygienic washing of hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam authorize the washing of hands after the use of the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam authorize the washing of hands before and after meals.
Hazard controls at the workplace for COVID-19
Hazard controls at work for COVID-19 are the application of health and safety methodologies at work for hazardous controls for the prevention of coronovirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and on the work itself, based on the risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the contraction of CVID-19.
According to the Department of Health and Occupational Safety (OSHA), functions with lower exposure risk have minimal occupational contact with the public and other working colleagues, for which basic measures to prevent infection are recommended, including hand-washing, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, maintain a respiratory label and routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Functions with an average exposure risk include those requiring frequent or direct contact with persons on whom they are not known to be contaminated or suspected of being contaminated by COVID-19, but may be infected due to existing Community transmission or travelling abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public as in schools, working environments of high population density, and in the large volume retail market.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with use of high efficiency air filters, protective coverage and provision of individual protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health system workers and necrosters who are exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures in people with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of generating aerosols and collect or handle specimens of these people.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COPID-19 epidemic may have various effects on the workplace.
Workers can get out of work because they are sick, because they have to take care of other people or because they are afraid of a possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of which products are in demand and of the means of purchasing these products (such as shopping outside peak time or by delivery services or drive-thru.
Finally, sending items of areas seriously affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protection actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors of individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls needed to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action plans and preparation for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a structure widely used in the health and safety of work to group the controls of danger by effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve the isolation of employees from work-related hazards without counting the behavior of the worker, and may be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the policy or work procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of the worker's hazard, adjusted as necessary (e.g. breathers), used properly and continuously, inspected regularly, preserved and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), work with low exposure risk has minimal occupational contact with the public and other working colleagues.
Basic recommended infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous hand-washing, incentives for workers to stay at home if they are sick and use the respiratory label, including capping the spirro and cough, preparation of sheets and common waste containers, preparation for telework or step-by-step shifts, if necessary, disincentive of the use of tools and equipment of other workers, and maintenance of a routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and other people at the workplace.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who present symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until they have no more fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or alleviation of other symptoms, and also recommends that disease licensing policies be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to take care of a family member, and that they have knowledge of these policies.
According to OSHA, studies with average exposure risk include those requiring frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people on whom it is not known whether they are confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to the current community transmission in the company's locality, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad, in a country with high transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who have contact with the public in general, such as schools, high population density workplace environments, and some high density work environments and some shops stores of high volume sales volume sales volume. Engineering engineering controls for this group and for groups of higher risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters in general as in schools as in schools, high population density work environments, high-density workplace environments, and some high-population sales volume retail shops and some shops shops and some high volume sales volume retail shops. Engineering engineering checks for this group and higher-risk groups include the installation of high-risk air filters, the installation of high efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation Centres, the installation of physical barriers, the cancellation of non-essential plastic travel facilities for places with current COVID-19, the development of a drive-through drive-through window, the development of communication plans for this group and groups of greater communication, including a forum forum to answer questions questions for workers, the training of training and training on

Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the isolation of the other person's sick person from a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer her a facial mask, or ask the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with torso or sneez.
The crew should use disposable medical gloves when serving a patient or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient is suffering from fever, persistent cough or difficulty in breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items shall be disposed of in a bag for biological waste, and contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, dangerous controls shall include the postponement of the journey by the patient passenger, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical centre on board if someone has a fever or other symptoms during the trip.
The ideal is that medical follow-up occurs in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large groupings such as physical or coral education classes, or meals in a luncheon, increasing the space between tables, arrival times and more rigid departure, limitation of non-essential visitors and use of a separate health care place for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, prolonged school dispensations can be considered. For law enforcement authorities carrying out daily activities, the risk to immediate health is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers contact individuals suspected of CVID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medicine technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers must clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow the standard operational procedures for the containment and disposition of PPE used and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health workers and necrosteries as being in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
Functions with high exposure risk include workers in the delivery of medicines, medical care, laboratories and medical transport, which are exposed to confirmed or suspected CVID-19 patients.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosols generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected CVID-19, or collect or manage specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive specimen collection.
Work in high-exposure necrosteries includes workers involved with the preparation of bodies of people with confirmed VOCID-19 or suspected of the disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure of becoming very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected VOCID-19, including when aerosol generating procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure can be adequate in some scenarios of necroterics and in the health area.
Specimens should be handled with caution at level 3 of biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter the hospital be separated in two distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspicious case for COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, the OSHA recommends respirators for professionals who work at a distance of 6 feet of patients with confirmation or suspected of infection with SARS-CoV-2, and for professionals who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, facial respirators with N95 particles filtration, approved by NIOSH or superior quality respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO only recommends a surgical mask for screening employees at the point of entry.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with VOCID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial protection, surgical aprons and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the overall supply of PPEs is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPEs through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients to enter into a comfortable with a patient with COVID-19, using only the necessary PPE for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it while treating several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of PPE and disstimulating the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

Subject: [Chovid-19] Attenuation of problems and preparation for the future
Date/time of dispatch: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have in relation to the other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and community-building, which are the foundations of this organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, connections and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege to work.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have you all as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their recognition for our work.
This person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol that this essential resource continues online and is available to all.
The work of you makes this possible, as you keep the active workplaces, pay our coworkers and maintain the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the next few days and months.
At that meeting, we consider what we think is an appropriate action to which we are experiencing and how best to maintain the sustainable organization in that period.
We want to end the stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to go away for a while, it's okay.
For all employees, service providers and employees by contract:
our daily job expectations will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise arranged.
We are not declaring a holiday. If you can work at normal time, it may be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy supplies or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
That rule would not need to be expressed, but we have decided to declare it.
You do not need proof or pay leave. Just inform your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that the key areas of work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification sector so that his sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention).
The staff who works per hour will receive the full payment.
We have said that before, and we are committed to honoring our commitment to our contractors and employees who work for an hour.
Everyone will receive their salaries on the basis of their normal work record under normal circumstances.
Salaries are independent if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give total support to you.
Many people view work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just ask you to communicate to your manager, so we know what to expect and we can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to play.
Sites, HR, Trust and Security Engineering and Funding (among others) teams perform essential activities that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
To slow down now will not harm us in the future.
We have no intention of "working bent to recover lost time" after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that the circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new goals and deadlines, as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust our new reality and expectations for hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide a longer time for the budget, and that employees prioritize essential work, personal care and care for loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced journey in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, by caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the office of San Francisco.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the inlet gauge and all elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is using its own protocol of care duties using products that are safe for its customers.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to come back.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol to the COVID-19 with us and with all employees in Washington.
Last week, our office in Washington changed to a totally remote configuration, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we're also discussing renting an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to occur, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
They shall limit the duration of meetings to no more than one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider dividing them in several days.
They define the meeting, have a schedule and forward material for reading in advance.
Use the videos as the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate real-time collaboration and connection.
They have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone who monitors questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make annotations (or collaborative annotations).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency help to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching on ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to assist in increasing remote work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editing marathons, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions could prevent the completion of their agreed grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying their goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be of sadness with paralysis, but also of relief with clarity and ability to keep focus on their own communities, in Wikimedia and in other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a page in Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Maintaining up-to-date on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with employees.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in it together and we'll help with whatever we need.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this email and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company's wiki.
The communication resource team will update these pages and all information in a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees who live in countries significantly affected today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, do not stop notifying you and working with the communication resources team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive subject, send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of HR Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that at present our work and obligations will probably need to be adapted in a way that we do not adapt in the past.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary as support right now, so that we can continue to work, providing to our movement the support they need and providing the world the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be our wait when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months after.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need everyone to take care of you and your family so that they are in their best condition when necessary.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communication resources team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the remaining leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the lungs cells, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of angiotensin-related converting enzyme (ACA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), becoming a promising drug directed to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also works as an entry point in cells for some coronary viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
Type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme that contains zinc located on the endothelial surface and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an M2 N-terminal peptidase domain and a C-terminal amino acid transporter and colectrin domain in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single passage type 1 membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released in the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is attached to the cell membrane of the main type II alveolar pulmonary cells, enterocytes of the thin intestine, endothelial arterial and venous cells and smooth arterial muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of ECA2 mRNA is also found in cerebral cortex, striated body, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight for ECA.
ECA cleavages type I angiotensin hormone in type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2, in turn, phenylalanine of carboxitermal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
The ECA2 also clivas several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradykinine, apiline, neurotensine, dinorphine A, and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the transport through the membrane of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 works as the main entry point in cells for some coronoviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme in endossomes located inside the cells.
This process of entry also requires the preparation of the S protein by the serine-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing the levels of ECA2 in cells might help in the fight against infection.
However, various professional societies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing with the ACE inhibitory pattern and ARB therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia in relation to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with CVA and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
It is believed that recombinant human ECA2 (rhACE2) is a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury, and it appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with an acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolissaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of the effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to the inhibitors of the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where angiotensin II is in circulation is high. RhACE2 infused was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Applications on CVID-19 are mobile software applications to help monitor in response to the coronovirus pandemic 2019-2020, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have contacted infected individuals.
Numerous applications were developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Various structures for creating contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographic location of the application users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to register user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they were in contact with a person carrying COVID-19.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and offer a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government declared that the contact tracking application was in advanced development stage, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand provide applications based on the TraceTogether application of Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if acceptance of the application is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the dissemination of fake or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple sets limits for the types of organizations that can add cronavirus related applications to its App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronary virus applications, especially if the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronary virus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
Anistia Internacional and more than 100 other organizations have issued a communiqué asking for limits for this type of surveillance.
The organisations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the safety and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid worsening discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for in law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuses;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health specialists and marginalized groups. The German Computer Club (CCC) Chaos and Borderless Reporters (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating system devices when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a series of systems that preserve privacy were created to use central servers only for intercom (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system gathered tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate text messages for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government also made localization information publicly available, which is permitted due to the comprehensive changes to the information confidentiality laws after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a series of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralized system.
By 6 April 2020 the details had not yet been disclosed.
Contact tracking preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography dating back to, at least, 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups have worked on privacy-respecting solutions, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register a user's proximity to other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that includes centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include Decentralized privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never comes out of the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during collection and use of localization or crossing data to track the propagation of COVID-19.
It is based on the research from the technical publication "Applicatives play dirty: keeping personal privacy in an epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a footprint that develops privacy technologies and originally founded on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and managers, without compromising the privacy of this data.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Coalition Global was founded by groups that joined around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapped with protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing the global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the achievement of widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government application, became open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, claiming that they would preserve privacy, based on a Bluetooth Low Energy technology combination and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system foresees implementation in three stages:
development of tools to allow the government to create official cronovirus tracking applications preserving privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to deal with persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system for system upgrades in operation, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug replication, reperfilation, retribution or therapeutic replacement) is the proposal of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the scientific research lines that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drugs, each with multiple binding points.
Analyze these binding points provides the reasonable design of effective antiviral drug development against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the protease similar to papaine, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, S protein, and ribophosphatase ADP.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that later refined and analyzed for their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in its preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquina is a drug against malaria that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the clinical trial Solidarity.
The governor of New York Andrew Cuomo announced that tests with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine of the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, FDA authorized the use of chloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
The treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trials process and is authorized by the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when "there's no other option."
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Large studies are ongoing at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medicine School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen demonstrated that favipyravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipyravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the evidence available to base the medicine is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase Japan's medicine to store it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with CVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for Trump administration on the purchase of the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in severe cases of the disease when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit has been observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that connects to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to repropose specifically developed drugs for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences discovered after remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against wire, pneumonia, paramixo, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which can cause more severe transmissions or diseases.
Some initial pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
There are three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials that occur for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19: two of them are placebo controlled (in China and Canada), while the other has no control group (Italy).
New York State began testing azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans a clinical test of the Alvesco (cyclesonide) of Teijin, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The objective is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronary virus.
Phase II of a study with angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is underway with 200 patients, to be recruited between severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria, to determine the efficacy of treatment.
Currently, researchers from the Heart Institute in Canada are researching the role of colchicin in reducing pulmonary complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COPID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over 40 years of age, diagnosed with CVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Women who are breast-feeding or do not use effective contraceptive methods were not included in the tests.
Several anticoagulants are tested in Italy.
Heparin, low molecular weight, is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on use.
A multicenter study, with 300 patients, is analyzing the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages. The study was announced on April 14, Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable in the sense of giving new purpose to approved and developed antiviral drugs for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics were identified as being able to receive a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also there are tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronary artery disease (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the clinical tests completed, there are several attempts in progress to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a virus that caused the disease, available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A great spread of the outbreak occurred in 2020, leading to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, stated in April that the needs for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, ECI scientists reported 10 platforms of diverse technologies being researched and developing during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The goals of the major platforms that advanced to phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by ECPI scientists in April, a total of 115 candidates for vaccine are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). 37 others were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being planned).
A phase I-II test performs the preliminary safety and immunogenicity test. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multicenter, while at the same time determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while monitoring adverse effects on the ideal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccine (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 had not yet been evaluated in humans (they are still in preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular staple, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, Canada, the International Vaccination Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, announced the beginning of the work in a vaccine, with the objective of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccines development projects were announced at the China Disease Prevention and Control Centre on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, the pharmaceutical companies Janssen, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the beginning of their work for the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with her biotechnology partner in Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the preparation of a similar technology vaccine used for neo-antigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25 the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary company of Generex, NuGenerex Immmnuno-Oncology, announced that they were starting a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "in the next 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in the western Maryland region, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that he joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the preclinical test and phase I of clinical studies in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated step, it would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a particle similar to Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is researched in the laboratory, with the human tests planned for July or August 2020.
At the beginning of that week, The Guardian stated that the President of the United States, Donald Trump offered CureVac "great sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under protest from the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop a mRNA vaccine together.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently in a preclinical test, with clinical tests expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and its candidate to the final vaccine could start for human tests in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research consortium for the vaccine for COVID-19 involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, leading the total investment of CEPI in the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 to 29 million.
The other ECI investment partners for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, health authorities in Russia announced that scientists began testing in animals of six different candidates to the vaccine.
Researchers at Imperial College in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing an auto-amplifier RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The applicant for the vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of the sequencing of China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the initiatives of the University of Saskatchewan.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vacine Bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other outbreaks of Coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that "MNA delivered vaccines from the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 that triggered powerful responses of specific antibodies to antigens [in the mouse] that were evident that started 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacterium to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus of SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined resources to access IBM supercomputers in combination with the cloud computing of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond the disease that it prevents.
A randomized posterior test in Australia is seeking to register 4,170 health workers.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using specimens of animals specific to COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate a need for containment measures for level 3 biosecurity to manipulate live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in specimens of non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARS that has been safe and effective in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
From March 2020, there was a vaccine against MERS (based on DNA) that completed phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are vectorized vaccines by viruses, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind the CVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by several publications on social media indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of the Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
Exposure time up to the beginning of symptoms is about 5 days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
From 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have already been cured. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually by means of drops produced by cough, spiral or speech.
Although these droplets are produced upon expiry, they usually fall to the ground or remain on surfaces rather than remain infectious in long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although dissemination may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by chain reaction of the actual reverse transcription polymerase (RRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people with suspicion of the virus and for people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of mask by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend not to use, some recommend the use and others make the use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries by all six WHO regions.
Virus infected patients may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty keeping awake, face or lips blue.
Less common, symptoms of upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, sliding nose or throat pain can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only breast tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease can evolve to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is normally six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of the people who develop the symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The role these asymptomatics play in transmission is not yet fully known; however, a preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The escalator and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Talking high releases more drops than normal.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally carried by air, the National Academy of Science suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside the rooms of the people contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore airborne.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through faeces, if it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that, although it is not fully clear how easily the disease is spread, a person normally infected by one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on the surface.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
This, however, depends on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Products with soap degrade the lipid protective envelope of the virus, disabling it, as well as eliminating it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after initiation of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, while the sixth patient presented the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The coronary artery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronary artery of the acute respiratory syndrome that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who had a relationship with a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is intimately connected to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells by means of the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spice" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of infected people who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high thanks to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease evolution, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropics for respiratory tract epithelial cells expressing ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it has been shown that pathogenic T cells that secrete GM-CSF have a correlation with the recruitment of IL-6 secretory inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported in necropsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction via reverse real-time transcription (RRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in respiratory samples obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or catarro sample may be used.
Results are usually available in a few hours up to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a coronovirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, testing using antibodies (which can detect active infections and if a person was infected in the past) were developing, but have not been widely used yet.
The experience of the Chinese with the test showed that their accuracy is 60-70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in bilateral multilobar dark glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (lobular septos thickened with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available regarding microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisia, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyt hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ASD) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukarythroblast reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with hands without washing.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a toss or sneezing cloth, as well as cover the mouth with the inner side of the elbow if the sheet is not available.
The proper hygiene of the hand after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restrict travel and cancel large public meetings.
The distancement guidelines also include that people stay at least 1.8 meters (6 feet) away from each other.
Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, also known as "purchasing the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after snoring their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using antiseptic for hands alcohol base with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where commercial hand antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity occurs through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for the asepsis of the hands".
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect that they are with the virus use a simple facial mask.
The oxygenation of the extracorporeal membrane (CEMO) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and lifestyle and healthy diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those people with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with CVID-19.
U.S. Intensive Physicians and Pneumologists gathered recommendations for the treatment of various agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Caution is needed to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures are being performed that can generate aerosols such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health professionals looking after people with CVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with isolation of airborne infections (SIIA) as well as taking standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: EPI blanket, respirator or facial mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use respirators instead of facial masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but FDA authorised the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
They were designed to protect against air particles as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-described uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of VOCID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure at two levels.
If one of these two brings the same benefits to people who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits that aerosol particles spread, when compared to the high flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in the elderly (those over 60 years and especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have per capita hospital beds in sufficient quantity, which limits the ability of the health system to deal with the sudden escalation in the number of cases of VOCID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators that have pressure control mode and high PEEP level are required to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pulmonary lesions and pneumothorax associated with ventilation.
High level PEEP may not be available in older fans.
The research for potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical tests are being performed with several antiviral medicines.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take up to 2021 to be developed, several of the tested medicines have already been approved for other uses or are in the advanced phase of testing.
Antiviral medicine can be tested in people with various diseases.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in tests of effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA gave temporary authorisation for plasma use of convalescent people as treatment in cases where the life of the person is serious and immediately threatened.
Clinical studies required to show their safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been performed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to report their name and ID number.
The application can detect the "near contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends quarantine as well as alert local health authorities. Big data data analysis of mobiles, facial recognition technology, mobile telephony tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people they had contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorised security agencies to track mobile telephone data of people who are supposedly with coronary viruses.
The measure has been taken to strengthen quarantine and to protect people who can contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone location data with the agency of the German federal government, Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent the transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect who breaks the quarantine.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that "40% of people still circulate anyway".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackaton at the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said, "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis is a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a mild evolution, with few or no symptoms, and it seems to be other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take from three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is no data from COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospital admissions with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COPID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median manifestation of initial symptoms up to death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem samples show diffuse alveolar damage with exudates cell fibromysoids in both lungs.
Viral cytostatic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image examination looked like acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, damage to the heart was detected due to the high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
Coorbidity mortality estimates vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The underreporting of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of CVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die, compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authority found a 20% to 30% fall in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage to the organ.
This may also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as probable, based on the behavior of other coronary veins, but cases were reported in which the recovery of COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronaryvirus at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin, by means of transhipment infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but since December 2019, the spread of infection has become almost entirely driven by the transmission of human to human beings.
A study with the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 at The Lancet, revealed that the oldest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of the onset of symptoms as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and with time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of health system, treatment options, time elapsed since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in laboratory and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall mortality rate was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the mortality rate by case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed who die from a disease, and the mortality rate by infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) individuals who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited to time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by CVID-19 should have been formally recorded as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had death by COVID-19 confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50-year-old age group, with the difference between men and women only approaching 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immune differences due to sex, lower prevalence of smoking women and the development by men of comorbidities as hypertension at a lower age than women may have contributed to the higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on sex-related CVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women of different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, explained that "CO" is "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g.: China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international recommendations to prevent stigmatizations. The virus that causes COVID-19 was called a severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19" and "COVID-19" virus in communication to the public.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuh coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease for 2019-nCov" as interim names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 guidance against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal gargots and respirator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on the necessary schedule, a local startup did reverse engineering and printed the 100 required valves from one day to the next.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, there were conspiracy theories, wrong information and misinformation about the origin, dimension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicinal product or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is underway in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Solidarity Trial" to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with most likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV are being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the integral virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection of CVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research concentrates on the epicule protein that helps the virus enter the receptor of the ACE2 enzyme.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless copied genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent improvement was pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 ongoing clinical trials since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs makes up most of the Chinese researches, with nine clinical tests in phase III of remdesivir in several countries due to an end-April report.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was ongoing in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicinal products are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is an attempt to prove the efficacy of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical tests are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquina, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for a peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although it recommends a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine the criterion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be more studied in vivo after a low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated. Studies have shown that the protein of the initial spicula in preparation for the transmembranar serum 2 protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have great limitations that prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm may be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine timeless properties. Tocilzumabe was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the conclusion of a small study.
A non-randomized test in phase 2 of the national level in Italy is underway, after having shown positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of death of some affected people.
Interleucin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of the cytokine release syndrome refractory to steroids induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumabe is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action whereby passive antibody therapy may mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are developing.
Convalescent serum production, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
