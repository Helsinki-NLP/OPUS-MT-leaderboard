A Republican Strategy to Obstacle Obama Reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy because of the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth and states that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what is happening in Canada, the American states are responsible for organizing the federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, a majority of American governments promulgated, from 2009, new laws that made the process of registration or voting difficult.
This phenomenon has spread since the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, those laws reduce the period of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the polling and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit a photographed identity document.
Indiana State was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana law.
As a result, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photographed identity document.
It is important to note that, unlike what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photographic identity documents issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
However, obtaining the required identity document often costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earn less than $35,000 per year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have a photographed identity document.
And there's more.
In many states students, voters who vote most for democratic candidates cannot use the photographed identity document issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote on Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two of three Spanish voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished the registration of voters on the same day of the polling in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to establish a support service for voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the general elections of 2004, election registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that supported the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13 per cent of the voters in the state.
In the case of Hispanics it was exactly the same.
These represent only 11 per cent of the electors, equivalent to 24 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Prosecutor's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed the law requiring the submission of a photographed identity document.
It is undeniable, however, that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, since it is clear that they intend to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that have adopted those laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too soon to confirm with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this regard, measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer detection: Do you test or not do it?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than a reason enough to make men, already reluctant of themselves, doubt whether or not detection tests should be done.
Take the test or not?
We asked for advice from the experts.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a large number of contagions among sample groups, which made it difficult to interpret these data and make strong recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain mortality difference between the patients who had been detected and those who did not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years of age, also showed that there are between 30 and 40 per cent of potential metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Afro-American men have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are painless.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his or her cancer. All possible options should be offered and not necessarily to treat prostate cancers that do not attack life in the long term, in which case an active surveillance of the disease should be chosen.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, as such cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their life.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We have increasingly determined precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing illness
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from the disease.
We believe that if everyone eats well and moves enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would be at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Society against Cancer.
On the other hand, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for other cancers.
It greatly damages people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
A particular hope: 10 years after quit smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is halved.
The Weight
Fat and obesity also favor the occurrence of the disease, according to the CSC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
The power supply
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering from colorectal cancer.
Carcuter products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for its smoked, dried or salted can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
At the moment, however, your investigations are not conclusive.
According to CSC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While a decrease in prostate cancer risk was observed in one of them, another observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about the concerns and family background of each one with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and with reason.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it's not entirely clear that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it is much like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at an important physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still lacking to be completely safe.
In any case, we assume that this is Higgs, since the possibilities of being mistaken seem few, we will see what this is about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because it will end up hurting.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" which consists largely of some of its characteristics.
Physicians classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we meet the good citizens called fermiones, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other hand are the bounties, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories, which is, by the way, extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of whom we will not speak here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate themselves and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, you might stress here, they're not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as an "messageer" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like throwing a stone to a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave is born (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the bosnes "force carriers".
More stable field
It's the same with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it's about another field, the Higgs camp, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were an ice-cold pond in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
That is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN (the great hadron collider is a 27 km circle ring!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept by itself stuck at the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do so have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not have it.
However, what "can you provide" all these investigations?, Mrs Plamondon asks.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to examine the differences between observations and predictions of the MS.
On the other hand, many want to find themselves, for the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that taps certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, as it proposes no explanation of the gravity (ups!) or the dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of such research on our day-to-days is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that it will not have any.
To see: early in the 1960s, laser pioneers in the laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They were interviewing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle already said, who worked in Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first was pressed) in 1962, at the beginning the laser was rather considered a "labour apparatus".
Just imagine...
Moreover, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light picker in 1969 during his optical research.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this catcher now serves as an "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which was worth the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that we never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In his Commission to die in dignity, Quebec had recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume as soon as a bill is prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
The Devoir has tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a breath of two years.
"They had given me five years of life, but I already have seven," he says, made a pass, lying in his bed in the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, to which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused her damage: a huge weakness that prevents her from going to the bathroom alone and even eating by herself.
Sitting in front of an appetite for lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Valent, he even smiles, talks to strangers who give him attention, brings him medication, and offers him a bath.
The bravery of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for the diarrhea to heal, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found remedy for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man does foot standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois Center.
Returning to her childhood, for some, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he observes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of this regression.
All patients entering the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A, 89 years old, is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have some good children," he adds.
"I don't have any more desires left in this life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, one last visit of your son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers are offered body care and food support.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we know we're all gonna end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the central doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When dying, mouthwashs are offered with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, her son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center the days pass without ever being the same.
Alongside a 94-year-old man who savors his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old girl dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who are sick of cancer," Dr. Christiane Martel worries.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadboisarrivant center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem with access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several agencies, such as Victor-Gadbois Center and Grand Montréal's home palliative care society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great relative deficiency in the health care of Quebec that makes many doctors specialized in palliative care support the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate its opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system in Quebec is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," she says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in emergencies suffering great pain without having done what it takes to relieve her.
I'm afraid that patients want to die just because they don't get the right care."
And at the same time, many oncologists are obsessed with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard’s survival hopes were already low when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that she wanted to stop the treatment, she told me she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she said.
"But she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick who claim to die thank their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative home care in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering.
More and more, the un alleviated disease will have the possibility of having such palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want relief."
The implementation of this report has been possible thanks to a Journalism Fellowship from Canada's health research institutes.
Real estate ads in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP entrepreneurs, fund-raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia count, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobists are part of.
An "industry" which came too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It turns out interesting how the system sprays once we've been hunting the big media," ironiza Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into the wrongs associated with road contracts in Quebec, that the liberal prime minister at that time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine funding of parties and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved a billion dollars in contracts", including some of its instincts to stay with a proportional portion.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, while hoping to "show the stratagems that exist behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government interveners, researchers and analysts.
This unit also works with the "Marteau Squadre" cops, who, since 2009, have made Montreal's "Square Card" moderate to inflate contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has registered fraud and corruption charges against municipal offices such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
Reimbursements are suspected in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambim, have been formally accused.
The latter has caused shock in explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the Mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambim distributed money to right and left during the 2000s, granting more than $88,000 from Canada (about €68,000) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal collection of funds for the former Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, explained this perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs affected.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills between 30 and 40 per cent for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of having deliberately looked fat to a parallel budget and filled his dirty money arks.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early in November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected Montreal policies to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, he has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of electoral campaign money was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she ensures that she pulls "out of a thread to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and to catch the culprits".
And he adds that the process is "sorry, but positive."
We're cleaning up the wounds but it would take a clean research unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that doubtful practices don't recur.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is mostly concerned about the role of the 'political elected in the wake of the stratagem'.
Estimate by 70 per cent of the share of dirty money that was destined for the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, ironiza: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to it, "while electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It advocates a complete review of the system of public procurement and party financing: "we can't fall any lower; go to the bottom of things, bravely, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story takes on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look in the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would I explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players have arrived.
Day-to-day advance at your side.
Technical staff have also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't warm up.
From my beginnings in the preformation center of INF Clairefontaine to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always moved forward in bold steps.
It's going to get the benefit of the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to fighting very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He is supported by attachments like Claude Makellele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one the same in League 1 and it is among the best European trainers.
It has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with big players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has removed our leader's position.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our greatest goals is the Champions League: we have ranked for the eighths in style.
What is the aim of the club in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to start with, to finish the first of our league in front of the Port so we can get the round of eighth finals.
Can the PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is being given to its means of implementing this project.
Not winning the drink in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
In the last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a rather better season.
This year I think it'll be good.
Even if the great teams like Marseilles, Lyons and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media are waiting for more than the PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we've won 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still have things to blame for is a little frustrating.
We wonder what more people expect.
We can never earn 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to start a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City which, after two seasons, has not managed to be classified for eighths of the end, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be to neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "impulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up carrying the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We'd better say we have a "Zlatandependence."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he puts many goals.
He's come to prove he's the star of League 1.
And he's shown on all the teams he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect man and player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us to make progress.
How did you experience Eurocopa 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
He was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from amassing game time.
I saw things there and I got strengthened.
Today I manage to play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the "bleus".
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and this is due to our exemplary behavior today.
What view do you have of Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the "bleus"?
He's getting results.
They are well located in the Global Classification Group.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was Laurent Blanc's case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings the selection to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to set the bases?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not lived a similar game in my whole career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a convertible virtual currency to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol to the way BitTorrent allows the exchange of files of the same.
About 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
Bitcoin's contribution, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today to around 10 dollars (quotations are censused on bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other systems with types of virtual coins such as "credit", used to advance in a video game and which can be won by playing or can be bought (and even occasionally swapped).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are both account books depositors, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins changes consist of the public account book, which spreads throughout the network.
The key point is to write that new transaction in that book.
This is due to the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers and the winner, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file-cutting, i.e. transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical print.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before they "twrinkle" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular print (more zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very fast (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer solving the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to 100 million, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network already has its heights.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The judgment used does not affect the same protocol", assures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Initiative in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant basses" were launched.
"$30,000 has been changed," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a teaching book on that coin, believes much in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain in the anonymity.
The system is easy to launch into the trades, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to provide you with a address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", Pierre Noizat needs, which ensures thousands of users.
There is a general movement of review of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to be imposed, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
Furthermore, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if this currency is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished mainly the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former heads of refugees in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the times of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes unite Jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be when westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, was made by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attacks, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His take of control of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the darkness of their peasants overpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old people, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making use of government land to resell them as solars for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I've heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have learned how to take advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65% of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
Those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to be given work.
All, including the armed opposition, are hungry for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish leaflets that present a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstitution of the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, eliminating the position of the prime minister who had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly in view of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no packaging has been fixed or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the sense that Westerners were there to seize them.
No energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the land and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, no mining exploitation.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Aynak's copper mines, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig out the huge Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore their normal relations.
French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a French university department, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "get the hearts and the spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making the aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain localities.
These works, eager to obtain local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increase of crop surfaces.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in those valleys, often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled, and direct civil aid.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily confers full powers on it, he decided to play the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And for almost two years, Egypt has used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial disruptions.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues "treasoning his word" and "strengthening the right".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a step to speed up the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be organized within the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to give up their draft to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview to the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or vote on my text or hold full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, a vast majority of Islamist, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not enforce their views.
Human rights representatives, religious minorities and civil society did likewise.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, substitute members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As was expected, the voting papers were unanimously.
The commentators are grateful, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed virtually at the time of prayer, so that several members of the committee came to think that the timepiece of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of the law, remains the same as that of the Constitution of 1971."
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The Liberals think it is a hypocrisy and they think it is nothing more than an advertising act.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is made through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who must confirm his conformity with Sharia laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not scholars but university students, some of whom are trained in the French system," explains Alexis Bluet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity about article 220, for the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might be raised in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to pronounce themselves above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms concerning the extended powers entrusted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will argue that there are few compared to those during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
As the military wishes, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Civil prosecutions will not be prohibited in military courts, as requested by human rights associations.
These also showed their concerns regarding the text, which they consider to be libertified.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and now insults are banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially in the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, reports Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to go out last night on television, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state manifested themselves on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the shadow of the world and a sea of salmon
The promised Earth combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
"AFI" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
Anyone who enters this "baptismal pillar" is thought to receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: turning water into wine into a wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm, and the nets filled with water.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers use here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Vía Dolorosa").
It begins in the fortress of Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial was held, and continues along the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Unction and the burial place of Jesus.
In this very place is also the symbolic Christian Obbligus of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will later become reality.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what was left of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And reaching there by their own means, they can only those who dedicate themselves to climbing.
The others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermón, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
Until there, bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On one trip you won't be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Rollos of Qumran, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his painting exhibition he has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bathroom museum, which are some old Turkish bathrooms with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesare it is worth passing through the exclusive Ralli private museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
The entrance is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Memorial of Children, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives are ringing.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they swim even in the winter months, as the temperature of the water does not fall to 21 degrees and the air is warmed up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that can easily hold up to those who can’t swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People arrive here to pass treatment courses with salt water, salmura and curative muds and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to order their nervous breakdowns.
Touching the Mysteries of Old Age
It preserves the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It passed the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, this was where Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he took a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk along the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "mix" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find new married couples coming from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph yourself.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusades.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists Remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30 per cent of the people speak Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to hectics (currently $1-3,8 hectics).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there are fast trams and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the City Baja with the City High.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transhipping for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated.
From Friday night to Saturday's sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There we offer a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, variety of sauces, the falafel, which are balls of soft garbanzo, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no street dogs.
On the other hand, there are many well-nourished cats who "pass their taste" imposingly.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the cars parked.
The rodents love the crowded places and do not reject the golosins.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Besides insurance, it goes for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will take you for 15 hectics a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who arrived to travel to the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, a figure that exceeds 51 per cent at the same rate as in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: Immigrants Save for Language
While members and human rights defenders discuss the implications of the law on compulsory review, they have already appeared in the country of bullies trading with "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December a law enters into force, according to which each labour immigrant must carry out an examination to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community services institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, in time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will be mandatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it will not be sufficient to give up the examination of the language, if not also the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language knowledge must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of countries where Russian is the official language are the exception.
The persons who obtained their diplomas and education certificates before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and protection of rights
The network of examiners will function under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be tested in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centres are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the State Duma Members and the Federal Immigration Service.
But the rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask this question to the press: And what will this really contribute?
What changes will the obligatoryness of language knowledge, for both Russians and immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from “work slavery”.
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labour migrants, explains Víctor Sebelev, chief of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before its departure.
Only a system of organised selection will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
Immigrants have problems without professions, education, those who don't know the language or go through medical checkups.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, with the pretext of helping, put a "paid trip" to a creepy and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise them one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the wages promised," confirmed the head of the labour immigration department of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be angry, boss!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country they want to go to, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, because they don't talk anymore about dressing them, kicking them and buying them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work on their first chance.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as language law is concerned, rights defenders point to an important point.
The examinations will be carried out only for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbid the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in bureaucratic obstacles and language difficulties in itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred roubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered, and there are cases of extortion.
"They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," said the journalists, the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
"Come on, don't be silly, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was revealed that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed on standard colour printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, seeking to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand roubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker 3,000 rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, converge government officials and rights defenders.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not have successfully passed the first time to study the basic language course.
Furthermore, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with recorded weapons is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons of civil use.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: Shooting shots during weddings where fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow's lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which the Shooting of seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for licensing to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the arms possession law would be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
In the network an open letter has appeared, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "rigurosity without sense" be abandoned.
The percentage of vandalism with recorded weapons is minimal, commented at the service of BBC news from Russia, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed during the six months of 2012 with the use of firearms recorded in internal organs, compared with a total of 1168 offences recorded for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the civil-use weapons sector will not be a drawback for the criminal to be addressed to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at low prices.
In the meantime, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says the retired colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the High General State.
Screenshot of the website that accepts arms requests
The first one, "investigation of the army or military," that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officials and the same Caucasians," Baranets says.
The following type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police warehouses and stolen weapons directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are being sold from military arsenals.
There were often explosions in many military arsenals.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the lack," says one ex-military.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sandstone.
"They have now proliferated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute arms under the rope to the black market, including that of Moscow," says the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
Lots of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," he explains.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose topic revolves around arms.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the weapons on the black market have arrived there "on account of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places where armed conflict occurs, 14 per cent of cases are stolen during weapons production and 5 per cent are "illegal archaeology".
The dependent of one of the arms stores, which asked for their name not to be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers turn to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some port, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This brings the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan needs to be fulfilled, they make test purchases to illegal arms traders," he adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed to me went to the "Begovaya" platform, where he would be a man who would take me to a "squinita" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the weapon, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend to have contacts," says the store's dependent. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there also has to be arrived, let's say "from Mr. Ivanovich, who asked him to tell him that a tooth had fallen from his daughter."
I can even get a couple of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I'm not going to blow him up.
The beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former Military Viktor Baranets tested the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when an article on this subject was available.
Schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They handed him a photo album where there was no "all."
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," he recalls.
To the buyer, according to Baranets' words, they don't offer cat for hare: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential client, not only buy; let's go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the weapon fires well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa Shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
For this, no personal documents or meetings are required.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertising notice "Buying a gun or a machine gun."
There users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Iván" (conserved spelling).
"I bought a TT. Moscow gun," he laconically posed his question "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-hand captures to those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the onion, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: usually, the website is registered out of the reach of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions for you to know where the weapon is hidden," reports the NGO press secretary "The Right to Arms", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one is left without a gun and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-hand captures to those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the onion, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov per $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO “The Right to Arms”, a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half will have to be expected.
It is sent from the military warehouses by the middle-ranking chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, which constitutes 22.900, and the number of cases identified as theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the United States are put on strike.
Even a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has begun in the United States at Walmart Corporation supermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and to graze in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the aim of the protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after the Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States, the pride of casualties that captured millions of people, and that was sometimes accompanied by confrontations.
That day, some Walmart corporation workers, who employs 2.2 million people in the world, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside trade unions and left-wing activists in the corporate stores, whose products are directed to people with modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and supply of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because he pays little to his workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of mountings or hand scanners.
This "Black Friday" event participants demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists from California University in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 an hour, this will cost the $3.2 billion corporation.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart places the pay increase on the shoulders of consumers, every visit to the store will result only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters are pleased that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" extended in its shops from Thursday 8 in the afternoon until midnight the following day and during that time Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, its register boxes carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview to the left-wing Huffington Post website, that they left their job "less than five" employees from Walmart and that the protest had only been "another public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
Free box!
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the objectives were not precisely Walmart stores (which in this progressive city they are not appreciated, and for that reason there is no one for now), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and don't pay for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
Nobody earns less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, to me it's incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of the American teenagers went through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the showers, in part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few viewed this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly run into some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal magazine forum there is a comment that the author says it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast food cashiers and cooks start paying for at least $15 per hour, i.e., that their current minimum wage be doubled.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing the activists of the union movement with sarcas and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main features is excessive rotation of staff.
Distinguished
Noiseful protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in half the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians participated, in particular the member of the Jumaane Williams City Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then not even giving you a hospital or paying you for your honest work."
The protesters received the support of other prominent Democrats in New York, such as the candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers in the fast food sector to get fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves."
As described in the New York Times, this has been the biggest manifestation of this type in American fast food history.
But in it only a few hundred people participated, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people in New York worked.
It is still unclear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy"
The theme of increased reality, so popular among lovers of modern technologies, is recently normally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Early in the summer, at its annual Google conference, it showed a moving model and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Cambridge Microsoft laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it was clarified that for the scientists of that company, glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are drawn to the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of your research group's study?
- We dedicate ourselves to the person-computer interaction, but we also try to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with your finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What about the future?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional viewing systems, based on different technologies, including design.
We must free the world from computer science to ours, to ours, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you can't be considered a panacea, you're still waiting to resolve the issue of privacy, because you don't always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of computer interaction are good, but each one in his own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda can?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- Usually I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, do you want to force users to adapt to what they can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Are you missing resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
I mean, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Also important is speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps movements are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that modern serial-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects man-machine interaction.
To me it would be very useful for my work to be an equivalent of such a device, but not to require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And you don't have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "camera", one of which is in fact the infrared transmitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible slide.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
On the contrary, increase and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a Kinect flexible analog, play with the camera's location curvature and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- So I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of enhanced reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up an intelligent phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smart phone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (private things you will only see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics usually point out: there is no tactile response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that the increased reality is the seventh break in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the octave could well be adding touch sensations.
In the meantime, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly designed to bring tangibleness to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone is blowing it in the yolks of his fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Do you make him think he feels what it seems he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that it goes to an open space, almost endlessly. We are also working on the idea of belts to run (not like gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, cheating the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That's what attracts work with virtual reality for researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Personal subjective taste in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even having Russia know them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, to whom you can find near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophosophos of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg's avant-garde in the late 80's - early 90's.
Moreover, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city wakes up in the smiling inhabitants and lifts all the mood.
Recently, he took into his hands an organ and became the organizer of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, because of his existence bohemia, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray arouses aggressiveness and agitation of properties that are not good.
But my provocations are meant to start a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my works were displayed.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free ones like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists from the new wave, with those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who took "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was over.
I went to the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... it was important for me to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the Bohemia of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Names, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "The Van Gogh Ear."
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under a phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an entertainer of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regular customers.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man to whom truth, honesty and culture of the past century are liked.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something in your work that can be recognized.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in which the current and the occurrence are clearly expressed.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
The clowns are a time category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like this is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns everything is taken care of and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change in clothing.
Now one is followed by clothing, oriented on the outside, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person doesn't even have to give his hand, but spit on his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
A cultured city must have such a hero.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but can commercial art be beautiful at best?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
People used to gather in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simplones others.
Now they've all been divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think who you want to like.
Now, every hero of worship has its 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov arrive for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones. The sex-social sphere works there.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything fades.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to lose what you've achieved.
When he was young, he made such pictures that a collector had hanging them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now concepts are often confused.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denied money just to paint pictures.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: official of culture.
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When kings were right, everything was otherwise, kings might not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are now very good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level who properly evaluate them and open the way for them.
It is now flourishing subjective personal taste.
The same is true, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There is much more culture in Moscow, there is land.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is minimal.
We have to make art look fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a Saint Petersburg grant.
Give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board start in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve mankind, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of ingravity or on the same planet of spare?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the chief investigator of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on Venus' surface the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at great altitudes or in Venus' orbit... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with flora began to be addressed.
Experiments with plants have been conducted for half a century.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the insect breeding in orbit, small fruit flies, the drosofles.
In 1979, they sent them to the codorniz egg space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of ingravity.
We get a normal pollination as a result.
But then trouble starts.
"The problem is that this chicken has to find support, it must stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they didn't find support, the chicks turned upside down at random.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the birds in space.
The last time a biological "minarca" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only travel same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats, who were sent to space already with fetuses.
At first, nothing was found supernatural.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had descendants.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, when losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a proper emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our flying gaviette, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," comments the veteran of the Vakhtang Vachnadze aerospace sector.
In June 1964, only after one year of the flight to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a child.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are told who after long flights everything has worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, Russian hero, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the cosmonaut preparation centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
Under null floating conditions, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates ingravity.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, yet hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its native element.
The small amphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is found about 9 months inside its mother in the amniotic fluid, since it will be easier to get used to water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if ingravity is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation is necessary, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy the abdominal and pelvis muscles are decrepitated very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, let's skip that, trusting in the action of childbirth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth to a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear with a special suit for training, such as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we're going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will give rise to us bringing to Earth a disabled person, to a totally inappropriate person," says the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
In time, however, this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships turn to a distant planet that will be home to their children born into space.
Chief of NKú: The inspection of the system "švarc" has not given to the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application is slowing down.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (NKU) says in an interview with Aksuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," he describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of a wrong practice, he mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, known as the "švarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Cyvic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So, is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks or to demand obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the control committee at the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the common project between the Czech and German team, in which the legislation on public procurement was compared in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started to perform about two years ago.
This is simplified: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, this follows the legislation in force in each country and then practices in itself.
We have united everything and, although the control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "more stricter and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but rather to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually do? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely a common control of this kind could help us to stop investing our efforts in creating laws, reducing and improving the limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of saving means getting something right at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long term, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the award limit means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paper", that those who want to search for system failures can do it more easily than if the limits remain as high as now.
You speak of the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office like our NKU or is it organized otherwise?
In how many offices, such as the NKÚ, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a college too, the only thing is that in your case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also to some extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this aspect it is slightly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled at the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to draw up a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be accurately specified in what is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of the inspectors?
That sure doesn't, but, I repeat, I don't like making these kind of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, you wouldn't be getting any benefit from working with our office, would you?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean for your Office? Is it in any way apparent its impact?
Taking into account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been stated in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out checks ex post, there must be a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have initiated a new tool for "non-economic risk detection", which we have made public tenders to pass almost 14,000, which have been analysed.The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process and similar.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be beneficial or rather misleading for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope it will be.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "strengthened" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under the previous regulations, the persons in charge were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and each law not respected in the field of public procurement meant violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law this way?
I don't think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and do not punish those who commit a formal judgement, which has no impact on decision making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this road leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the prime minister of government can prevent the performance of the Office that has an obligation to carry out such checks and to demand obligations.
You can say, "Let us change the law and allow it," but you can't say that we will do nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how to act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
On the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct, which is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Roads have ice plates, although they are mostly transitible
In a number of places in the Czech Republic, roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are transitible, caution should be extreme in some areas.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitible, but they presented ice and snowboards.
The temperature falls and will fluctuate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lower areas the snow layer is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Metal Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to the information of the road traffic control centre in the region.
The R6 and the first-class road in the region are now accessible without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface can be frozen and rebaladed.
In addition, all second- and third-class routes, including mountain roads, can also be transited.
However, in some of them there are still pieces of ice and overcrowded snow.
Greater attention is needed on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Pardubice Region and Hradec Králové
On some roads in East Bohemia there is a danger of freezing and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have been formed on the roads, reports the Road and Highways Directorate on their pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice plates forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice cream can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and above all on the second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains of Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a heavy snow layer in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemia area, today the sky will be between clear and partially clouded, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually fluctuate between three low zeros and one positive degree, and a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are transitible today in the morning, although caution will have to be extreme and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the first hours of the morning there will be ice, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent decline in temperatures, some tracks may also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will meet with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what is revealed by the information of the road traffic control centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is transitible almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to extend the precaution, especially on the way between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The surface of most of the first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the Pilsen and Tachov border road area with Germany there may be sections with ice plates.
The second and third category routes are wet, so in this case it is also warned of iceboard sections.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the least transit routes in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially empty snow.
After chemical treatment, it was still snowing in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road workers removed snow during the night; on the Šumper road about three centimeters of snow were accumulated, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transitible without restrictions.
"In the tallest areas of the Šumper road, there are remains of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with medium-dew snow in the direction of Jeseník", confirmed today an operator of the Šumper road administration to the ČTK.
On the ground and at night they also went to Jesenická and, after chemical treatment, the slopes of the highest areas are now cleared and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are transitible without restriction, in Šternská the drivers should drive with caution on the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported on complications in different stages at first thing in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures are kept under zero, even in the lowest areas, so the ice and snow obviously remain on the pavement. Instead, in the lowest areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
There have been no complications of service for the mint.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day, rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be cleared and there will be ice.
From the general roads, unfavourable conditions have been announced on road I/13, on the border between the Ústí nad Labem and Liberec region.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Hornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just less than a month, the end of the world will come, how do you feel about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to hold on to.
To the music group The Tap Tap we rather like to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organized a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-wide charity we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the May calendar set out for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December at 21 p.m., we will hold 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, along with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, canceled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear at beneficial concerts?
Of course, and it'll be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time at the three concerts.
The hymns will be linked together simultaneously thanks to the live special broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the videoclip, where also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial events and concerts...
We put all our efforts to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested in and have fun working with us.
What will the money collected in the concerts against the end of the world be allocated to?
Equipment for the education centre without barriers Studeo, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with civil Tap association in Jedličk.v ustav.
The students at the Jedličk austav school regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they engage in fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličk'v ustav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert several groups and interpreters work.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbian, Illustosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will act.
For more detailed information, please consult www.kpks.cz.
Did you have any other "showing" similar action in the future?
In May we will act for the first time at the Pražské Jaro festival, so we will surely prepare here an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as hard as it might seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which always surprises me.
Even in Moscow, where we came back recently, everything went out smoothly.
Thanks to the outflows abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is much way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still no frequent movement by a person alone around the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in wheelchairs in elevators, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been created to work towards addressing the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what ways should we take the example of the most advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we're going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with serious disabilities move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever you want...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap let's go a little ahead!
A respectful society or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes when prominent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will begin to change everything.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a great strength of will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered Jedličk'v, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And over time, as our moderator La Â Â Â Â Angelovič says, he left us a little bit of hands (Laughter).
However, popularity has not come up until recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that it helped us greatly to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the European Union's assistance, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
You meant to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that something else can be done.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in his own way, that all new things are welcomed with caution and it takes a long time to accept them.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and those we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well with people with disabilities, then it is not just a step forward for them, but for the whole society.
Did you help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe it?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be rigorous in many respects and demand a certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go for two days to practice, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: La Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever wants and wants will always find the doors open.
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena de Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through video conferencing to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO educational centre without barriers in Jedličk av ustav of Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry in the pre-sale option in Bohemiahticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency countries last week Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member of ESA of the former Eastern Europe bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during later years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, the path of Poland towards the cosmos started much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the participants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won in France the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was put on one of the craters of the moon's hidden face.
Already in 1925 a dresin was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known, nor are the project ' s highlights known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the drainage or for its braking.
Information about this Dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
Based on the retained material, it is clear that the investigation reached the stage of the practical evidence.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committeee Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all draft missile techniques for military use and coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemmy, reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, the creation of a society that would devote itself to cosmonautics was proposed.
Artificial satellite projects had already been launched at that time and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) had aspired to become a member of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that year, the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He disembarked this post until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm long and did not reach 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 the two-stage RM-2 rocket air tests started in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have an peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first rockets of the RM type was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from one another by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km of height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was later built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the research into cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the social labour law is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the law social unrest.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less regulatory competition.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of the large differences in labour costs (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so "proves a drop" of the competitor's price in order to become more market-oriented and thus to increase its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility, and thus it is also not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, it necessarily increases the state's social spending.
This whole situation fosters the total uninterest of tax-paying entrepreneurs and compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused in their pursuit of benefits.
The situation is so universally known that there is no need to present specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create situations, in certain economies, in which the Governments of those countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without regard to social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the private capital dictation, especially in respect of wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees in respect of labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between poor and rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is now about one million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly common case: people employed with such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German Federal Parliament was made public.
The savings measures of almost all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation: people, pressured by a weak social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to suffer a serious wage on the limit of society, hoping that one day it will reach the private investor capital country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, poverty then moves from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African continue to work for a small part of a European wage.
This also affects all Latin America.
The liberal theories and the media affirm to the satisfaction that the state should not bring capital to the economy, which leads the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by entering control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its selfishness in the political march and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in the very powerful and omnipresent practice, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
The situation in Germany is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is adopted later in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as is announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
Clearly, liberally oriented democracies quickly find themselves in a situation such as that described by Appianos in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in the times of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had been disintegrating and the administrations occupied force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegally and helps to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unhindered and people came to the polls with the precipitated vote... "there were no people with character who aspired to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "He began to speak seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appianos thought of Pompeya, Caesar went up to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in ancient times, is that today's society is based on unconsidered preferences of the individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as that of then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of Fascist and Communist regimes should therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With regard to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next blow.
The real demolition is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian disasters we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in the ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international and within the EU, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and which weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (Nothing of violence comes up and nothing could do it), Sting in his song Fragile and whose stribillo prays "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (we don't forget how fragile we are).
"If my children didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, various reactions have arisen.
One, on the Israeli side, argues in favour of the right to self-defence and encapsulates the Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and argues racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and puts a stop to Israel of a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated regularly and who is the victim; after all, the citizens of today's Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who benefits from the tensions that have been dragged for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions to which I have come on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind the history of struggles for power is in the front row.
At every time we can find a great Alejandro or Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or whether there was someone behind his throne who directed his actions towards a certain objective.
We must accept that we live at a time that concentrates the wealth of the world on the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
It is not written very close to them.
Of course.
In the 90s of the 19th century, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which always meant strengthening for them.
They have important participations in almost all the world's central banks and in those countries where they are not represented, have declared or are preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan they were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq they were 5, after the overthrow of Gadafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschilds, began during the War of Secession to print money and was killed in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
His desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second war wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third war was intended to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (like slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not consume so much resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary project for such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, operates follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and they always lead to a worsening of the situation. Otherwise, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, they destroyed the zarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War suddenly ended and unjustified from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end the Czarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the land of the Second World War, the bankers and politicians were allowed to create, in a covert way, a conflict in the wake of the massive war repairs imposed on Germany, thereby creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough for the Germans to serve the Führer solution, which was strong enough and simple and pointed out to the culprits, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority to represent and represent so well the role of the fifth column, which caught the flame and caused the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is hard to know if Hitler pulled too much of the rope that international bankers had tied it to in the beginning or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the best conditions for accepting the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way in which the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If the international bankers were able to start it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now along with the Arab population or generally Muslim in the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also internationally. Let us take as an example how Israeli sympathizers and detractors are divided in a manner.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at first there was the greed of some individuals and their hunger for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their representatives, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Ormuz Strait, by which it passes 20% of all world oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light is now shown the words that David Rockefeller delivered in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls all of his beings.
"And it obliges all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark in the right hand or in the front, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand this: whoever has two fingers in front, to add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is sixty-six."
Argo Film: If You Get Raw, Call Hollywood · Global Voices
In November 1979 a group of Islamist students took up the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned shah Mohamed Reza Páhlevi, who fled after the revolution to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation offered no positive prospects: throwing the shah off the edge could not be allowed, since, if it did, it jeopardized the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified further with the failed attempt to release hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the U.S., its destiny caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran made a decisive contribution to Jimmy Carter's defeat in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck discusses an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before taking over the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated periple, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helping an extravagant story: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Gender combination
The plan by the expert on "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized journals, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film the moods are combined. On the one hand we find well documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits, emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were shown in the same way in the film, do not differ much in this respect.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And besides, scenes from the CIA's central and other institutions: brought men who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the office halls, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectful director and his way of doing things has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is its third feature film, after "Friendly Small, Adieux" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film in which action has no place in the city of Boston, where it grew up.
The sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was also a characteristic that placed old film directors above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran is "flyed" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy is impressive because of its synoptic capacity that at the same time conveys the excitement of the confusion and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the imposter team at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And they are quite well arranged. Sometimes something adds to reality: here it doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene where the crisis is happening at Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America and the unbridled search after its track becomes crazy).
The weakness of Argo is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be continued with a moderate interest, to appreciate its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70's.
But if it breaks down, that'll be hard.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services can be, is sufficient.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually presents a survey of the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It happened to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in leadership positions in large European companies," explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the nominal absurdities, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women had better prices in life insurance because they were objectively at a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
Among the EU’s controversial regulations are, for example, the binding addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, damage the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers of all life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the thin guideline the size of the chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual prohibition of the use of the term "untlement" or the withdrawal of the classic commercial bulb has been criticised.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often takes this type of decision under the pressure of one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that high-quality bananas in the EU should have a length of at least 14 centimeters and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission argued that this only seeks to harmonise non-homogenised national standards so far, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive leads to a waste of food.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU prescription last year that inflatable balloons on the market it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without an adult's supervision.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction also applies to the use of maasuegras by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are even born in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, one should speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laisez Fairi, appointed, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then surpassed, for example, the volume established for preserved mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fines.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that have no access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application of grants.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because of not having sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that there was a lot of grain in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from sea ports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries without access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). In particular, it is intended to draft applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
Member States' guidelines are often a target of criticism, EU regulatory efforts, and more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to a number of experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that the Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
Czechs are also affected by sensitive fiber, just as other countries in the Union are fighting for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious of these battles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc's request, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became known as "tuzemák".
Only products produced from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected EU designations of origin, together with known feta and gorgonzola cheeses worldwide, the mazapan of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, there are already, for example, the Karlovy Vary cookies, the Pohořelice and Třeboň carp, and even the variety of hops of Žatec.
As EU-protected maras, they can be proud of Pardubice's ginger bread and Hořice v Podkrkonoší's boats.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
Senator, how did it happen to be presented to the presidential elections?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't apply.
But I can no longer bear to see how it is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves get unpunished, taxes and retirement age increase.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to make a solution to change it.
And since I'm already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter it has set itself on its way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I needed that if I was elected Senator, I would present my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and as much mandate as possible.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that criticizes at the bar or in front of television, but that we trample anyone who wants to start a change.
To this is added the media, which despises you and confuses the freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I'm told I've bribed journalists what I've been a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents itself to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over twenty million.
To do so must change the law.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobbying group for the leadership to be recognized as self-reliant work, and we have succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, either right or left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential for the support of all parliamentary groups.
With no match or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be a man of right or left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me, whether it's a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we go ahead.
I don't care if someone's right-wing or left-wing, I want to join people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
He jokes about you being populist.
But you're not proving it by what you say?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or known experts speak of them.
But without the support of the parliament, you only have orders.
And with this he cannot survive in long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you address and talk to people, you will, for example, obtain criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character who points to the disputes, you can press the political scene.
Let us take the direct election of the President, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say I'm just a fan, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I've just started with politics and I'm trying to get as much support as possible for my programme.
I'm trying to move things forward myself, but in case it doesn't work out well, I'll leave it in six years and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that with someone I don't do anything, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they'd better encourage themselves to apply for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought out the frauds with light heating oils.
I came up on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did so voted on the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it because I don't have time for it, to check the blameless past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have any money.
I don't have any money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
Don't you have any money?
Speaking of property statements, how is yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have an estimated land of 25 million, a valued floor ten million, another floor taxed at eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of 10 million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, was fighting against evil and injustice.
Does Aston Martin drive, his property is worth 60 million and he doesn't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to owe myself?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that there is not too much interest in my programme.
And I don't have an obligation to pay for the campaign with money from my pocket.
The campaign's expenses are essentially covered by what I will receive as Senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 krona a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run as a candidate.
So will you continue your business to live?
Didn't you say before you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, in part I left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring.
People would want me to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as a businessman?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I'm still winning.
If I were president, then I'd leave the business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently finished "bookmountain" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and at last there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company near the library, says: "the building is also beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one likes to go to those old fashion libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, bears the dubious honor of having stood up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute somehow to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented on euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that is how political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a whole master in the art of bar charts and responsible for fun buildings in pairs that cynics, took the theme with his usual serenity and came to the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked at him and he shrugged his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellows:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, the so-called `Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises at the expected location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is complemented by underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and residential buildings.
In early November, the book mountain was awarded with the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town lacking history, which to date had nothing but to offer a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intrude a dairy center, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in his history.
The Long Path to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese cellar.
It is true that there is an elevator that carries us right to the center of this massive mountain, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but rather melt with their topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully crystallized interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor covered and the elegant lighthouses unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
Upstairs you can see the park banks, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that usually is uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is we put feet up the classic space configuration and pull the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well taken advantage of: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves black shelves that assume the functions of wall coating, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that is how one day, on a Frisian farm, we met the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and in the Netherlands fields, a plastic fabric of few millimetres of thickness has been used as a base for subjecting the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library, this fabric was first taken in such quantities, until four centimeter thick plates were obtained.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells of a new car mix and sport slipper.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the café you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy delicious Dutch croquettes and their figus planted in huge macetas.
These create a pleasant environment to the pair that maintains atmospheric humidity suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
"Although it is difficult to believe it given its large crystal-cleared surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," Trouborst says.
The required heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is situated under a huge crystal pyramid, even in the most sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside it.
The huge wooden fences situated cross-sectionally on the glass façade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is the automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Also, Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "late soul".
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to give a book of their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete file; at present it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has closed down.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than an empty middle library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain connection with this building.
Everyone knows his book is part of the library.
Although he's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved all success in this discipline reigns that in the specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uncultivated he may be.
Finally, a point of departure to conform to your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the observer status of the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, that's right.
This is because he is currently reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not accustomed to doing so.
I think they're still testing what their role will be, but they've already started the road to a "normal" foreign policy.
A similar foreign policy to countries such as France or Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, stands ready to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the United Nations vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Near East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why it must be careful and not alienate from Arab public opinion or Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give him that much importance, since it's not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by refraining from voting in important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think that there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with this Germany has achieved a certain amount of respect.
After all, all this has done is show that it is a country to which they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. internal policy.
I think the Obama government is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend this position.
I believe that the true disparity of views does not really have the extent to which it is attributed.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations it has with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a superior entity, but they must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in future Germany will play a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it has with Israel.
This has always been a very dangerous subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really wish to assume a leading role?
Or might it still be hard for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not become used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it continues to be difficult to play a more important role.
If we look at the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that every time Germany takes its position as a leading actor, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
Given this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
U.S. influence on European policy is decreasing ever more, but the EU is not currently covering that gap, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a more leading role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant to them or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, it's life!

"Market protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-famous brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name, a name officially registered in China is hidden but has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eposiums do not present a demand.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer from the law firm Taylor Wessing who specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports goods in Puma.
Pattloch opens an archiver in which he keeps seats from the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in that of copying and violating intellectual property rights is still known.
In large cities there are large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. In charge of its clients, he fights the fact that the trademark office officially gives Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pa" or a companion brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes water, the monopoly position disappears, and the damage the image suffers is huge."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year China is, in size, the third luxury goods market and the one that grows at a higher rate.
However, making the registration of dubious legal registrations in the trademark register is complicated and it also takes a lot of money.
Processes can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a suit because it had been so long since the name of the suit had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff is in bad luck, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarism because the process has damaged the China brand," Pattloch says.
This is sometimes the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphics.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a complaint against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
So to this day, the Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
The buyer of Volvo, Geely, used at first a white and blue logo that largely reminded BMW; the matter was settled in the courts and Geely had to modify it.
The manufacturer of Lacoste clothes lost in China against imitationrs from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 there have been difficulties in the lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the job emergency situation returned to normal."
Thus, the number of unprocessed claims has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain outstanding.
Fighting this cost a lot of money.
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China is leading the list of new inscriptions worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, as noted by the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which amounts to a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011 the payment of 1.8 billion yuan for rights would have been made.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs EUR 1.280 or EUR 160.
Fighting against this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese copyist.
Although the Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the impersonator has managed to ensure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have provoked this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," said Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also dismissed the use of the municipalities.
In the following two instances, Freudenberg has been given the reason, but the opposite is still fighting today.
We need to be very careful.
The case has now reached the gates of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending.
Wentzler was confident that the issue could be resolved favourably and praised the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite part a "sum of six figures in euro" in order to reach a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
"This demonstrates how much we care," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten Europe,
specifically if copyists there ensure rights on unprotected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since abandoned this trade area, but it has been able to prevent registration.
"We must be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and counsel Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious in doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what needs to be done is "to record in China everything that can be susceptible to protection," as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposite part license rights by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would expel us from the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a link that can overcome much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin to slowly raise the voices of the singers (contalt, low, tenor and soprano), rowing, becoming numb and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out almost of his boxes by trying to get his strong, soft gestures sorted out.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the choir Imbongi ensays a new song.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years old have also arrived from the human geneticist to the home master.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorus voice has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS programme worldwide has approximately 34 million people infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already seropositive.
The Voices for Africa association has found in Germany godfathers for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can equip a child.
This contribution will cover the school registration, the uniform and will guarantee you a hot daily meal at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in zulu "narrator of stories" or "panegirist".
In this room no one can speak this Bantu language fluently, but sing they do know.
For ten years this choir has been practicing songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: the South of Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers straight from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a people called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the people in Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with something over thirty years has become a habit.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this reconnaissance population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but mainly food, clothing and training.
Without a school title, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first, it was only the special commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which since then has professionally taken care of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial TSEs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Laddillas and sarna are among TSEs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more often given in men who have sexual intercourse with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, tricomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis, and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are reported in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
There were approximately 2,700 cases in 2011.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urination disorders, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore they are not detected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer protection to one hundred per cent.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if it is frequently changed as a sex partner.
If diagnosed early, most TSEs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, from the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
"We have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a woman with self-confidence and leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care of the orphans to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandparents.
The "gogogoes", as is called the older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where to live and care for children to go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook daily for over 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, has built two chickens and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has achieved that many of the people have experienced HIV testing.
This is not obvious, since, despite the patent that this disease is throughout the country, it is not often openly spoken of.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, king Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and filled with excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficially accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless timers who travel across the country and take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin contact against skin."
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years across South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost extreme of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent environment and much joy, but has also managed to rip a couple of tears to some that other angry border soldier.
The journey always takes you to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children of the Aparinas.
Although this small population only appears on the maps, in the Ezulweni River Valley is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines," says the people of the place.
And after walking around the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the practice rooms of Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see shine its light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Although it is the nearest planet to the sun, there is also ice water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It looks like this one has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water is presumably derived from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that in their day were collapsing against Mercury.
No one connects the finding of ice with the possibility that there is life on the planet, states the chief investigator of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can be up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other life components have come to other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which countless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "reborn" stars.
This region of star formation, called in a romantic way by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This sunlit image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits into its extinction process.
In the huge Trifida Nebula, at 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation area.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known as "Las Seven Sisters", are a visible object with a simple view in the night sky.
With the telescope, however, the colors can be better appreciated.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this image of infrared.
It is located 700 light years from the Acuario constellation.
His similarity with a land continent has validated him by the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular coloring.
This black star could be captured throughout its splendour for the first time by the Spitzer telescope infrared detectors.
Saturn and his rings: how they originated remains one of the great incognites of astronomy.
It's probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without leaving track 4,500 million years ago.
One of the biggest and most sharp photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Galaxia del Remolino.
Depending on the tones, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the European Austral Observatory shows the Trifide Nebula located several thousand light years in the constellation Sagittario.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), as dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this star formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiucus, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: at 400 million light years of the Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of fusion are balanced towards each other to end up crashing irremediatablely.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it as the nickname of Southern Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cefeo.
The cloud at 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles about 10 to 100 times smaller than the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located at 430 million light years of Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest young star group of our Milky Way.
This star formation area is constantly producing new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roset Nebula, there are also continuously new stars; at 5,000 light years of the Earth.
In this galaxy so brilliant with a small black hole there is not yet dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found mostly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei would use it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Canaries Telescope located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The disadvantage of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of Arecibo Radiotelescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signs.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "External Intelligence Search" (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer by providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here rises the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror shall cover 42 metres and shall consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a 30-meter mirror diameter.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hands of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he sends images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidates for planets had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched into space on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers start from the basis that there is ice in the south pole of Mercury as well.
However, there is no evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have been pointing to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first that orbits around Mercury, now scientists are sure it is.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years

In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach Bible ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The trip through the Talysh mountain region could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus is progressing with great strain through the sinuous road that passes next to forested hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are located in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people of whom we don't know much, except that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Azeri and are very long.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city boasts a perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit entirely into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometres that separate both urban cores, it takes eight hours because the road is one way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to Caspian oil has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what he needs to have to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva indicates a black and white image.
This is my grandfather who lived for 120 years.
One of his sons died at the age of 136
However, the indisputable star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we consider that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"Born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children. It seems that he still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
So was Şerali Müslümov wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil record.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azeri Tourist Guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of talyshi.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause resides in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the food rich in the calories of talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially all the dairy products and many of which, besides, drink daily a glass of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, he is relatively young for what is spread through these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, he moves tirelessly a huge tin of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s children and one of Mirzayeva’s daughters, both became grandparents long ago.
They also play two small children on one side.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in typical glasses with a flat shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long braids of dark red hair that his son finds us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never fallen down and kept its color.
"I've never used any shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been shopping at a supermarket all my life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the period after World War II.
However, everything came back to his prank when the "beloved father," Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult professing to the paternal figure of the nation, which runs its country as a dictator, knows no limits.
It remained in power until 2003, when the witness handed over to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euro) as monthly pension, a quantity with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son is right: "in our culture the older are highly respected."
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't good enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is merged.
The future constitution, with the sharia as a base, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in patetism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that this happens is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to Christian Coptics, liberals, illustrated Muslims and seculars.
All of them, immersed so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile because of the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand its "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD degree awarded by the University of South California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
Indeed, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean as "principles"?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre it has in place, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what suggests a new article added: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power throughout Sunni Islamism.
It does not have to be that way, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh repression of the opposition.
Up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons after the dictator's fall.
As set out in the draft, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morale and its values".
This is so inaccurate in legal terms that with the help of this article State institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, this is nothing but censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, it forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacy.
However, it is unclear what an offense is and how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits "injury to people"
Is a President's caricature enough or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for his signature and that, according to, his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks, the opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday at Tahrir del Cario Square and swore to fail the Act before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end in defeat," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who holds third place in the lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the bucket of the garbage of history".
Through Twitter he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a "state gang against democracy".
"When the referendum is called, we will go to your palace and overthrow it," says opponent Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been purified," was cited in the Egyptian media as opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-manifestation; in case of fact not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the salafists took part in the same in the cry of: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Morsi to "clean up the country," while proclaiming: "The Qur'an is our constitution".
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, Morsi's supporters did not want to risk such a thing.
The Muslim brothers stated that both those who opposed the draft of the constitution and those who supported it would have expressed their views loud and clear.
The time would now have come for the people to decide which direction the country should follow in the polls.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed by the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were in prison or had to face a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution," laments in a conversation with the newspaper 'Welt am Sonntag'.
The expansion of Morsi's powers to the three powers of the State resulted in the resignation of this lawyer.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Rather than strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it," says Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protestant in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the world's most illustrious fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible for the country's success to have any connection to its greed for a very ill-frozen fish?
Take a series of overly cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothing.
Leave him there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisites.
I'm in the little town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is a salazon trout that lets itself freeze in water during, depending on how bad you prefer it, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, the Norwegians come to a festival here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this meal of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"It eats raw and then drinks a glass of aquavit from a drink," says Harvard Halvarsen, a fireman from the city who is also known as the "General of the Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking a drink important amounts of the drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than a rakfisk," says Harvard.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it is not bad; it is not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty struck Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, fish were kept during autumn immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of the winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and, evidently with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Only one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A current of the inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even does not make much wealthier than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered important, an essential yet quite illustrious part of the past of Norway.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the cooler of 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, among them men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of 22 July".
The Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
Following much of Norway's present wealth, the growth since the early 1970s has been one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're going so well," says Anna, our waitress, while she's passing trays of rakfisk and who, with her long blonde melancholy and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
Your English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn't have during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
"While we can ski in winter and make hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with an embodiment.
I'm in the snow tailing for something to eat; I've already had enough rakfisk.
Now a raised hamburger is definitely something different and quite juicy to savor.
But at night, he returns that lousy fish.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is celebrated in which comens vote the best fish, or perhaps the most testing of the nasal pits.
A TV has connected live with a pajarita presenter who is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Harvard."
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto Faces a Hard Start
While Mexico's incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant, discusses the challenges to be faced by the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad at the moment.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their jobs but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
It faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged into a war on drug trafficking that has already taken about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Department.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before co-operating with the President of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populated state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A Honest Man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, you are remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructures.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which means a huge improvement compared to the paved roads and full of berries that have been rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with their name at the entrance of a modern sports club and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his political friend and ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, Member of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"Particularly, with regard to security and economics, we expect the interesting and true change that our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was discharged by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mr Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations for Enrique Peña Nieto within the party.
It also rejects the qualification that the opposition lacks the essence of the new President.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic state man and, above all, he's a person who can hear."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated motorway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Early this year, military intervention was called for to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of women killed have been left behind in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics from Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he was unable to address the problem of feminicide while in charge.
The most critical accuse your administration of making a look fat.
In a concrete house, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendia has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I came home, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned up," recalls Mrs. Boundía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
As her mother recounts the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross where one word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like an old joke, a bulldozer, a quejica.
What they want is for you to just accept what they say and shut up."
"But that can't be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope it's the same kind of president that he was when he was a governor," says PRI Olvera's deputy in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, as prosecutors claim
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of Bradley Manning abuse during their stay in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period in Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest leaking of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation that Manning conducted in a pre-trial hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits by unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment it received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing carried out following the defence's request that the case be dismissed since its imprisonment had been harsh and that this had already been punishable enough, came one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At the sight of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after Manning's visits during his arrest at the military prison in Quantico, where he was in prison for maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning and annotated his answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning recognized that he had qualified the treatment given by the captors as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had spoken about those problems and had indicated that they would be addressed, but that they had not made a record of those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidences' (after talking about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I haven't mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a board to examine the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months before.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was located.
The military said that they had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is below the level of surveillance by possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the older state to know that I was well and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... in order to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the sea base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he had lost knowledge because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought he was going to die in that cage."
Manning stated that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most of his days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a cleavage, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while he was asleep.
He said that if the lockers couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed in January 2011 a formal claim on the treatment that Manning received.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about a claim he had made in his statement on Thursday that, after having been forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stand naked in front of the lockers and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced by the order given by the locker that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning stated that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his hemps to self-injure himself but that he had not.
Manning testified that night they had removed their underwear, chalks and glasses from their cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he experienced during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted in the war council, which is expected to start early next year.
The defence stated that it plans to have Manning found guilty of minor crimes and to defend other accusations considered too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention are justified.
The Pentagon has held that Manning was held in accordance with the rules of application for all detainees under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully provoking the publication of information on the Internet, filtering of national defence information, and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
Affirms that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who have gone; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely come down the explanation and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two tails: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stayed there a few seconds without being sure where to go.
When I grew up in Central California, I've been called "Mexico" all my life.
It's about ethnic tachygraphy, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
I later decided to become Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, tachygraphy or scripts were not necessary.
He was just American.
I speak Spanish enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the level of vocabulary of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the line of strangers.
I thought about that moment this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always the leaders of these two countries meet, it was found: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also wanting to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment a Mexican is so likely to stay in Mexico as he ventures to go to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America like the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of its territory to gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think of centuries, not minutes, the elements they remember are everywhere.
So, at the moment when a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and between the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Moctezuma stand in battle.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not.
The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was locked up the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fits into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, from a poor people, etc.
We are his descendants and are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our bonds with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this rock between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first know more strongly who they are and the second that bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered a part of the two countries.
In the meantime, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico you see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I've found out during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and press political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And, with pay inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you'll be alone with this idea, friends.
Fair enough.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still sorry about how their family members were treated so much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who first began, piles of buildings have been reduced to debris; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their ancient conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left all the pieces they like or don't like, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional rush.
Maybe this makes your struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their lethal dead-point situation could be unintended.
A war that won't be lost or won
At first glance, optimism seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November is maintained, this week's clashes have strengthened the hawks of both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders might conclude that time is in their favor.
Since Islamists have gained influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a reborn regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar has also done so, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members say that the Islamist average moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbulah militia party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until reaching Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
Above all in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
The Muslim Brothers, on the other hand, are Hamas cousins and their leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may appear as a protagonist to whom it cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military is concerned, Hamas has been placed on its site.
The Israel Hierro Cupula missile system has shown its effectiveness and many of Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more quietly... for some time.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly thanks to the barrier that runs through the West Bank, the main piece of an aspiring territory to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase, despite the fact that, according to international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party had joined an even harder line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the period prior to the elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why attribute these Palestinian twists by giving them a state of their own?
If they were truly ruling in the West Bank, wouldn't they shoot rockets as well as their compatriots in Gaza have done?
You better keep them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they lift their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel too much, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire out is a good wish and could mark the start of something.
Israelis too should think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder that will one day exploit in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography makes the situation worse as the Arab population increases.
Cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one that prays for sensible people from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel's assignment of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the cease-fire gives a little more impetus to the people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to put a stop to the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to devote his attention to it.
This attitude represents a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic Tobacco Packaging Act enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases shine on boxes of a green black blackout, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with an envelopment of a green olive, frightening images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies as children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the various images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, which have been mandatory since Saturday, is the names of the brands, all of which are printed in a small source type.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
He trusts studies that demonstrate that if a person has not started smoking before age 26 years, there are 99% chances that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Pibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco the counterfeiters will bring from China and Indonesia to sell it in the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited from the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone handkerchiefs and covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been shot almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Has said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was waiting for more stocks.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local businesses and websites, but it cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you sell tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews of brands from "foot citizens" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It is worth asking whether it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
Australia's British American Tobacco indicated that the industry focuses more on what involves new regulations than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Pibersek stated that the government had had discussions with other countries considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country that introduced the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, more stringent laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
"The photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
"Take the cigarette and save the package," says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Surely, there is only one reason why I would stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the Royal of the Pack pond in central Sydney, indicates that the uniform boxes make it more complicated to place them on the shelves.
"It usually took an hour to figure out a delivery; now I'm late four," Yu says.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it's, well, it's over and we close the store," he says as he raises his hands upward.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a bit bored
During the Thanksgiving parties this year, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane on which we were flying had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
To spend half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting about duty-free stores.
But more and more academics and experts in child development praise the kindness of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both us and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Borrowing forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits that boredom brings.
So should we accept boredom in a good spirit?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, it was assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History of the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The Boring, an animated story"), published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompey there are graffiti in Latin about the boredom that dates back to the I century AD.
We should also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research published and raising the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting, but not being able to participate in an activity that fills you".
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do anything but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly".
Boring can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed feel that they do.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Un committed Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the next room a TV program at all volumes that kept no relationship, others heard it with the low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or taking guarantees, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"Investigations show that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers in the 1980s developed a "problem of tendency to boredom."
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at West Florida University, says that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, adolescents are a type of group that is quite easily bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said he was bored while he was at school or doing his homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when he was not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boring rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest odds," largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, coming back to my question from the beginning: is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into the consumption of substances as a method of combating it, as evidenced by research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to touch the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch television, you may be satisfied in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your son is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not get bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or dosing himself," says Professor Fenske.
And "the ability to dose applies to other situations," he points out.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But neither should we be too critical of him.
Our objective should be, rather, to feel comfortable from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of seeing, we need to be bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate to something worth it," he says.
It points out that what people really look for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when noise stops."
Colorado: No instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community and football institute in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe that he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving along Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related articles (minor crimes involving each of them a fine of 100 US dollars) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes for drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor offences due to marijuana possession are being cancelled here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to hold charges against those over 21 years for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the most conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have committed themselves to moving forward with open cases of marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly authorized marijuana stores from being opened in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, right east of Denver.
Those in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacture, distribution and sale licences; all this before the deadline is reached, December 1, 2013.
They say that for good or bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states in terms of regulation of marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what could work.
"There is no true precedent that serves as a model for us," he says.
Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide "appropriate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of carrying out cannabis business on a radio of less than 300 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, Aurora's chief of police, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would cease to bring court proceedings for mild misconduct for marijuana possession to persons over 21 years of age and that the police would cease to bring charges against such crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said they would be responsible for enforcing the law of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to persecute drug traffickers and sellers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
At present, 119 people are faced with charges for possession of 56 grams of marijuana, although many of them have other positions.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal proceedings against those shortcomings that occurred at the time of the crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, district attorney of the county, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the outstanding cases for possession.
"I don't think he's wasting his time while he keeps doing the law until he changes it," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The conflicting reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier to district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents those accused of possession of marijuana and who is local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on marijuana.
"They've spent so much time taking people before the courts that they still can't accept it to be legal," he said.
By being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become test cases at national level in terms of the legalization of drugs.
While state lawyers and officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving directions from the federal government, which still provides for consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
The advocates of legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give in.
Despite the fact that there have been some outstanding arrests of patients and salesmen of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed most of them to have marijuana sales for these purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
"Although anti-drug agents are likely not to pull down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will probably be reluctant to allow state-controlled stores to sell marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a drug policy exaggerator from Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and it is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, a council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted against voting in favour of what the state voted."
A lot of questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I got kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory."
Students are not attacked by their views just now
I don't remember any time in my life when I haven't been dreaming about getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I was supposed to be the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at the Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the history career, I had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate some college colleagues having sex in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson announced jokes that I had gone because they forced me to drink in undisclosed cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I did, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because it came from a private school.
They harassed me for only one reason, which in the cradle of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbarian: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what's coming to that now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right center students is suffering similar persecution.
The growing institutionalized hatred of the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (group of graduate students) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people" for their political ideas.
They want to establish a position on the Equal Opportunities Committee of their university college to ensure that they can freely express their views.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC 2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: Young, Brilliant and Right) on student policy and presenting Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
He showed the graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with the silver grip.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" by the introduction of higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20 years old and vice-president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of left-wing in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old and history student at Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old and elected president of OAUA, says that the attitude of JCR members towards people who are in the right centre has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
For my first few weeks at Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I went to college in September 1986, she was a very shy 18-year-old girl.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The year before, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris cause" after the cuts in the funding of Higher Education.
The environment would have frightened any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness I expected.
I found that not only did the professors turn a blind eye to the fungus of conservative university students, but they were willing to participate in it.
The policy of the miners' strike, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the workshop's wooden rooms.
The first one to attend was to translate French texts from the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Mr. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
Don't say one.
Pitt, a low-headed man with a face that looked like a bizcocho mass, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Is that the thatcherists refuse to learn French or is that they are simply fools?" he asked.
The other colleges laughed.
I was burned at the eyes of the tears I was trying to hold.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt grunted.
I returned to my room as a grieving soul.
That night I sat alone at the time of dinner at the university; then I felt a slight slap on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OAUCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly told me.
"I'm afraid that's the way it's going.
They're messing with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Many Tories have just come to appear laborist."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to dissemble.
I insisted that you disagreed with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" asked one.
"They're beating each other off, aren't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who only thought like me after nightfall?
Should I become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that I was expecting were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly professor Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
They hated him not only from the Conservative party, but also from Thatcher's advisor in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place why he considered it to be provincial and insignificant and because of his adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I began moving from Oxford daily to my parents' house in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it is the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would be broken if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and gave up his creed.
The following week, during a seminary in which another professor of History had insinuated, speaking entirely seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old men."
The truce took little time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career in Oxford.
By that time my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was in a rush of fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they got packed and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you'll call me weak lorone.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party but is now hiding behind a reputation which is not worthy of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which was inaugurated this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, a former residency of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this during the inauguration of "Valentine: Maestro de la Costura", a retrospective apotheosic that brings together more than 130 high sewing dresses created by his "maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rich and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until the next 3 March, private cards and photos are abundant with the signature of the most grenade of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social promotion: of humble modisto of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they don't put off the collars of their pellets on your magnificent carpet as they do some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to their chalet in Gstaad," explains ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, she's a star.
Valeria Mazza, a Valentine's Day
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of modisto.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner on its floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
On every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Costume Week in Paris, in 1995.
"It never goes fashionable because its designs are works of art," it ends.
Acronya Parade
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions, but of well-represented love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the gateway to contemplate a dream "hearing" that lights Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that he chose Jackie Kennedy for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that he used Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and skin coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this public of mannequins, names such as that of Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and modisto, in 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "not able to forget."
I remember him perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gilette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors you use, they have great light and they are "donors" on your face.
The proportions are perfect.
The fashion queen and prescriptor Patricia della Giovanpaola d'Arenbergtempaco can never forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting old and the opportunity to wear one of their evening costumes...
Finally, the time came to the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flying skirts, draped "corsage" and chosen word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashionist party dresses with "the greatest care... because a dress isn't just a dress, it's also the set of memories she wears."
The "king" of fashion
The grand end of the exhibition by Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding costume with Pablo from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girlfriends" (as the modisto calls her seams) to develop this ivory silk suit with pearl incrustations, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority in the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in the high stitching of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Obligated for years with the elite's "being-being", Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of its clients' husbands.
"He has always called me attention to his refinement, his calmness, his pure and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of the Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time does not pass to him."
If a princess says so...
The world's hardest trade: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by loading 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone trails
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another that literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this, you have to go down every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the insides of the Earth is solidified by getting in touch with the air.
After tearing out large sulphur rocks, which total about 70 pounds [70 kg], they carry them in two bamboo baskets that carry on their shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb through the turtle, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps not to slip and fall by the precipice.
They know that any transplant could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who spent years ago at the risks of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents of euro per kilogram of sulphur they extract
Once above, they take a step between tourists who photograph them as circus monkeys and, with fatigue loading the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has located a little below, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has operated the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture waxes, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As usual it is to load 70 kilos, we take about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries three daily doors.
It takes three hours each and ends up wet, but allows you to add 18,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a misery for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what I would gain in the field.
"The miners' newspaper is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2) per day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (EUR 167) ", clarify the carrier, who used to work as a bricklayer on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the coffin was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a weight reason that, in Indonesia, is as striking as the sulphur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Then he has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, cough constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing the skin on the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to pass his bill despite covering his face with a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, cough constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in English more than acceptable.
Punished by life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a unclean wooden cabin with other carriers, rises every day at two in the morning because the sulphur does not stop eating at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the shadows, then goes down to the crater lighting with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers carry the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its small profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of the sulphur to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and thus the weight.
In fact, they don't even see part of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) charged by camera which, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (€1.2), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for the beasts and not for the people," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 kilos, ensures he will endure working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulphur burns the throat and picks up the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... Beyond, of course, it is, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and sores in the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
By swinging the basket over its back, Unainik can now only carry 50 kilos to its 53 years.
Each day, he and his companions take 15 tons of sulphur to the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away through a goat's path between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims opening his mouth well, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works carrying sulphur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the world's hardest trades: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and cost of property and education for having no children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an ad of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video turned viral on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bowl (bollo) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, has the hope that with the announcement they can draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform "his national duty".
This is something purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing evenings of quick appointments (speed-dating).
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
Spending $1.300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city of rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently estimated at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was over 2 - known as a replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeers have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, says that it is due to a "best education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aims at dramatically increasing immigration to address the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia is barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not being integrated.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling in the birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have 46 square meters surfaces and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the El Developers real estate company, says his "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units wear out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new standards provide clearer guidance for developers, who were once set to work if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre seems to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of property and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
The off-line private is private on-line
Privacy.
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it is about private quality or "the area of private life that is entitled to protect from any intrusion".
What is private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply to your everyday life and social networks?
Do you understand the dangers that you are exposed to ventilating on the Internet situations that you would probably not share off-line?
the Periodical interviewed five boys between 10 and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on a personal level, and "in the key and name of the user", when applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not post them," says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been accounting for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can meet them, but not everybody," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I'm having fun with my acquaintances, too.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or someone who's making the ridiculous," she says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked persons, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures to meet the 35 friends he has in FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just go up," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
Do not hesitate to reply that you would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even mind anyone recommending a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, for example, music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his home or his phone number.
"If I was pressed or required simply by the bags of my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not outside the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was extorting him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
"I never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, didn't close the bill.
"Just put her privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to safely configure the account.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
If I did, I'd get hurt or I'd like to.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he said.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, master in Pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite approach to what is appropriate or not to spread, publish or say to an age that maturity does not give for that."
"Even if they are selective when what they care most about is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Then, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people to tag them?
And one more, do you all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to let them see that they have to act online as they do off-line.
They're the same rules.
"One out of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, just as it should be on social media," he says.
Watch
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential that family parents read social media policies to the public.
By understanding each of the incisors they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is important to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
Finalizes Unasur Summit without making the Lima Declaration public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Declaration of Lima, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant representatives.
Eff attempted repeated opportunities to access the signed document at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Chancellor and Presidency noted at the beginning that they would deliver it after the closure, but then stated that it would at some point be published on the Peruvian Government's website.
In consultation with the text, they noted that the content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a few brief statements to the press.
Access by journalists to the Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information he circulated among reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which led to the malaise of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is the statement by Humala, not the official document that closed the summit.
In October last, Peru was the host of the Third Arab South American Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite the press's insistent demand, neither was the so-called Lima Declaration issued previously.
On the official ASPA website it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that there were secure transmission systems for all journalists, but to a maximum limit on obtaining information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgement by the Hague Court to settle a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they would respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations from both sides, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will carry out and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are leading to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean couple.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, along with the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Covenant of Bogota by which it had agreed to submit to the judgements of that international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the inaccuracies of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
Host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after the noon in Lima.
The representative read the outcome document, which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, UNASUR countries will give "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residency agreements".
He said that efforts are being made to improve "cooperation in the fight against national insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, low-priced internet access in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphal matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by bringing our countries together and generating new economic circuits," said the president of Peru in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to reinstate the Union of South American Nations", of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, Colombia's president Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional meeting he hoped to meet with his partner, Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute respectfully after a decision by the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will be found on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the taking-over of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the defence ministers of the block met in advance to adopt the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen the defence dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal where "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VIth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a country".
In this regard, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship that encourages the Unasur member countries.
"The free mobility of citizens and workers by any South American country, as already happens with members of the Andean Community, must be achieved, but there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also expressed support for the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who hold the Chair never commit to anything, and instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," Ecuador stated in reference to political asylum given to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa affirmed that he is not repentant of that decision because he has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process was not respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that the interrogation be submitted to his territory for alleged sexual offence when "Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out through videoconferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian deputy.
What is there is the danger of deteriorating your physical and mental health because you are confined to a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"That complicates the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution given to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a lifeline to allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is doing a number of procedures at different European levels," he said.
And he believed that "if Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this ends."
And if Sweden, as it perfectly permits its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took advantage to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and nuanced that what it does not tolerate is "mediocrity, evil faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not wicked and perverse politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard, it was pleased that these journalists are no longer "not the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and he went on to be re-elected "will further deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coupism clothed with legality" because it actually "destructed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian President also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries following the judgement of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, there is no dispute about that judgement.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed extensively to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime boundaries that are held in the same court in Peru and Chile and felt that "it is right for Latin America to seek international authorities if the two countries undertake to accept a decision as hard as it is."
With reference to the eventuality of candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite harsh."
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
In staff I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
Winning would be my last term in the presidency and from there we came out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan vice president Nicolás Maduro and told me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that he expected the campaign to go back to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The head of Ecuadorian State today participated in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Deaths by AIDS today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was as if a bomb came down to me," he said, recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "more gentle", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his birthday 43.
It is certainly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit at Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was bringing a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least in the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after mentioning that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immune system that patients present at the start of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 and 50 year count, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25, under these terms "while they stay in control can live without problems until the age of 75," the interviewer explained.
To measure this progress, we must remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS down from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, ranging from 187 deaths to May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why is there still death?
- It seems to me that the problem is not from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we haven't had enough medication the problem is that patients get very advanced because they don't know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a striking finding: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection that has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, it is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, they have to offer mass detection tests to all those who require it."
Specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida) coincide with their own patients, such as Fabrizio, who went to prove himself to a particular laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done so and, despite his short age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die already, I'd better come back three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take the medication.
To date, her parents only know she suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active, but responsible sexual life, I care for myself and the other person," Fabrizio listed, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, within the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let the test be done, if they were at risk, that in the sooner they know if they are positive HIV, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, your message, sums up the battle slogan to AIDS this 2012.
Condones behind the counter
Great are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, supported Ricardo Salazar, a Tapatio journalist who has assumed the cause about HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "there has indeed been an increase in the division of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of one hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want?" is a common question, with a smile and value trials of social workers, school guidance workers, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, assured the communicator.
I proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only behind the displays and those hundred are found in public bathroom dispatchers of the sites that young people frequent.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying for the scaffolds and motels, as Governor Emilio González replied, when he asked if there would be a reconversion of condoms in his administration.
"So it's not sexuality, it's best to approach condoms to those who already engage in sexual activity," he pointed out.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the bloodstream and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as there are 4 to 5 people in a registered case who do not know.
Ratified by an appeal court in the United States that does not know the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt through a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a disastrous precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures for survival of signatures that permit Mexican laws are invalid in the country of bars and stars, at the expense of international conventions.
On the practical ground, the backlog of the judgment issued on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Banking Court for the North Texas District leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of embargoing their properties in lease the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the United States Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
On entry, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the Banking Act of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the contract of trade processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational companies.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on Uniform International Trade Law was created, setting up the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the intercompanies vote, recognized in the critical mass of the trade contest the debts held by the Vitro subsidiaries with their mother, the majority required to approve the restructuring had not been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, the Vitro case has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose inter-companies debt amounted to the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth is, moreover, that by remaining the votes of the subsidiaries, the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the U.S. Courts, i.e. the "good" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The fact is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, this blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 to the brink of the severe economic crisis that he faced in the United States, pasting the country's collection.
Soon, the González Sada family's signature will bring an appeal for reconsideration before the appellate court itself to get the vote to the full of the appeal, i.e. the five judges, since they only voted three.
Failure to prosper will be claimed by the appeal of Cerciorare that requires the review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court filed a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of friendly curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competition Act, noting that it was disenfranchised with attachment to the conventions signed by both countries to tie it with chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has relied on the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say, the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: take Vitro and hit the country.
General Balance

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "The basketball has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Basketball Trotamunds Reyes was more than 60 years linked to board sport and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
And it's just that before a brain stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, he was a minor player, a national basketball player, a strong and leading in the BSN with the Bayamón Cows or president of the Balkan Federation.
"I put many hats on the basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a first hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball was my life."
Kings does not exaggerate by making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive trajectory, thus attesting to it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, those who treasure with the greatest emotion are those who recall their passage through the Cows from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old serving as a co-author or a takeover of franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be a part of eight cowboy championships since 1967, whether as a possessor, a co-author or a leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I fired with one in 1981, the debut year of Jerome Mincy at the BSN.
From then on he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had headed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very strong player, 6"7" of height.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartow then recommended to sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativeized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Champions' Championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at the distance, since by 1988 it was already represented as a federative mandarins.
By that time, she preferred to enjoy her executives and that of Mincy on the National Team.
I remember when we first won the U.S. during the preolympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived fourth place and it must have been bronze not to be for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Is this 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave it to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze in the world.
This team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, to the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been in the 90s due to an injury on the knee.
A team that might not be the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and great joy was the 1995 Preolympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Snows, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner in place of the players suspended by the mess of the Pan American of the Sea of Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt that was Piculin Ortiz.
Its numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that does not tell his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best ship leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Ariel's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
It had been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and at the beginning of the 90 BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What did you have to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, Ponce boys only played in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the island in national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessaryly.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, officers of the table and referees.
That's my pleasure.
What are you doing now?
All I do is listen to music, watch videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Kill actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, best known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a man of business without scruples, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family release provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., home producing "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
It was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss you very much.
"He was an original person and lived his life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies that were short-lived, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included papers well received by criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his greatest star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risked in betting houses.
It also helped to give the series a record of the audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter of November 1980, an average of 41 million television viewers tuned it and turned "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with slamming as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), hospitalized.
"I know what I want in J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here's the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, a co-protagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone "great, inside and out of the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, that we had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and one sixth was in process, the chain reported.
There was immediately no Warner or TNT pronouncement about how the Hagman loss will handle the series.
Coming from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who stellated classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage to counsel Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the New York theaters in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While he was there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought I was going to hurt someone or affect them somehow," said the Associate Press at the time.
After liver transplant he became a organ donation promoter and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but they'll be fine."
He was also an activist against the habit of smoking and participated in several campaigns.
They start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor in religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible anchor: The end of the "long countdown" of the Maya Calendar, on 21 December, to which many people have been held as a proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he expected in the next couple of months: Hurricane Cataclysmic Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "dedarmagedón" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of the times believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been," Charmé said this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good time.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory, the last of history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Medios, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform students of what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of the History of Art and Anthropology, have teamed up to give a course, entitled "The End of the World".
"We do not add '2012' to always count on the option of imparting the course again, in case the world does not end," Restall said.
Despite the " imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the same night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"He got tired in two hours," Restall said about his course for students on average high, who filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people who asked if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing career student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard about a class that could teach that," he said.
I like it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe on the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and somehow discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a senior student in the Temple, 21 year old and West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he claimed that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back to several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has raised these speculations.
"On other places people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about some course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, insinuating an exception from a superior authority.
We have a Pope's pardon.
Restall noted that many days of the final trial have been talked about over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin to think immediately on the next date" or to philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they're going to "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, 20-year-old communications student.
