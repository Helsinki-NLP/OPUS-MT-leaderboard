When are you going to leave?
Why can Taro speak English better?
Let's just do it now.
You're spreading lying news.
What's wrong?
I was expecting you last night.
You just made me feel so happy.
Parents are usually very discreet.
I was sleeping when Markus came.
I can't shake my right hand.
I'm hungry.
Yoko refused to answer my question.
Tom was very different from his father.
Like father, like son.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Tom pointed the floor.
Lately he's been a very good man.
He's from France.
Tom knew he heard something.
Health is more valuable than gold.
I am happy to help him.
Learning about foreign culture is fun.
When did you start wearing a lens?
Tom won't like the answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to contact us earlier.
Without fear, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnic and minority religion.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife's too blunt until it can't be used to cut meat, I'm finally using my pocket knife.
He's blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's forgotten.
Where have you been?
Passlights used to arrange traffic.
Don't let Tom see these pictures.
This room got a little sunlight.
He's painting a picture.
I shouldn't have blown that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I'm used to not getting sidetracked.
It smells really bad.
Words are words.
There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is a messenger of Allah.
Just yesterday I found out.
You can buy it at the bookstore.
Let's ride the Intercity-Express train.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My brother likes music.
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I thought I could come this afternoon.
"It's no use waiting for two hours." "Yes, this signature will keep me alive."
Tom was one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I just told Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's ants.
You'll never be able to find your way home, through a narrow rocky road.
Tom really wasn't home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
That guy's driving a car.
Give me the birthday card that's coming soon.
Please read it again.
When can you?
I'm just kidding.
Tom almost hit.
I'm going, too.
Love is never wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The cost has included payment for professional services to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn logo, do you?
Tom tried to persuade Mary to help him.
Two things are unrelated.
How can I not be aware of this?
What's this called?
I'm still home because it's raining.
That's the right answer.
Generally, men run faster than women.
To me, there was no fundamental difference between the cultures of these two countries.
She's having an affair.
Wake me up about eight o'clock.
Tell me why he's not here.
It may affect their decision.
The rain lasted all night long.
Tom's starting to get jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that awful?
I'll buy you this bag.
It's too sweet.
I encouraged Mary into the water.
Have you ever gone to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready.
Mary refused an invitation to a concert.
When are you going home?
He's sitting around his grandkids.
The boy was just asleep in his bed.
Jim's still not used to driving on the left side of the road.
He focused on those puzzles.
The man died a few hours ago.
You want to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We found out that the front door was locked.
May I speak with Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith is an acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying by plane.
I've assumed that he's lying, but it doesn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.
I can't finish reading this thick book in a week.
The election time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any other choice.
I'm not sure what else to do.
We've done what we can.
Is there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
All of us are equal before the law, but the rich sometimes have more advantage.
He must have done it.
I like cats.
The meeting was over at nine o'clock.
Tom was mentally disturbed.
Could I be crazy?
We're facing a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone has made a mistake.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mother's been gone for ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, it's just you can't drive.
May I see your coupon?
He seems serious to read.
Tom married a woman that was easier than he was.
He's a copy of his father.
He has good words to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm excited.
He tried to kill himself but finally failed.
Do you have any light beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
If I reincarnate, I want to be reborn as a cat.
We got a lot of rain this summer.
He made an important scientific discovery.
He's a student.
Tom's already here, but Bill's not here yet.
Laurie is fluent.
They advised him to go alone.
Tom was a good man.
I'll call back in 20 minutes.
They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom tricked Mary.
Not less than 40 percent of students went to university education.
Tom put his pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom slammed his voice so no one could hear it.
You see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is he long-haired?
She greets him every morning, when he enters the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very steep, better off on the left.
We didn't really see the accident.
His mother was worried about his son.
What operation is being shown at Lincoln Center right now?
I'm tired.
Tom was killed by Mary.
The data is often inaccurate.
Get up!
We've ordered that at six thirty.
We named the dog Tim.
He opened it quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom ordered Mary to follow him.
It's eleven hours.
I'm smarter than them.
It's getting darker.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knows him admires him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those guys are crazy!
