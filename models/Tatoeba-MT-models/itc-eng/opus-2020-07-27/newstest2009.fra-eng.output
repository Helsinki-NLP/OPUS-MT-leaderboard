At the end of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange in the negative
After Tuesday morning's fall, Prague's stock exchange rectified its losses.
The transactions with the ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague stock exchange renewed with its fall from the past, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the fall is due to the fall of actions on Wall Street.
The market response to the result of the vote by the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the U.S. financial sector stabilization plan, is also visible to us.
Action in Asia
Asian scholarships experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the clues succeeded, during the day, to wipe out some of the losses.
Hongkong Hang Seng index lost four percent during the trade, but later it wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decrease to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock move of the Hongkong stock exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually we managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to the index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation regarding rescue action in the USA will affect the financial markets around the world," observed Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hongkong is part of China, he establishes his own monetary policy, that is, independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates have the same level as in the United States in Hong Kong.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries might be affected.
The Blood Bath of American Actions
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the draft support for the financial system, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (near 12 billion of Kč).
The legislators thus reiterate the call for support from President George Bush's project.
Bush said the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
American actions have experienced, on Monday, a bloodbath and the main indices of actions have been the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced such a fall for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress concedes: the U.S. government can inject 700 billion dollars into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush's government agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
U.S. legislators made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns), granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not a sure thing.
Indeed, before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be reviewed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Reuters Barney Frank, chairman of the Chamber's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, the plan should be put to the vote in the Senate prior to Wednesday.
Economists say the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor to repair financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form that the market stabilization package should have," Dr. Nancy Pelosi confides to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to her, the final vote could be taken on Sunday.
On Saturday night in Sunday, representatives of the legislators met US Finance Minister Henry Paulson in order to give the bottom of the government a final form.
It should purchase from financial companies the invincible real estate assets that lead to significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to pursue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, Harry Reid did not escape, the legislators made the Congress reach a final agreement on Sunday.
They thus wish to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could influence the exchange of Monday.
However, it is now impossible to specify with certainty when the two Houses of the U.S. Congress will proceed to the vote, or if negotiations are not likely to be blocked at the last moment by a particular problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still be amended.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wished, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if Congress feels that the program does not perform its function, it has the possibility to block the remaining amount, following two steps: first, $100 billion additional, then, to finish, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress has the opportunity to set the decision as a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value falls, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to hold the vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Golden parachute limitation
The chairman of Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, protection of taxpayers from losses, the reduction agreement, the development of the time-axis plan.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of the said golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and for the establishment of a committee, which will ensure the monitoring of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new accounts in the case of mortgages it will buy, while reducing the monthly fees of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological aid
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we are unaware of the mechanism and the price of the purchase of the assets with problems.
This will be crucial in determining the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," says Marek this week at the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is to be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, so important.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, from this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at the moment," said Marek.
An extreme struggle: MP3 players against mobiles.
You will be advised, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
It does not prevent sufficient reasons from obtaining an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end expensive grammar to put on the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there's in your shelves of vinyl taped, with rock art, jazz or blues, you're probably dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, i.e. compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories depending on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for one reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have difficulty supporting listeners purchased for twenty crowns in the market.
These are two extremes, among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The life of batteries is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just reading music, but these are unknown functions, of course, most of the furniture.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, phone calls and text messaging, he is able to read from music and movies, record them, he has a variable quality camera and can, for example, serve as a navigational tool.
And if you take into account smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are almost witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantage.
The higher the number of functions you use, the lower the interval between two reloads.
And music reading is one of the most important energy goinfries.
Mobiles that are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours are rare, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you can call from time to time, look for a second recharge for the job - even for the more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are capable, following a reload, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing ones.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a USB universal connector, especially not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
You can, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to take it without any reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in the mobiles.
With regard to readers, you do not need, except for (iPod), any software.
Just fill in, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, or then the judgment of the user.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, in the way the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In the choice of a concrete device, are you especially interested in the life of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of output of sound and, of course, the ease of order.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you're going to listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just have any mobile reading MP3.
Practically all the furniture is available today.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to music formats that mobile or player is able to read.
All come to read MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have exactly this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also read WMA-format music.
The AAC (format used by the Apple firm and its iPods), as it is, is less common.
High-end furniture also enables, for example, the purchase of online music.
Simply visit the operator's (or other supplier's) web pages from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to obtain a musical mobile.
The operators' offer is unfortunately miserable and, in most cases, it is limited to radio tubes quickly made.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally believed that this way of buying music (either via GSM, the Internet, or even the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their mobiles on their own.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you only have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones or a handfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in enclosures, which have virtually all the mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The least expensive normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand crowns, we can already have a very suitable walkman.
In most cases, however, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also with an entry for ordinary listeners, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
On the other hand, readers have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really no one comes to order the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive ones (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the appearance of the order with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile devices (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have an exchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the extra purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Base models normally only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive get out even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding auditors, choose specialized walkman devices (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and so the ease of the control is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman-series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went further in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a life of the accumulator (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the marks mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win Czechia this year.
Maybe
The market in Czechia is relatively advanced, our operators offering almost the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, who would force conventional operators to lower prices.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
We have repeatedly mentioned on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTú (The Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, following the latest steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming fee regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How is it possible that Czech prices remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that goes far beyond 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú), who declared several times that there was no place in Chechnya for another operator, is chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network seems to be no longer very lucky (in fact, now, it would find only difficult to find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has resulted in a considerable decrease in prices, to which conventional operators should, in turn, also react.
Yet, even before the entry of the holidays such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to what we hear today at home would be heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and become the country's fifth operator.
We add that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which has among other things the U:fon in Czechia.
The advantage of virtual operators being the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need much less customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from relatively high construction, operation and maintenance costs of the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators appear as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers, in Britain, text messages at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, placing on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity.
This operator is specifically aimed at men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator that they like and to whom they can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work with us too.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesperson, in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
All the more so that he is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In Czechia, no chance, the mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Czechoslovakia, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successfully, but negotiations in Czechia are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area," said in a telephone entertainment for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman of the financial group Penta.
It therefore indirectly confirmed that the operators in Czechia were not, in any case, in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, has not, for quite a long time, hidden its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We are very much able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already held negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have been able to move forward in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl's spokesman.
The future is perhaps promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we could perhaps accommodate the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by a total silence.
"At the moment, we do not think there is any place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to other very specific ones.
At the moment, no subject has been contacted by a complex and serious project in this area," said Vladimir Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová states in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not registered for the moment a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead directs its attention to the completion of requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means most customer input.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities: in phase with the operators
The mobile operators' approach is easily understandable, another operator's entry would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
What, then, is it good to facilitate the arrival of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to hear themselves as larks in the fair. Chicane accompanying the creation of the U:phone also testifies to it.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTú, when creating the U:fon, was the one exercised by the T-Mobile company.
This is evidenced by information available to the public from the ČTú web pages.
Today, the U:fon is ready to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted on this subject: "Competition on the mobile market has also recently been enhanced by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and above all its services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of mobile operators here, the indifference of Czech regulators seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of the ČTú, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in Czechia.
The latter belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopts, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the relevant virtual operator regarding the rental of the required infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached for the time being, because the offer of potential stakeholders has not previously presented sufficient interest to conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the UOHS Department of External Relations in response to our question.
A statement thus made would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, care, so that no one takes advantage of his position on the market, such a statement is more than misleading.
Even more so, Kristián Chalupa adds: "Out abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their market entry has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in the sense of honest market functioning and lower prices does not appear to be part of the UOHS interests.
What is really shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if it really is a coincidence, naturally arises.
In the same way, a strictly identical price of petrol at all service stations is likely to be due to the chance and the hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not noted, in this regard, signs of anti-competitive behaviour, therefore, there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore none of them has an increased responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even the telecommunication regulator," said Chaloupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTú that telecommunications are, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts propose another view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on his network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the UOHS that three mobile operators are visibly proceeding in a similar manner.
However, complaints from many interested parties (including GTS Novera, mentioned above) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Taking responsibility for the ČTú is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the UOHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to introduce the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, an extension of ČTú's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
However, the representatives of the UOHS must know very well, but their interests seem to be elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
However, the operation of a sort of virtual pseudooperators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unclear.
These are companies publishing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but they are only partially public.
In most cases, there are firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specific mobile telephone services are provided for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms generally reach only elected persons.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company in front of the operator figure of a classic business client, which commands a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important client, she gets special price offers (and others).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If there were to happen what you are referring to, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and which could lead to an end to collaboration with the company in question," replied our question regarding this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has not been reached up to those responsible for mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator shall take a decision against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-neglectable benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to actual virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, they are obliged to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot have it fully, in the way ordinary customers of mobile operators do."
That is precisely what should seem strange to ČTú.
In addition, another question arises in UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to reveal such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the operators' explanations, which state that there is no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions would prohibit it.
When we will no longer be the most expensive country
As we have mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has resulted in a considerable decrease in service prices.
However, virtually in all the countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators were trying, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that regulatory bodies in developed countries, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Both through formal measures and through informal pressure, they ended up obtaining the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are dealing with this issue in the way a hot potato is being disposed of by transmitting it to a near target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But don't throw the sleeve after the cockroach.
If the flow information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market may be moving back.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will be unable to remain impatible in the face of the rejection (to discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the day of Czech nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the Kde national anthem housev m aj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem has again been registered by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with heart and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the anthem's arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
As previously entrusted to the Český rozhlas (Czech Public Radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good dictionary, so that one could understand the words, which they sang simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate, next year, its 175th anniversary.
The song Kde housev m'j rang for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), the Czech original play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously took it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It will remain one of seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymne sounds
The pragulous public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragous Transportation Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will be taken to the subway, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, it is accessible for about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day coupon or 90-day coupon (the coupon will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it recorded on their smart card at the information points and the offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transportation Agency), located at the Metro Stations Muzeum, M. Stek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letěany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday on, there is also the possibility to purchase coupons via the Internet on the web pages of Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who will begin to use the online store can permanently forget the windows in the metro stations, where they had to tread out impatience in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
In fact, they will purchase their coupons online and will be recorded on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these points of contact, there is a window available to passengers with trained staff, which will help those interested with the purchase via the internet and will also record the coupon they purchased on their cards," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Besides libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recall the machines to compose tickets and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly Metro Stations, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be ninety," Opatrný added.
An automatic controls the coupon instead of the driver
Autos that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just enter the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the city.
In the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of the Bohème centrale to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transports of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the Filip Drápal tickets of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of the transport in common pragois.
Periurban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's seat.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the location indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the checked coupons.
"If the passenger would need to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal completed.
Passengers who do not take the Peri-urban buses and do not remember the date on which their coupon expires may rejoin automatic distributors, initially used to record coupons on the card.
This is where information about the validity of their document will appear on the device screen.
The Sudets called for a referendum in the USA
In 1945, the Germans of the South asked that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (Scientific Library of the Bohème du Sud).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Germans from the South addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This is also the result of a preserved letter in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans of Český Krumlov in the letter urged the American President not to allow "šumavská župa" (region of forests south of Bohème) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well, and we want to be sure that the words proclaim that American troops come into German territory not in oppression and enemies, but in liberators," is written in the letter, "People, to whom Šumava's fate holds its heart."
Given that the rallying in Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, senseless attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter urge the American President to take into his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe, that you would grant this territory to a foreign State to us, that oppresses and destroys minorities and that has not contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of millions of inhabitants," is the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of "Czech Oppressors".
If the President of the USA doubted the Germans' opinion of Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or to live under the US patronage.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of the history of the post-war, appear somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sudetean period.
While the Czech Germans had to at least find out that the question of their expulsion from the Republic would arise, very few of them had such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to obtain a certain type of autonomy for the Southeast.
Others thought they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," Chalupa said.
None of the Germans captured in Czechoslovakia before the war thought that he would be expelled from the Republic following the Beneš Decrees.
Do not think — you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the moving media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš .ebíček's office believes that it will discourage drivers from driving dangerous behaviour.
This campaign costs 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving quickly and from driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, she wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "singling" slogan of the entire campaign:
Do not think — you pay!
The phrase "You do not think" is entered in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood stream, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay for a moment's attention from life.
The spots will "have" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will result in a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whipping strategy against drivers
"What works with drivers is the system of sugar and whipping.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time when it burns a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of drivers," said Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist at the hospital Na Homolce.
That is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist says.
The signs that indicate the danger to drivers are, in his view, already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return in exchange for peace almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli provisional government, supported the restoration of virtually all occupied territories in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), even all of them," Olmert said on a daily basis.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be done," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," said Olmert, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located within the Old Town.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he said.
Retirement of the Golan Heights
Olmert also voted in favour of Israel's retirement from the Golan's heights, which he believed was an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retirement from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the Hezbollah (Shit Movement); they will have to give up the constant support they grant to terrorism of Hamas (Chile Movement), Al-Kaïda (Terrorist Network), as well as that of the Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are Stewards in because they are illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of Student Agency company near Padua in Italy, the question arises whether the train drivers and passengers can travel within the bus.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a Steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road of the bus.
The girl was at that moment unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had at her disposal two other seats.
However, the bus can have an accident, or even a sudden brake, also when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical form equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing space equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Long distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; this was confirmed in Aksuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"This is an issue that we dealt with with with the ministry and, in the beginning, it prohibits any passenger travel.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the trip provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
Law ignores Steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of Steward's role - there is no legal requirement to do so.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of a vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds Hanzelka with greater ambiguity.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, the director of the Road Traffic Department, believes that the law is sufficiently concerned with the problem.
"It depends on the fact that the bus has in its approval permission to propose standing seats.
Everything lies in there," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing spaces and a limited maximum speed, interurban with standing spaces and a higher permitted speed and by long-distance buses without standing at the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert at BESIP (Road Traffic Safety) in transport security, does not see the displacement of flight attendants as a major problem.
"During a regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service on planes.
Also, it's not safe when there's a turbulence, and the hostess of the air can form its head."
"Or, in the event that the bus would have stopped abruptly, the laws of physics would of course be valid.
Same as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier has to manage the safety of bearings by internal requirements," he says, and also considers that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer Stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their business a business at risk.
"However, as soon as I feel like it's a risky business, I'll delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
This would also reduce the fees," he said.
The safety concern is the reason why the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, in comparison to SA, a very small number of lines, is lacking.
"We have no hosts. We have been opposing them since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up in a fatal accident," he said a year ago at Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has arrived
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for society for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a flasher and blocked the road by the bus.
The driver tried to avoid it by means of a sharp maneuver, but he frowned it by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for standing rest have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the young girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but for financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in view
An amendment to the Act, which has been being developed, for more than a year, by a group of 30 experts from the Department of Transport, could provide clarifications as to the travel of train stations on board the bus.
"Now, she has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she does not care too much about buses, but rather about the point system, at the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile on the steering wheel," said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the controllers to be a fundamental threat to passenger safety," concludes spokesman Hanzelka, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois rest on Frankfurt.
The key words were not missing in the letter sent by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could be constituted, according to the public mail on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "beam of competence" with sustainable productivity in such a case.
In addition, such a relationship could be the decisive move towards other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what this is like when a steering committee tries to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, injured, is still under strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Authority, which has only recently made it clear to the Government of the North Rhine-Westphalia that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, it has been asked for some time already - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some form between the bank Deka, who knows the customers of Sparkasse from their investment funds, and WestLB.
Indeed, the Chief of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas announced at the presentation of the figures from the late August half that he saw no meaning in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and by the savings banks groups, has commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts thereof.
The talks, however, have just begun, say the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, counts for one of the most important employers on Frankfurt's financial place, comes into play on the issue of consolidating the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a moment that the Deta-Bank could merge with the bank of the Land of Palatinat and the Halbab.
Nothing, however, came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had hardly been made public that the Government of the Land of Hesse had spoken against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Afterwards, neither the other two houses met.
The bank of the Land of Rhénie Palatinat was linked instead to the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there has always been new talks on the consolidation of the Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had, however, spoken against any trade strategy to merge with his bank.
In spite of this, the feeling seems to spread that the grouping of different institutions in the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could take place first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure of new mergers was to increase, potential partners would soon escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The group of Hesse-Thuringe savings and transfers, which owns 85 per cent of Helaba's capital, has, on the other hand, fired a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
I'd stick to the rigour of NordLB.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another facet raises the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be matched.
In June, Merl stated that the crucial issue, namely the commercial model of the future capacity of Länder banks, had not been resolved by the German savings and transfers group.
In the long run, WestLb's split could take place, which is obviously not desirable here.
This is also discussed in the letter of the existing Steering Committee: in any event, a 'global' solution for the establishment would be addressed.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank still to see.
The second weekend of the beer party is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a little friend, and so nothing is like that, he says.
Behind them, close to a ton of five liters of beer from the Kaiser brand, is a well-built barbu that shows about 200 visitors of the beer festival what deep sounds its owner can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then hugs.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the road station near the Puorta novo station, four buses take off at 11:45 p.m., `destination Monaco, feast of beer', expected arrival at 6:30 p.m.
Three buses are primarily reserved for Italians, on one of the buses travelling exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also loud, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long, folded coat of false fur and glasses with large silver mounts.
For the past five years, they've been going to the beer party, three new ones, just this year.
They go there at night, stay at the party, and come back at 22:30.
spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a manager of the German speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already driving in the night on the `Brenner' motorway.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
This is better, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with plates of Italian registrations once again take a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When early in the morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking lot near the Place Thérèse, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a last speech, explains the attack plan.
First: cook off the little yellow cap.
On it is written on the left `Beer party', in gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `knowingvisiaggiando.it".
Second: `When the doors of the beer chapel open, we're short', screams Marco in the morning.
'Courir!' Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
`Not in front, or else we'll block, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, you have to distribute them in the room!'
The chop, raising Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the advice!
`Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `This evening, come back here at ten and a half hours!' Got it?
And there it is, it's going to the beer party.
On the way, someone looks at yellow helmets with trees to find the way, signs and even an election display of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the `week-end of the Italians'.
There are no specific figures; it is said that 50,000 are on their way through the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of the visitors would have come from Italy this weekend.
The municipal police is reinforced by seven Southern Tyrolean police officers, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian red cross that carries out a statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is especially appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia nights for Hippo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word 'relatively' and he went so far as to see that the German banking sector would not be spared by crisis movements.
This has actually happened this weekend.
The finance of the Bavarian property Hypo Real Estate (HRE), next to the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid appropriations are issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Royal Estate Hippo should now pay interest on the fraction to which it is entitled.
Money comes from both private banks and public-law banks.
In the background, Depfa's daughter company supports losses.
The state finance, according to a newspaper article, had been refinanced in the short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to €2.37 million, and the equity rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period the previous year, fell to zero, the profits from the allocation of fixed receivables and securities and the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only because of the significant profits from the reimbursement of the downstream accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the deficit in gains of about 16 percent has been moderated.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state finance had first misspeculated on real estate industrial loans, which had subsequently been affiliated to the Aareal bank.
Because classical funding was not profitable enough, Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the child society, the Hippo Real Estate must make depreciations which should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group's gains and losses, which is still quite vague.
The fact is, dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been truncated to two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major investor in state and infrastructure since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on interbank refinancing since it does not have any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks was again considerably short, the banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Mortgage Real Estate needs an annual share - about 50 billion euros - of all Depfa credits from a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a Hypo Real Estate communiqué, the group's need for funding is covered by the medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of financial international markets largely out of walking status at present.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through funds up to the end of 2009.
The Chair of HRE Georg Funke's Steering Committee explained, however, that the Hippo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Establishment (Bafin) are based on the principle that the capacity of the Royal Hippo Group in the market is now guaranteed.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank only have to hope for it.
However, given the dynamics and taxation of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Furthermore, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used throughout its scope.
But neither can the opposite be avoided.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest communiqués, still at the gates of insolvency on Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least provisional will not succeed in reassureing the minds either.
The course of action fell from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The courses of obligations, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While debts to the first leader have barely moved, second-plan loan courses are declining.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo and those of course that have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hippo Real Estate bank had previously appeared to be an alternative speculative investment, and now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself that brought the crisis into the establishment by the acquisition of the Depfa bank.
As long as the emission institutes, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, we can assume a resurgence of withdrawals over time.
Or it will happen what no one hopes at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome within the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed noises of partial nationalization, the likelihood of approaching certainty has now become a simple, well-founded hope.
This should reserve nights of insomnia above all to long-term creditors on the decision to determine whether they should separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn on to be a deferral of the losses for the next few years on the next income tax for the automatically withdrawn stock exchange earnings.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, has to show up for the first day at High School in Tajikistan, the girls start to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word through the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already on my way to school, I was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to the High School of Tajikistan.
I have to find the way alone, I'm glad I didn't miss it.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be set as strictly as we do in Lower Saxony.
Students appear after each other from eight hours, until at nine hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not quite like talking to people, especially to a class of 40 students.
As I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, I went to the desk and tried to pronounce it correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have all made low masses, giggled with laughter and signs, and I have constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him through my sleeves.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary for the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "mignon, chou".
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite quiet, but when the gong rang, I was assailed in the rules.
Everyone talked to better people, they laughed and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's pretty hard to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My foster mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something else than the miserable Germans.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, con cucumber salad and algae, fruits and some sort of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the salted plums confess, brrrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to make a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read that in my sleeves.
I'm curious if I can see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
At the end of the day, reading sleeves, that's what I've been preferin' for years.
And in order to better understand the mangoes and the culture that is there, at one time, I also started learning Japanese.
It was clear to me that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, us and customs.
And here, they're given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach fled in the face of danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else has so far been able to prove it just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains present the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or in general consciousness, we enter difficult terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he does death, escape or attack.
Human beings behave in the same way, that is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective life to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and leadership and enforcement functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
All the less so for these aspects of our conscience that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that human beings differ even from other primates.
Another significant characteristic could reside in the linguistic nature of the Man: a large part of his existence being related to language, this often means that his conscience depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if the conscience was not to depend on the language, it would certainly influence it, so that the animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ a lot from most of our states of conscience.
That is why it is also difficult to determine what the consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses major problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of the consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal awareness processes could be examined without regard to their content, and that is exactly what happened in short-term memory studies of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the Prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what is the result then for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
What we describe as "sorry" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its suites, such as the reactions of the body) acquires from living memory.
As noted, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially the Man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impose them on others other than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the body sensation of the Cortex and brain trunk, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which however focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could fully participate in cross-sectional sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can't contradict it, but I think it is unde demonstrable.
Pankseep argus because what appears as fear in men and rats is likely to be as felt in both cases: how can we check if rats and men feel the same when they behave similarly?
A safe fled in the face of danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviours are not enough to prove the same experience.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the other hand do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the source of sensations?
And even if we could prove this to man: how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely to differ completely from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress is nervous to the extent that the same is measured in rats and humans.
Because I don't explore the language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We could think of this as a short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly springing up against a wall.
I am a pragmatic emotional person.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, European championships," Wasjunik told.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work just started, and there's still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both guests run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA always has our eyes on us."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There would be a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish press agency PAP.
"We assured the President of UEFA in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division league had already been sentenced for compulsory relegation manipulation in the previous season; the beginning of the League had to be delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid against attack
She wanted to do promotion for a new film, talked about her private life in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her former adulterin Dennis Quaid.
He's ecumenical - and counterattack.
A late Rose war for the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in a gruesome battle - in the sight and the mind of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan had expressed himself in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - is told the story of an adulteress.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his reputation as an unfaithful husband made it clear: it would be "Monstrous," he said to the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg will restore the history of our relationship and manipulate it again."
It would be more "resolved," that "the penalty and the disturbances that lead to a divorce for each child are renewed in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
Thus was his reply to the crackling: "In any case, my life continues.
I am happy to have a wonderful family that is going to be the best."
Prices for plane tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 percent.
The flights and nights of the hotel would become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the financial services provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and established, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by 6.9 per cent on average compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this were American Express in the low dollar rate that led to a "desir of down-traveling American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are held with an increase of 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
As well as the price of flights, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economic class paid an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-rail flights, which were very fuel consumers, have even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices in the economic class fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in the business class and in the first class, however, the price changes were significantly less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 per cent.
The German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be, on the one hand, diminishing economic growth, explains the firm.
The application would be transferred to many parts of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the Open Sky Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of non-rentable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have deposited the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find an eleven functional.
From Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster Landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player was only late in the game, and his upswing failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he was out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," whistle Hermann Rieger in the hallway of the clothing hall in Hamburg.
It wasn't much going on in the dressing rooms, and the middle of the day was over, and most of them had been reassured in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, he has a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that is why his application was received at strategic locations.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and raised the inch to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the Chief Coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Of which the orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The implementation was lacking.
"Everything wasn't very beautiful to see today," confessed Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "suity also to be more relaxed."
This 1:0 (1:0 in the middle of the day), the Hamburg team owes it to a head hit by Mladen Petri (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Marin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate on Monday its 121 years.
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take back," said Marcell Jansen.
It is likely that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals engaged - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as the decommissioned Jansen of the CF Bayern - certainly forms slowly, but it does not shine yet.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the vote has failed
On Wall Street, fear travels.
The first news of the rescue plan's failure caused the Dow Jones temporarily to drop 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a little bit.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock exchange index was 10,579 points with a five percent drop.
The Nasdaq Technology Fellowship Index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers in the Dow Jones were at that date American Express that almost 14 percent lost and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could bring any more profits.
Bank Goldman Sachs' actions accused a drop of almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called damaged mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid once, but progressively.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that may be exchanged in relation to the evolution of the course in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.
Courses for action in the European and United States peat
Billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not address investors' concerns.
The course of the action of the large German bank Hippo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax towards the bottom.
The US Dow Jones Index collapses despite the saving of the state's financial market.
The German Index (Dax) has led to a deep deficit from spectacular declines in the courses of Hippo Real Estate and Traderzbank.
The actions of the Bavarian real estate financier have at the moment lost three quarters of its value despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has charged a 20 per cent drop.
The Dax clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of the 6,000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 per cent.
Worldwide, stock markets have fallen on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with sensitive losses.
Investors feared that the 700-billion-dollar United States government's heavy rescue plan could not be sufficient to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The House of Representatives of the United States intended to vote in the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate should be held on 1 October.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts are concerned that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the "Ulysses" space probe has been flying in space.
Because of soon frozen fuel pipelines, cryogenic death threatens him.
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
For example, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European search probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, just like the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave at 100 percent of the way it is expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
More than that, irregularities occur at the speed level.
The probes become faster or slower in an unexpected way.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him with anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's general relativity theory, which describes the force of attraction to matter because of the curve of space, might not be entirely correct.
U.S. physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always believes it's hard to make Einstein fool and try to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also located near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter for only about ten years.
It appears to be a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e., it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed it.
The Sudanese raiders had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be under way.
The Germans are constantly in the Kidnapper Hill.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what has been communicated in concert with Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the newsletters on the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their state of health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well and secure, announced Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the tour in the desert should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances around a shooting before the hostages were released are still unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without screaming.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the officer.
There was nothing left but to collect hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had shot down on Sunday six of the raiders in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had stopped two of them.
The hostage takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be handed over by the German woman from one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages took a delay because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the bullies wanted to free women hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the raiders found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law who leads to suicide."
A court was informed that years of abuse by his father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians, in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after having admitted eight counts of charges for improper charges.
The Truro High Court referred to his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, who was 5-7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, had committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise had attached to her and banned her before forcing her to commit sexual acts, while her mother was working in the pub.
Trerise and his wife got divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwalls.
His daughter-in-law left for Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer of National Trust, was harassed by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had reported that Miss Randle, who was a good surfer and a cyclist, had appeared since 2006 "emotionally dead", and had "lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the beautiful father of his daughter, who had also written a letter of confession, which concluded: "I attached her and her bandis regularly".
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Justice Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetish, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This disgruntling saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what is even more surprising is the fact that if she had not done this, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "I particularly point out, as his father and mother describe him, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stéphanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Departmental Officer who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be sentenced by the Officer Secrets Act, to the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train towards Waterloo.
The documents came into the hands of the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
This is the least serious conviction of this act, without any innuendo of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguard of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services.
His lost documents contained reviews of Al-Qaeda as well as of the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies in the face of B&B invoice.
British building companies may have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savings.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savings, including 59 from the building.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it's "irritant" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be reimbursed when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interests that are going to increase at the same time will be debited annually to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits .
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed at the BBC that the 59 buildings companies are included in this list.
It's annoying to see that the institutions that had a cautious behaviour... now have to pay some of the bills from the institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is claimed that each company must pay a proportional amount to the deposits it owns, and that the intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest of the loan will be raised to £450million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Company Trade Committee, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that the institutions that had a prudent behaviour at the resumption of the real estate market now have to pay for the much less prudent institutions.
According to BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"we need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be taken to prevent the companies of the building and their members from paying the bill in the air," said Mr. Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year will have to be paid, which could be doubled.
Since the companies of the building are non-shared organizations, their members end up paying the invoice either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five penny per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the wholesale price of her milk, five penny a litre, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price that followed a two-penny increase in February, and comes as a result of a search by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide if they go in turn, increase the price to consumers.
. Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had been changed for the last time, in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh has been denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail application from former PM Sheikh Hasina, which is likely to be arrested on his return to the country.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to grant her bail because of her examination for having extorted a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was PM.
This is one of many accusations against him.
Khaleda Zia, the permanent rival of Sheikh Hasina, was relaxed on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks' time, but her party, Awani League, demanded that the provisional military government of the country give her full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of his release are contradictory because if he was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, he could not see why he could not remain free when he returned to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she does not require bail because she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after 17 October, said a former leader of the Awami Party.
She was detained last year after the military interim government assumed power, but was released in June to take care of herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, denies the charges they face.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-police campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
The United Nations made a vaccination campaign last week in the six provinces.
However, she said she was unable to reach children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, south of the country.
A United Nations spokesman said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the judicial battle of ITV
BSkyB has lost his trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would compel him to reduce his participation in his rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation prevented competition and enabled it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement to actually prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that the purchase by BSkyB, shares of VTI, had cast doubt on the effective independence of ITV, thus encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Ofcom regulator were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB retorted that forcing her to reduce her share of VTI would not be reasonable and instead was excessive – especially since BSkyB had just waived her voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutors' case.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special accuser to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born from the record of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of the White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who claim that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thereby obstructing justice.
"Seriously criminally unfounded allegations of conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the release of nine U.S. prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But it then emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no longer criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to assign these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others have refused to investigate charges of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and pursuing judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they may be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ends up being accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and at the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, stating that he considered him "the first responsible" of these dismissals, and ends up abdicating" his role as leader, "remarkably not to be involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including the former Bush collaborator, Karl Rove, were critical of not being able to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will have to be honored.
The Rock Star Meat Loaf, must be honored at the Q Awards for its epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit of the 1977 Meat Load album.
The award evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, the editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly went away.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, demanded a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was traded in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, pointing to the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name- has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure his heartbeat becoming irregular, after falling down on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then we found him a cyst in the vocal cords.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and maybe soon to be sold.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous ones, others only functional ones.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-standing local residents are unable to give directions to go to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to confuse with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to reopen Extra Place, and create a more smooth passage to shops and shops, which should open up in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbours, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the pastry of houses.
But the Department of Preservation and Building Development of the city that runs the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of committees of neighborhood owners, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay drew up a proposal allowing the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remain in the city's hands, and has asked for a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee #3.
"There is only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and install seats there, some of which would be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, it doesn't necessarily mean she wants to be the owner of it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to look at this abandoned drive, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of the Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, pointing out further that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than to manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been bearing this name since 1802, when the legacy of the great farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has been abandoned since.
The subsequent entrance to CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo cover of Ramones' album Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramone manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, stripes, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already spoken about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be taken in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Answers: A Nostalgic Regard on A City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, dark, day-to-night, and bound by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and Persians, full of newspapers last week that fly along the sewers."
A few exceptions near, the street is always the same.
A short rat agile at the bottom of the alley, near a door that once led to CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce beer bottle, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown out.
Some passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have been held in dark, wet and disgusting places."
Bilingual Debate: Diving in English
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former student in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as You do not think. Why middle classes should be able to choose their school."
Attracting the approval of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign points out that "Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." that's true.
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program supports in particular among so many other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that defends instruction in language classes other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a elementary school east of Los Angeles County.
Students at this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than one third of students, consisting of many new arrivals, are studying English.
Of the CM1, 100% students passed the 2008 math state exam, an expert level.
As well, almost 93% of students have passed the English-language exam.
This incredible success was achieved by another ingredient that Mr. Obama put forward.
Sixth Street focused on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, this school has introduced the English language education "full immersion".
The total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in education.
Melle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, said to me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying him."
"It works, she observes, "it has worked for us"
Obama should not take the example of Sixth Street Prep and reply to it in the other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr Obama's response.
Although he is in favour of the fact that immigrants are learning English, Mr. Obama has recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaims that we must all stop arguing about the wording of the English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he said, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider the models of education that work, rather than dedigning them or regard them as insignificant.
Oil Net Drop in the New World Economie Concerns
Oil prices have fallen significantly on Monday, as people are afraid that the rescue plan for financial marches will not succeed in restoring life to the economy.
The operations of crude oil have dropped by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. New York's Mercantile Stock Exchange at this morning's sales.
Prices have dropped by more than $20 in the barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the markets for raw materials have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having known in July, an increase of $145,29 in the barrel, prices dropped to almost $90 in the barrel this month, before rebounding in view of the deep uncertainties of the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned despite the rescue agreement, the biggest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis will be a lasting one.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase the Wachovia Corporation banking operations, the government said this Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments in part nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that the frenetic negotiations this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement, seem to have failed to revive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"the prospect of global equity, interest rate and market exchange has become uncertain" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a letter to their investors.
"we believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contamination.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular, in China."
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the drop in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, therefore were forced to decrease by 20 percent, the forecast of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Day of the Second Time Determining for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After having spent the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform from the Shaun Ellis Jets, the defender thought he saw everything.
He looked at the second time, when the jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had salted under dark clouds.
Then the Brett Favre back quartet succeeded in making a pass in Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of an after noon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns, the first one when a corner back fell and the second one, 10 seconds from the middle time.
"I'm not out of my area" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mediocre player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing the catch, the defense beat the Cardinals' back quarters, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens lets the ball escape because of Warner.
The last change, the loss of Bowens' balloon, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20 yard goal with an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best Jets could have scored in a while.
"Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "second time or third time?"
When we told him both the Jets let go 21 undisputed points in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebsellasie rested, exceeds its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, has again proved worthy of his title as the best background runner of the century, having beaten his own record from the world to the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 of an accommodating race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, played last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, of the 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - it may be excessive to today's eyes, - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at first, 55 on arrival- Gebrselassia has won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the decline in the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa wins in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, had suffered cramps in the dock two weeks before, and had missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I went there last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He was accused - especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia - of having too much orchestrated his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering the world records more than the sense of the competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebrselassia's capabilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. to my way.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the lead was gone.
A little over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made her final climb to steps from Kwambai, which ends second in 2:05:36, improving her best five-minute personal record.
Kamathis arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19.
English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She was not able to participate in the games in Beijing because of a hypothetic back, but she promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skilled strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan riders to take a great advantage, then exceeding about 18 thousand 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia arrives second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, ends third at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Orgueil and the trials of the Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, brilliant and giant Orlando, there is a quiet little town where pride and complications of the Afro-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make today."The city with five lakes, three croquet, 300 dark skin, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival that is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes has become tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression- Era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he loses."
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue on race theme, many here remain cautious of the foreign look.
"we are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, a resident of the city and the oldest parish priest.
"it must conform to reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and combat.
It represents both a historical model of the power of blacks and a community of almost 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point but also an example of South American rural culture - a few times delineated, sometimes acclaimed - which recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere books, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "They Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the center of Florida, often forgotten, leading to the chapter of black history and the human drama.
Audacious such a big cashier in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"passed the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds whose Howard Miller has always taken care, although he hardly knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used for passing people.
So, just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality " says Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston immortalized, citing colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "some people have not appreciated."
We still remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who came back frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on board a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many were mocking her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also added, swinging in his chair of the later patio that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "it never remained too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black wife of the 20's Barnard College, she was buried in a tomb, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy it offers to the world " says Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography by Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials from Orange County wanted a five-way highway in town to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main street in the community.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville returned just from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race mix dispute led to hatred at the doors of the community.
"At that time, a band of white youth came to throw oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady has even died."
They launched a pastry of their car" .
In a letter from 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorious of my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened the trust of young people.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember - we embraced our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as head of the Saveguard of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because it's white," said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have allowed to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as she, armed with a cheerful trust and lines of conduct such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited the anonymous tomb of Urston and began to fight to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclaimed by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to American cannons.
The motorway project arrived just as the most famous girl in Eatonville had found her attraction.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston regard her as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that this highway would generate.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival's inauguration two years later, and many come back in January, to commemorate it.
After many years, it was rebutted by the motorway's proposal.
"The five-way highway fiasco, extremely fast, real civic pride," said Melle. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed up the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the motorway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, started to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A mono-themed library (of course named Hurston) opened in 2006 on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, revised.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be regarded as a back street after a summer rainy day, as small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
( 90 percent black is now available)
Foreigners who have come to discover the history of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still treated with caution.
We must ask permission for most interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weak for living red, are still afraid that their island community will not be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to regard Eatonville as Hurston as its entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, mad and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is much of the sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of the nephew of 18-year-old Franklin, Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional strength.
And even for the younger ones, such as 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, Winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people, passing through this area, will think, "Oh, this city has nothing compared to others," Alondra Kenon said after last Sunday's Mass.
But if you stop and take the time to look at the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, they all talk about finance.
Still, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newsstand and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think only in the glass and bee offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst working day at the office" since the crack of 1929.
The deliverers continue to flutter on the sidewalks, with their trolleys and muffin dishes for morning meetings.
Latinos always drag between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging on a yoke arranged on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue to buy their morning sandwiches to street merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16 and 19 hours a week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I was planning to work at the end of noon, as I discovered at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people tailing.
Not in front of the caisseurs' windows, neither to withdraw the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service window, where the usual customers ordered their checkups, the tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I'd learn later from Starr, my "authorized personal banker", all tailed for the same reason as me.
Not the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called Thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in a state, and that say treat customers like their families.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 capital bank has used the bankruptcy union, and as the New Yorkers would come home for the weekend on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, to account for a value of $440 million, desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and store employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential break, transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, or the one that makes the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and of her lean CEO Dick Full, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the concierge in uniform of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetables merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Unholy Muslim tombs as Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Philip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "citys against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting red-cut mosques.
The Police accuse extreme right-wing extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of the far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; it was police action.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as David's Star; however, detectives believe that it could have been done to disguise the extremists' hatred toward Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somewhat related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community declared himself "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which only occurs during the religious month of Ramadan that reaches its end.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining courage, following its oscillation to the right during yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that have increased almost 30 percent of the votes, Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the port of the scarf and the burkas, and even expressed his opposition to the alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are attempting to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter forbids travel abroad.
The courts banned the glamorous rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse of children, of expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after expressing their intention to travel to Spain through France to the authorities in charge.
The police in Kent had given this prohibition to travel last Thursday after proving to the magistrates Glitter guilty of sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the trial in the limited courts of Ashford, but was also represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson said "on Thursday, 25 September, in the Ashford court, Kent's police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64 years old, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leave to be registered in the lists of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent's police said she would not discuss any particular cases or potential Glitter displacements in the compound.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, "Kent's police will do everything they need to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"if we do, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize the potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, 10 and 11 years, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him in passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities denied him entry into their territory, and had therefore been forced to leave Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow's airport on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the limited court of Uxbridge, West London, for registered in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom, for the detention of images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travel to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no scissors.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, released from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On one side the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers intimate gestures and stolen views of artists who do not care to get on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatre of some performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer resumes the specific iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of Flamenco Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" may be no one but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sadness, joy... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality from these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a clean personality and character.
I was interested in creating an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of the flamenco stars."
With the festival "Chant Popular des Mines", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph the singers, guitarists or dancers with a plated camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the material, recall the classic photography.
The implementation of various stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with his art.
The search for the essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that has been presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sports" ("SportART Project").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people, knowing them and being able to enter their lives for a longer or longer moment.
I think in the photograph the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You're standing in front of people, characters you sometimes don't know or leave you just a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at the 20th Street of the Mata, parallel to the Peupleraie d'Hercule, which will be open until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "very bold"
The novel takes place in places where no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has for the main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize Prize in Literature yesterday confessed to the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real daring" and that "everybody demonstrates that it should not write it."
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't, but I would, and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the four-day exchange of ideas and thoughts that he saw parade in the city of the aqueduct about a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and completed his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award in the majority of the participants' votes, made room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The Festival's presenter, Felix Romeo, faced a fascinate audience who did not see the past time during which Peru, with a wonderful memory and a great dose of humor, drew back the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote of a "very methodical way" through an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "inspired loss"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less similar", because the writers were asked to "don't let themselves go to frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils Pozoblanco's fair
The party of the flags that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse tingers had verified that the arena was impractable.
In this way, the Organizational Committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather hit this fair, since finally two out of three parties couldn't take place.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
At the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who should have faced in the arena of Castilblanco
So only Friday's party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after having made movements of arms in front of the bull with taste and aesthetic.
In the afternoon even Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the steps discovered applauded more than his fight in himself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos with no pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a significantly better fight, he was whistled by most of the audience.
Police control of a van in the province of Arava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours less than ten in the morning.
Movement control of the Basque Police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants from a van and the latter take the flight.
Its loading, more than two tons of hachisch, what to stop them from.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A. J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was accused of drug trafficking and of falsifying documents.
The incident took place when various officials from the Arava Traffic Unit carried out vehicle controls on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were preparing to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the control started.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the coast, where the two occupants came down to flee to a forested area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachisch they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, a Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch balloons and then transferred to a police station for comprehensive inspection and drug weighing.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been "false" because it did not coincide with the one written on the grey map of the van, which is also why they charged the prisoner with a crime of falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee, A. A. J., was cautioned to carry out the various steps and will be tried within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara, California for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesperson from the California police patrol unveiled to the People magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30, Locklear "fully supported the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and left his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the drug and alcohol centre to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was removed from the beginning, although "according to the observation of the police officers at first sight, we thought that Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of having led under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned around 1900 hours and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous breakdown.
Flamers requested the Andalusian Federation of the Left United to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The coordinator-general and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of conducting favourable treatment for members of his family.
"In these cases, I am a very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the conduct of the political party he will adopt in the City Council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Mayo's blood", Garci's bone pair
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish battle against French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euro budget.
The filmmaker tried to "show the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours," Sangre de May » will be released in the cinema halls next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci ensures that he made this film "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to play a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was based on national historical facts.
The EUR 15 million provided by the Municipality of Madrid is a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has deceived itself as a leader in the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Capitaine Alariste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than twice that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he was unable to film a few written scenes in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with which he collaborated during almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Back to Start" influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he used to repeat before starting the shooting and to whom he does not do casting, as it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and to the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times the Oscar candidate (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films representing Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de May", "Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner, "The blind sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "who would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect a price.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you're working only for prosperity, and now you're just making an extra movie," says Garci after over 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the Swiss dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevillane dancer will pay tribute to a also sevillane dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and an Oriental dance specialist.
She was a passionate pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and plaid for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who has marked the history of dance in Europe of the inter-wars, has fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter proposed to interpret the Swiss dancer Tortola Valencia and it seemed amazing to me."
According to the dancer, "we don't try to tell her life but translate her way of thinking.
His dance titles made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers," she says.
The performance was made thanks to two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of her shows, as he had done at "La door open"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with her student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me."
The performance was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were regarded as divas".
This work also tells, in some ways, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in places so far away, especially at the time, such as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it is these women who have enormous influence in their time and now no one knows and does not enhance her work," says Bayón.
The show will start at 8:30 am at the theatre Lope de Vega
The publication of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" in the church Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Trinnat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" came to an end with the re-issue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This people of light" which was inaugurated in May and which, after travelling to the various Andalusian provinces, will be in New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has purchased eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal", published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most known Andalusian poets.
America Less Without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "The Absence of Evil", and illustrates well the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been turning since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and now I've lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence."
Nobody was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, American esteem has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there is only humans to admire and there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug combat created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own bio food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had the difficulty of imposing itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put the bar on us," noted George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today trying to penetrate the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from the goals.
It is still not easy or possible in today's media jungle.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even if the opportunities did not fail him to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends meeting his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Among all the great roles he interpreted, he was never as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropy," he says.
Madrid in the race at the organisation of the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid could organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I ever took.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of an elimination note.
But let's look at everything in detail and from the very beginning.
Mistakes begin with removal of folders, which forces you to move forward.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it'd be better than they give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They only made you go there to take the back (first error, move only for this) and (after a long waiting line) surprise!, there was only the size 'S for the jersey (second error, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy that little jerseys with less fabric and less expensive blow?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your back bag at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue of wait, the competitions started and we had not yet left our back bag at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait for more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults took place in the barracks.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me who, I think, did not mark the departure correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, it would not come to me in particular with the idea.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O.s.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft Emerging Technologies Conference a new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented, a species of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to travel on the company campus) in response to what was asked during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the place, who they are - including recalling which posts they occupy - and listening to and hearing the key words of their conversations.
But also bring them together according to conversational groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and she tells her she'll answer her in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
In addition to a change in strategy at Microsoft this week.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery as Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding features and "extracts" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google's first move to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operating system will always be required as this is the essential basis for understanding the hardware and software.
It occupies the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, but more and more to the Internet browser.
We only turn on the computer to turn Firefox, Explorer, or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than running windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can have the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, busy months, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they eventually become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the restrooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "You are looking for. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not go out in early 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the phone is increasingly like a computer.
But since Android's launch is delayed and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso hung him on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio carried one in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino in 'Le Parrain' by Francis Ford Coppola and was part of the association of muscle gays.
And if we start to list all its apparitions, we could also quote this mustachu rib that raised weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple men's shirt in cotton, mowing and without sleeves.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles is distinguished from all others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as ' Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' is distinguished by its excellent cotton, by its unique cut, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (almost recognizable) that the most well-known body jerseys have in their neck.
But pay attention, because the Belgian brand not only produces top tanks.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babes, mini-shorts...
Dresses designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's a shame to only wear them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important prices of fashion than the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day, but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 1950s and 60s enchants us and we inspire much for our collections.
I love walking in town and watching the women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman: aren't you?
I believe that yes, but at the end of the day, everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's closets and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my dress.
Dancers like to dress very well for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And as an actress, when you wear your clothes, that's when you actually put yourself in character's skin.
All of a sudden, it's all connected.
You were not 30 years ago: was this hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are happy.
I find the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoy life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I've wanted to do since I was a little girl, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're going to be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me, and I want to become a young mom; I don't want to lose it.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies. You're waiting for the different movies you shot last year.
It's true, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I'm a woman from the theatre, I'm very impatient and worried, I'd like to have everything now but of course it's not possible.
I look forward to the films 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you're gonna think...
A few days ago you started off on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to do the mannequin.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for a while, to invite me to participate in London in a charity show for her association in support of women and the clothes we display - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold for auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender person.
They say so much about her, I know her, so much isn't true.
Besides, the great side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Flying alcohol recidivists will have to install the 'alcohol' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcoholism to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the start of the vehicle drunk, or does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is to reinstate the driver by offering him road re-education courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety, but also the Directorate General for Road Safety and the Foundation Institut Tecnologic pour la Sécurité de l'automobile, will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness, take the car back.
Alcohol would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the breather and prevents the start of the vehicle if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the permitted one.
Its cost is higher than 1,000 euros and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people every year.
This is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be carried out on a regular basis, but, however, criminal reform requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the scheduled official time, the Spanish air force aircraft in which the Asturias Princes traveled landed at the Presidential Hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico DF.
The sun was about to go to bed, but its rays still had to put their hands on the face to see the royal couple come down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to finish their official journey.
- Oh, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... is it you by now or then...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Asturias Princes are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military range of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in marine blue, the Princess, when to her, has her hair in the wind, is dressed very heavily and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with photographers before going to the room where the official court is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a Rigolo journalist from Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
Surely there is no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no live designer more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international image of the new talents of fashion.
The winner will be rewarded with a price of €300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his models in Mango's window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept for it.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square metres of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank Stylist Valentino, president of the competition jury, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier de Paris.
With a table next to that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and making against bad good heart, due to the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a dress of Mango and some hairs of ELAH, which cut the breath, and arm on it, arm below with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high – she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron de Rochechil finished the evening without a dress because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with a pants and a shirt - of her own collection - and who for dinner metamorphosed herself by wearing a sexy and black long dress, got excited when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet repeat room and recalling the old time, she grabbed one of the bars and she did the gesture of a 'big fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she showed us first on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moved on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and had asked in advance that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, here's life.
1001, the number antistress
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenesia of daily life.
And to crown everything, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The morning awakening almost saddens us when it sounds every morning at 7 o'clock, but it's even worse when we think about the agitated pace that is imposed on us by the present life.
The office is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat day-to-day fatigue and labour-related problems.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole menu of methods adapted to everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the bookstores directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to obtain peace in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manuel' degrades such belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or natural recipes that help you relax.
If the adrenaline does not run into your veins to restore the balance of your body and if the stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the sofa, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking in the middle of the night
Some kids talk at night.
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens may surprise you, but in reality it doesn't matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep that is called a dreamloquie.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking during the night.
This may occur very sporadicly (once in life, for example, associated with a severe fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day according to the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other sleeping disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (beeping in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very severe fevers, stress situations or overexcitement.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or on the contrary with screams, cries, long speeches ...
In the event that sleepoloquia becomes very frequent, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We said this is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep disorder that can be cured (e.g. if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm inwardly.
This will enable the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the nightmares appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he won't remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if you experience anxiety several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), you do not have the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep, he's not conscious to be able to organize his mind.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, from the thought of how you will interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Don't ever tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing very bad, it's an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Finally, Illhaeusern found the way to victory on his land after a long period of dissect.
Without making a big game, the Jaunes and Blacks created the largest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this encounter where attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the captain of the visitor Kauffmann who frowned the lucarne on a distant shot, Illhaeusern would take slightly the ascending and turn around founderflick from far, then with Hirn above, Romain from the end of the foot or Diebold came to chat the defense of Dannemarie.
In front of him, we were stuck in the middle of the field and we were just leaving him at the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half-time was to be decisive with first two occasions signed by Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and soon after the opening of the score for the Illousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball repulsed on a first attempt by Diebold (53th').
But the Illousian editor will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return the lockers a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose major problems to an illustrious Eleven who just retreated a bit to "compact" his defense, apart from all the last few seconds of the game where, after a big choking, the ball passed very close to the cross.
Sarkozy to meet the fishermen in anger
Before flying for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour by Brittany.
In the face of the demonstration of force of fishermen who had greatly disturbed the access of several ports of Breton and Normandy on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "Criss-Creation Committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of oil prices flying, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of mariners."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out escargot operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing plugs of about 10 km.
The pleasure port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle-Island did not stop.
A filter dam has been launched on the nearby island of Quiberon.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning from dawn tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic façade and the Manche, such as the Olonne Sands, in Vendée, where the trawlers remained on dock, or the Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Donges refinery.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting in the department to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday about the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview planned for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will leave nothing" and "they do not want to move to Paris", for example said Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they feel that the cost-effectiveness of a vessel is only reached with a gas oil of less than 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The remarkable performer of Butch Cassidy and the Kid died of cancer at the age of 83 in his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes praised the legend of the film and involved actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian airliner is on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the global economy's threat of recession.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft operator delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much of the Chinese market, especially for his planes from the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider assigning more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have reflewed, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to reimburse the $85 billion that has been advanced to it, according to the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its life insurance to the international and its retirement activities in the United States, the newspaper cites sources close to the file.
The board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to discuss possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from IGA.
Assets that AIG plans to separate include its Air Leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in Transatlantic Holdings and its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, the FT adds.
No final decision was taken on these transfers, the FT continued.
AIG must quickly make cash to repay the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting to two proportion of the current shareholders.
Analysis Paris History of the session Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching the 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, with technological dominance, yielded 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the House's unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan representatives to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 for, the representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two in three Republicans rejected their plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market was counting on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would not happen "too late".
"If the project is actually dying (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, Chief Economist at Global Insight.
And increasing the sense of urgency, "every day that comes to bring the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, she stressed.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy Friday, the authorities organized the buy-out of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United States, Iceland and Germany, signs that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bond declined to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% Friday evening, and 30-year-old to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% the day before.
Obama, winner at the first TV duel
At the first Friday debate between the two White House candidates succeeded another to know who, by John McCain or Barack Obama, took him away.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic Campaign QGs proclaimed their own victory in this TV show that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honourable, has not been "brilliant enough" to allow him to halt his decline in presidential five-week polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose an opinion survey published on Saturday, grants Obama a five-point advance (49% versus 44% to McCain), considers that it was the democrat who drew his pin out of the game.
In the indecisive voters, who are those who count, Obama came out victorious for 39% of the polls, while 25% of them win McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected of his tailor, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
It has good instincts," but Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventeen years ago, McCain kept pointing out his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing his opponent's "navity" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." did he accuse many times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he also assured.
An angle of attack since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disunity, he was concise and precise.
He has put forward his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, if," retorted, this weekend, a democratic spot accusing the republican of not having taken the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American street".
"During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, denounced Obama, yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a beating rain.
He did not even say the words "medium class" or "workers."The financial difference clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the brink of precipice.
"Next week could be a turning point," said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating that 95 per cent of Americans would still be able to reduce taxes, despite Wall Street's sobries, the Illinois Senator also pointed out that achieving the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates excluded the questions relating to the $700 billion financial saving plan (EUR 470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there was an election?"
Young people and opponents manifested on Sunday night in the main place of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislatures in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday night as soon as the polling stations were closed on the central site of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resign."
Some confess that they have not even voted: "What a good thing, since they will do what they want with my voice," says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been a good figure for foreign observers in order to resume their language with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if those elections were considered by observers as their own.
They didn't do it according to the opposition.
"We have been held apart from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the clearing," Iouri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential office and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is that it counts the votes, and in us it is the executive power.
If members of the opposition come into parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we are not reforming, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition was concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process did not recognize the validity of the vote.
It points out that participation figures appear too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was an election, you asked the Social-Democrat leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night returns to the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
Interview - Blood returned safe
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of his foundation, and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Hema-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously shaken by the scandal of blood contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public grunt, in February 1994, the Government of Canada instituted a public investigation, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would not happen again.
While Judge Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces had set up a committee to plan for a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has completed this mandate.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, barely 38 per cent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was discouraging.
In an effort to improve the safety of blood products and on-the-spot work during the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said proudly before affirming that in early 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle from its inception on 28 September 1998.
At that time, many cases of the human form of the disease of the mad cow, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, were emerging in Europe.
"And we didn't know at all whether this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, that when it is not known and a serious disease may arise, in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom was refused since 1980.
A few years ago, however, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (TAN) that allow the presence of the virus itself and not the anti-virus virus to be directly detected in the blood of donors, based on the tests used to date.
The NTAs have allowed to shorten the silent period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors are infected without knowledge and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV through a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the security of our products.
We never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year on Réunion Island, the Chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus, was transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continued before stressing that, in addition to a security supply, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
"The needs are increasing because the population is growing.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cell or platelet recharge.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Every person in health, aged 18 and older who meets the eligibility criteria, however, can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who propose their blood are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is severed, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they age and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so scary, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving of his blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye cells and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste adds to a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample and we plan to take more than a thousand a year.
It should begin to be proposed for grafts at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Mothers are disappointed they can't have access to it," because Hema-Québec has no means to propose this complex and costly program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in semifinal
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 victory in total of the goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, at the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series in the total of the goals, at Sapputo Stadium.
The middle of ground Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a goalless first half on one side and on the other, the David Testo and Rocco Plancentino terrain centre marked the other threads of Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
We recall that during the first round of the round, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in half-final.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder reached a 3-1 deficit in the game back to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached half-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Victorious goal of Kovalev
The trio number one of the Canadian is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn stimulated the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win at the Dams of Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec raised two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to do too much in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a great ovation."
Charest placed on the North
The Prime Minister shall not exclude from holding elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was finished, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left) tried to be elected during today's partial election.
"Strengthening the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was designed a kind of Moulin with images.
They turned around, on three large screens, spectacular clichés of hydroelectric dams, mining operations, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Major means as in the election period.
In the press, the Prime Minister also refused to exclude that he would launch the elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the recent Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister refused to explain why the North was "a jewel to the immense potential", but did not give due time, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: including hydropower, forest, but especially the mining sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's listing.
This "Territory twice as big as France", "it's at our house, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it in us, but it is in us," he insisted, as well as showing that he was demanding a national founding myth.
Quebec has built much in its relationship with the North, has emphasized: the gold road to Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's us, it's our future," he added, after having taken a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has specified the Prime Minister at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat this position on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the passage from the north-west, which will open all year long because of the meltdown of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the Territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pakistani MP of Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
Development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal Prime Minister who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which started on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed to rebaptize the Beauharnois Central in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made the James Bay, our party knew how to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press, he invoked another conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest pointed out that its implementation was planned for 2012.
"That remains among us, but I plan to be there," he entrusted his militants, raising in their homes a warm applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably in 2009, did not deviate from the possibility of holding a poll this fall, which the law allowed him to.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was fulfilled, including by a mission of the council of the federation in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that went as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the broad lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
Pakistani leader Pauline Marois pointed out the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up its implementation.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today," said Mrs. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (the vote today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADA said it supported the government's adoption of a North Plan.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, in place of Mario Dumont, who is returning on vacation today.
Letters — An Unhonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice in Harper's office, who last summer allowed herself to say of Louise Arbour that she was an "honest" for Canada.
To cast reproach on this woman who has waged an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration to say as long as the Prime Minister's environment is concerned, as is Stephen Harper himself.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have returned its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts against him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and allows a child soldier to collapse under inhuman conditions.
The only person who commits to a court hearing to assess the accused's guilt.
It should be recalled that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr for a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that shuts its eyes to torture: no matter whether a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, no doubt never after so many years of exposition.
We do not yet realize this, but at this moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", this word that Harper keeps swaying and sounding so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: you can misuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a head of government until now minority (so it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that upholds the Green, the Law, and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, she's here, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In his September 17th edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the largest gold company in the world has attempted a defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the bribe in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecution in defamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to lead to the ruin of anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the editor of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defence and to fight, with very unequal weapons, an army of lawyers supported by almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
Tacticals, in these unequal struggles, are often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a resolution on the friendly who will banish the opposition and to crush anyone who will dare to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it's in public opinion that she should have presented her vision of facts.
Contrary to what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada usually take place with the exchange of ideas and not with a matraque.
It was therefore sufficient to open his books, his records and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and reject requests and letters of support from Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could both ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the views of that same audience?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word refers only to fat lawyers paid and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports Black Canada's authors and publishers does it first because they reject the brutal way of mining.
This audience is prepared to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a prosecution-beam (by pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a re-establishment to Black Canada authors urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's pursuit is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies the right to quote credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which form the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that appeal to rich businesses in this world in a country such as Canada, who will be able to do so for repeated prosecution?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada's authors.
She has a right to reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's repeated prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms that limit this type of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Hear
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by the two chambers of Congress.
It provides for, inter alia, better control by the elected authorities of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to look at wages paid to executives of assisted enterprises.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done in such a way as to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do so, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on the American daily life will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to the spirit in the last few hours, fearing the effect of a new failure on the mood of investors.
The time limit for the opening of the markets was given this morning.
Late in the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their discontent that it would be necessary to reach that end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed certain provisions to the agreement, including the one to allow owners to keep their homes and the one on the salary of the leaders of the companies managed by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be welcomed.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television waves.
Asked about another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The great lines that I have read [show] that it is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The choice to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the dubious, risky and unsolicited debts of the US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of the mortgage at risk (subprimary) credits before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a freeze on liquidity and on the disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elites who had led the first draft of the agreement last week.
It is believed that this impasse has been removed since Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round up the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government was to take five years' losses with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its delivery.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be endorsed by another vote of the Congress.
In return for his assistance, Washington will be able to obtain participations in secure companies that will be valued by dividends in the event of profit and that he will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures for housing related to the land loans concerned by this plan, as well as to set limits on the pay and departure allowances paid to the leaders of the affected businesses.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plans will have green fire.
In fact, votes continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
"Of course, Washington is not listening to you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Committee, at his electorate.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the benefit of taxpayers."
Animator of a small group at Congress called "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presented things differently, but reached the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention by the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up its full-fledged competitor since it lost €2 billion (US$2.9 billion) in the U.S. venture real loans crisis.
Strong employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"It's not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, a right to vote in the bank and influence is recovered.
It's just something that savers and households now appreciate the uncertain announcement of time."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be in the process of nationalizing another bank, which was hampered by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would return all outstanding loans to the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than US$ 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) of real estate loans to its account.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customers accounts of the UK bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Dead of an icon committed
His beauty in the eyes of the blue was long his card, some of them will say his weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His powder, sensitivity, and talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the power register that fosters the true sacred monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of age, following lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema for years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he had long been a kind of screen rival, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the freedom and the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, with a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born.
No ego measured, last brand of quality.
Because a whole country, from the self-made man, from the Pacific War fighter, was planned for combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, on television, soon at the cinema.
The same man who fought for civic rights was also the driver who ranked second at 24 hours of the Hand in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappearing with him the shadowy areas of this secret, discreet, engaged, allergic star at the booms of the show-business, of which the enigma will not have been completely penetrated.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance sought the vertigo of cinematics this weekend, as his great roles intertwined on the black screen memories.
Over half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parades through it.
Back in memory, the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a suitable burning roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we refer to his sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone into history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, a delinquent, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Lices Me (marked by hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, returned after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
Amer and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will resume the character on the return to Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which in 1987 his only Oscar on nine appointments.
That face through the ages, it was him.
Again.
The times are boisterous through its path.
Young people know him primarily through George Roy Hill's cultivistic Slap Shot (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of a low-orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Brother Coen's The Hudsucker Proxy.
With a last role as sponsor of the Irish Mafia in Road to Loss of Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
In contrast to several movie legends that left the trade soon enough, Newman will remain on the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its facets and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humour, "as a challenge living to "underplaying" judging his over-supported benefits.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom roles have long been cooked in the beak.
However, he played the young first ones less often than the marginals: neuroses, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman reveals poorly known facets of his true pudic sensitivity.
His wife Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew an end to a feminine portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of powder and sadness.
Among the rains of tributes on Newman yesterday, his great friend and former weapon companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very distressed: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant features of the missing actor.
Beyond his career as a legend, he also exerts himself as a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of Hollywood's drifts.
We will have seen a lot of his thunderbolt on vinegar pots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of bad taste, although gag at first.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, has been engaged to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and in sum.
What could have made Zuschlag &amp; Company in their invoice factory well?
On 8 October, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin, against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, which has caused particularly serious damage; other charges have been brought against them, such as false and false use.
According to the public prosecutor's office, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and the municipalities, approximately HUF 65 million in total, went on the one hand in the caisses of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and, on the other hand, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to pay the money of the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus, the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they were supplied with invoices at the Józsefváros market, while they made the caches in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were to be included in the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested an invoice, on the model on which they made the other invoices they were to introduce, inter alia, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the City of Capital for access to grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András 'ri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with drafting the necessary files for obtaining the grants.
One of Lados' choices was a bistro during a "review circuit".
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Foundation Jövěert, which will later be named Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, was groubling in form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and up to ten people could spend the night there. Yet, the bill mentioned one hundred thirty customers.
In their accounts, neither Jobb Jövört nor the Hoppá's, according to the information given to the public prosecutor, did they also fall into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, which also belongs to the Horeca sector.
The company's manager, Gy the Farkas, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He added: "Beyond the shape, the fact that, according to the invoice, one hundred people had stayed there, neither did they collide, since this establishment only counts eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
Zele invoice issuers have also not been informed about Budapest's travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but are organizing only foreign travel. Thus, they have, by no means, indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be settled in cash, which also goes against the agency's accounting practices.
Moreover, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the benefits relating to travel activities, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the rate of VAT of the four invoices established on behalf of Hotel Revfülöp in the order of Jobb Jöv'ert was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. In addition, the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the fakes were handwritten.
The public prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made errors by mentioning as a provision the carriage of goods by road, that the issuing company of invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
Furthermore, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of inadequate invoices and false seals, that invoices issued in the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány of XXI. Századi Kulturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehertó's sports internship, both of which refuse to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Faussaries also failed to pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to take a meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the company’s liquidator did not have such an invoice.
Deliberate invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were required to issue fictional invoices.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal Group - Ifju Szocialisták, has established an invoice at the order of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredert, for a sum of HUF four million.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and in 2003, issued invoices under the order of the Jobb Jöv the Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the association Vörösfeny the Egyesület, for an amount of approximately five million HUF, but behind which no benefits were actually provided.
Neither was there any financial movement since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies did not mention it in their accounts.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the Director General of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with fuel trade and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it was found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, this company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipment was allegedly purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, and that he robbed their countervalue.
It was precisely at Ivan Kubatov's request that Romanian masons created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were working, which the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
He also used these companies, since, at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as the editor of the founding acts of the companies, he established invoices to their names, to the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov gave to organizations, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The parquet believed that 10% of the amounts indicated on invoices as well as VAT were in the Kubatov pocket.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictional invoices that were used in connection with Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség Association a Modern Magyarországért applied for a grant from the public utility organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this grant for a two-fold amount of HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the objectives indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictional invoices received from the Work Team Kft were submitted to the TMA.
Furthermore, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the office of Arpád Kemecsei, in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a part of the accused will report the method of making invoices, as she had already done before the prosecutor's office.
What might be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to raise the veil over the whole history.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the slightest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps, the socialists would have concluded an agreement that in return for the reimbursement of a large part of HUF's 50 million, Zusi would carry only the hat.
Today, the latter is likely to be vexed, as applications for his supervised residency, based on a lightening of his detention conditions, are continually falling into the ear of a deaf man.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, await their own home at the end of the procedure. He does not have this possibility.
Over-the-counter psychology: why do we spend more money?
In auction sales, buyers tend to spend more and overestimate the goods.
Neurology and Economics researchers from the University of New York have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic bases of this apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as auction sales on eBay, and that is why they prefer to even pay too high a price.
These researches have attempted to develop a neurological scheme of this type of "game" using experimental auction sales.
One of the volunteer groups played the loto, while the other group took part in a playful auction sale, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging process (RMF), researchers analyzed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the sale of auctions whose essential element is the auction of one third, the whole under the brain trunk, called stritatum, was moving intensively during the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the leak in the face of the violent reaction of the stratum.
In support of their theories, economic members of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups were overcrowded against a partner, under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they did so.
In another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would get out of the game, then they would receive an additional $15 in reward.
While the third group received the $15 before the auctions, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed on one victory, while at the other, on failure.
By thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the player team "against failure" were willing to take higher steps than those performed by the control group and the "to win".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena found during auction sales only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped eliminate the contradiction between the two theories, leading to, now, a third explanation." - Andrew Schutter, professor of the University of New York's Faculty of Economic Sciences.
Hepatitis: when should we consult a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
Hepatitis virus patients in Hungary are estimated to be 100 miles away, but only seven miles after treatment, which is because patients often do not know they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to liver-related infections caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and yellowness are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases generated differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, are propagated primarily in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g.: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic liquids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, vaccination against A and B viruses is also recommended. There is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, in general, accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible yellowish, the saddles become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die of the most serious form of this disease, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not aware of the virus, because the pathogen destroys the cells of the liver in a sly way. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing.
Pollution is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor who treats you as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
On 30 September is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the organizations representing the sick in all parts of the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does he who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of analytics, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article in which researchers from the University of Oxford have developed an interesting experience by analyzing how much belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of human beings.
As part of this experience for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electrochocs, while each observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
The results show that Catholic believers have been able to exclude much of suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and disseminating the electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look sustainably at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Hermine Lady painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a sort of state of faith among believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, was about its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, they received 20 electrochocs in four successive parts, while looking either at the painting with a religious theme, or at a more general theme.
The Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safety", like someone whose "care is taken care of" and they "s calmed down, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious themes, they reported 12% pain less than when looking at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in the atheists, provided you find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image in front of which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, it actually changes our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if a Madonna painted by Leonard or a painter of the same caliber were shown to believers?
Would the view of a better Virgin Mary cause better results?
You're what you're spreading about yourself.
On the occasion of his tenth birthday, Google says that he can be found at the bottom of people's pockets in the same way as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they are consulting and what their centers of interest are.
However, it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
As far as skeptics draw parallel to Orwell's horror vision are concerned, they do not see the essentials of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary for Google's founders to meet their initial goal that sounds like: "Get all the information in a system of the world!".
According to Google's interviewee, after ten years of global work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
To the question: what will it be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What work would be best for me?" However, the software will only be able to answer this kind of question at first sight, that the day they will know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all netizens that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Customized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and can consult what they have looked for, on what they have clicked. As a result, in the long term, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to provide much more personalized responses, and will submit products and services based on our previous declarations and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against power that can trigger counter-reaction among netizens.
It is, however, confirmed that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most resounding example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing an identification.
Internet users who are concerned with human rights have been able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, the arm below with the EFF legal protection body, has proved its right to the FBI court. According to the judgement rendered, in the future, Google will still not be forced by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information about the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted many years earlier. But ultimately, it has failed to obtain lists of private users' searches, nor the full list of websites and keywords of the past two months.)
The judgment of Google is therefore quite contradictory: it is flogged by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their privacy and private domain suffer when they begin to use Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that we manifest against the proud multinational societies of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savage" bringing together the passionate, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "gendered incorporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and program package, continuously cooled, has a much more accessible effect, younger and cooler, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what Web 2.0, the most popular keyword of recent years, exactly pulls out behind it.
In fact, web 2.0 is nothing other than collaboration, that the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use communication channels at our disposal, and while the dimension of these ones changes one by one, the essence remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A youth, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can connect them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which they automatically appear their latest photo galleries that they store on Flickr or on Picasa.
While we can get acquainted with many examples, such as that of the little friend who easily understands the pictures in the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the society that has fired one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about the top management, one can be on something: the term of privacy is completely to reconsider today.
The one who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and that is how the principle can be defined by hiding behind the behavior of today's youth.
He wants to hide something, or at least, he wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, he can do it (e.g. starting with Scroogle, using Google's search system, but at the same time leaving no intentional trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not smaller. Google's online services, through text processing to image processing, may be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and which do not resemble our best profile, which have existed so far.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding from it, the moment that Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense's advertising areas threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while more and more high-speed services lead to serious migraines not only in Microsoft, but also to many other computer program creators.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management refused, in its entirety, employees' protests, after it doubled the price of the company's motherhood and after the company found it too costly to restore multiple daily, taken at any time. All this seems derisory in addition to the fact that in 2006, Google reached before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is about, is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some believe that Google's draft scanning and archiving of books and magazines takes such important dimensions that society will soon find itself in the face of the Supreme Court of the United States, others tremble in front of its Health system, because in it, complete medical profit can be built from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian Halftons, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way only through Google data.
Two minors helped to remove traces of Ozd's double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. Based on suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the commissioner department of Borsod.
Young people have recognized the facts they are being accused of being complicity.
The two minors, who, according to the information of MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of murder may result in detention for up to five years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ózd, a young man in the corner of 23 years, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it was found that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and that is why he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ozd where he killed him, as well as that 9-year-old boy's daughter.
According to information from the STI, the young man premedied his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish made even though, previously, the Czechs excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the actions are in the hands of the Polish State that wants to separate itself from more than 60% of its actions in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the purchase of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna stock exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London stock exchange, and the Deutsche Börse have so far made an offer.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague stock exchange, said last week that among the interested, the Warsaw stock exchange would be the best new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague stock exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated at between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent participations, followed by the 14.7% of the Ceská Sporitelna bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, increasing from day to day, European press leaders already mention a "second 11 September".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the president of the United States" - accuses the daily life of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president was not even able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised to the va-vita, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as referred to by billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, the political leadership there has led the world economy to collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system grows every day, and then the whole world is going to pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to Congress's vote, a real threat, which Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - highlights the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still hold a lifesaver to their securities, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, we need the European Union's states to make few cases of their national selfishness, and to centralize control over the divided financial markets.
Only on Monday, the weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - reminded the Viennese daily Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands on the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really taken care of the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses, partly, the old continent.
The "savitors" should not immediately shake a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noticed in which case it would be rational to reach taxpayers' money, with the objective of preventing more damage.
The smart car imitates the bourdon's flight
What would be the best way to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if it is not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
Like, for example, that of bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, which took place in Japan, the budding bees gave the strategic starting idea to Nissan engineers, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-robotized, BR23C-type system, which he has equipped with bee qualities, with the ultimate objective being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
In the course of its flights, each bee is its own space, of oval shape, which actually resembles much of our safe protection shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand.
The bee's face-eye plays an important role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the face-eye, engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles at 180 degrees angle and at a distance of 2 metres in front of BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor, which transforms it into avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Contrary to any existing system, this avoidance maneuver is carried out in an instinctive manner.
"If it wasn't, the mini auto robot couldn't react fast enough to avoid the obstacle," says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must be carried out in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, only the rotating movement, acceleration and slowing down as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot could be used.
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentration is greater, making their life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only deal with a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo-bytes of continuous memory.
There is no need for memory of a capacity of giga-bytes, or even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards the design of an instant avoidance technology. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its entry into the cars manufactured in series in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price
The written version of the $700 billion economic saving plan, aimed at buying the dubious credit from banks, and multiple uses, is ready.
In the first round, half of that sum will be spent.
Reuters announces that during further debates that continue until midnight, on Saturday, the local time of the east coast, the leaders of Congress have agreed on the disputes that have existed for days and days, around the rescue plan of a total amount of $700 billion.
"We have made a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the US House of Representatives, saying that there is nothing left but to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, commented on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a matter of saving Wall Street here, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8:00 p.m., local time in Washington (i.e. Monday at 2:00 p.m., depending on the local time in Central Europe), but did not cause spectacular rise in the scholarships.
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in the name of the emergency economic stabilisation law of 2008, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also greeted the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress achieved tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson for the White House.
In addition, the programme diverged from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which stated that the $700 billion should be spent on one single time, for the purchase of dubious credits.
The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first sum will be used by the Treasury Secretary to purchase dubious bank receivables, while the use of an additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase dubious receivables, mortgages and suspicious mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent persons stated that purchases can take place as part of an auction sale, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees the tools that cause the concerns, for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast purchase of dubious receivables, their insurances, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system causing the collapse of one or the other major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps, to be ready for the enforcement of the law, as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders in bad positions and waiting for state aid can expect their starting allowances, simply called a gold parachute overseas, to be capped by the government.
Wage caps are only mentioned in specific cases. Moreover, limitations depend on the way in which the Treasury secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The ceiling principle means that if the Treasury secretariat buys in the context of an auction sale, they will collect a surplus tax on the gold parachute unless the retired bank president leaves the pension.
Directly after the purchase of dubious receivables, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not overstated.
For the image to be complete, however, it must be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling concerns only the new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force regarding the opinions of the directors general - the chairman of the House of Deputies Committee on Financial Benefits, Democrat Barney Frank, has commented.
In addition, the State provides a right to acquire shares in banks participating in the plan, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can even be earning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will return to their feet.
The bill mentions that in the coming five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will determine how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That's not why American citizens sent us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that they are the same ones who insist on taking action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise

The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and chemical manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This has resulted in a deflation in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry increased from 0.2% to 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, representing a significant weight in domestic industrial exploitation, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices established by the authorities since 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sale of processing sectors, the oil processing sector prices have been the most significant increase (32.4%).
In the metallurgy manufacturing sector, prices rose by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food production, beverages and tobacco, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions have occurred in the textile and textile sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the price increase increased by 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
Throughout the processing industry, prices increased by 10.2% in the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded 18.7 per cent in the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and by the allocation of sectors, in August, it was the investment profit-making sectors that showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and material-producing sectors for subsequent processing did not experience any change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and material production sectors for further processing (16.8%).
In the consumer goods production sectors, 6.8 per cent inflation was measured, while in the profit-making sectors a 1.4 per cent decrease was achieved.
Industrial export prices in HUF increased 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent in 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment decreased by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, and by 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar. Compared to the month of August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that, by January 12, the American-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will enter into force. This is what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now, everything depends only on the moment that electronic inlet and control systems outside the Atlantic will be put in service".
At all times, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations today, in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will give the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Order of Merit Star of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with foreign policy advisers of candidates for the presidency, democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, along with John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, assured their support of the 700 billion-dollar government rescue plan. However, there are politicians demanding the resignation of the US Secretary to Treasury.
Following marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives at Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded agreements of principle on bank rescue plan.
This funding plan, with the objective of getting rid of the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as fiter than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with the introduction of economic questions, Obama has again succeeded in obtaining some advance. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a colitiser just after the republican convention, has foundered.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote on the 700 billion rescue plan.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages he also supports.
"Now it is necessary to act, with responsibility ... a threat to your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
There was no lack of qualification for McCain's economic ideas of excesses.
In an interview given to the ABC channel, McCain said: "We will all have a pain in swallowing it (...) but nothing to do is a way."
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal mentions the creation of a Treasury Board of Control and the capping of senior management's starting allowances, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill on Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The camp on the right is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - that is how Der Spiegel evokes the low USC score in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
In the online edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers".
According to this renowned polytologist, the CSU erosion began well before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took up its duties.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now, these same modern citizens turn their backs.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of the whole of Christian democracy, and thus also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to come to an end, just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was picking up with 47.7 percent, and this was the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devoting its parents", which is set up in the region in a manner consistent with the USC.
For 40 years, sociologists have announced this, but they have been heavily wrong about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans from the north and east in the region of Bavaria, which is developing, could not remain without consequence of the loyalty of the electors CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The camp on the right is intact, it's only inside the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more header.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks it is precisely the groups of classic citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as independents, artisans, bach owners and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for the CSU has declined below 40 per cent.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who ? With whom ? The presidents of the party stand on the reservation to the issues of the coalition", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the Conservatives of the ÖVP.
ÖVP forbids SPÖ to interfere in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, everything now revolves around the coalition; during the debates organized on public television, party leaders have hardly let their cards meet.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Multerer, the current President of the ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor, remains open by Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer has responded with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to get involved in ÖVP's internal affairs.
In its party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is at the moment a very open question, which must be discussed in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the red and black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," said Haider.
Jéróka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken.
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, whose host is France, began in Paris as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In his message before the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz Popular Party, drew attention to the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the right that affects Roma children most and thus, one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil bodies, in the area of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MP Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions found during hirings, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualification.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of elementary education of poor quality, only a small part of the possibility of obtaining a higher education degree."
Jéróka also stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in asserting other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of the European Union member countries.
According to the European Parliament, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in a widest possible circle, also between the Roma and non-Romans.
In fact, the earlier a Roma child begins school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"By their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low-quality and sectarian education." - Lívia Járóka said.
According to the honourable Member, cooperation from the European Union towards an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of de-regregation of schools, and for this, compliance with the existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and the possibility of democracy must be given to Roma children so that they can participate as citizens of full right to the future of Europe" demanded Jéróka.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the goal of the Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe held every year from the summit in Berlin last year is to ensure a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: grace for a transition period
The decision on the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo dechu will be taken in October.
Despite this lousy election failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been adjourned.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 per cent, will be on the agenda of the convention of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, in any case, felt that they did not especially keep their seats.
As a result, they worked to soothe the angry members of the fraction and the base, which one day after the "Tsunami Bavarian" required personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still count heavily in this region of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reform of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, who was presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a seat in this modest group of recognition, which initiates talks with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, trained along the right-hand values, about a possible coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange nose of fate was that, using the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislation, whose action against Stroiber was used as the possibility of puttingsch perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then to deal without home the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far drew the straps in the backs, will also be given an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed on 28 September as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some bitter remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be a chancellor if they are re-established in one way or another, with a common force, the USC, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by fiasco, the loss of CSU land will not negatively influence the great coalition of Berlin.
However, this is relative because it will not be easier to manage the wounded USC, and the socio-democratic crisis will still last.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko’s rivals: 110 - 0
No member of the opposition has acceded to the Belarusian parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which provides him with prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegalities committed during the removal of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been very opposed for decades, prior to yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as President for the fourth time in dubious elections, on the traces of the amendment of the constitution in 2006, would "allow" this time the presence of a few Members of the opposition to parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians who did not receive an entry visa, was one of the opposition's expectations. Belarus had to take credit because of the ever more expensive decrease in imports of Russian natural gas, and thus contributed to the passage of Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines across the country, has passed to the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the prohibition of a third of the candidates to the opposition, referred to a prior calming.
However, the OSCE communiqué on Monday had already challenged the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were taken.
Despite all this, the opposition is still a tangible improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories for a month already.
"We have made two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevitch to our newspaper.
According to the candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this parliament which has no weight, to have even one opponent come in".
The opposition does not include protest actions in the light of the results; rather, it tries to send its message on the need for economic reforms to electors.
"Of course, we have a lot of concern on this side: we need to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us on the wheel for the dissemination, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of older people," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported retirees does not really consider it appropriate anymore.
"Because of the debt of the country and the rise in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'repeating the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," says Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have qualified the democratic elections.
Serguei Lebedev, the head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had no turning doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But from today, this new measure is in force against small machines, against which points and then drinks coffee at the bar during working hours.
Today, the anti-favoring novelty was presented by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The turning doors- says Brunetta- are a tool for better working, with more productivity, more presences and more services" said the Minister.
Now a new season of accountability and transparency begins.
"It's about reformism" points out Brunetta.
The installation in all institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is even important from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, the Secretary General says: "This is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests by smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7am in the morning is an excellent and safe resolution".
At a conference at the Superior School of the Public Administration
in Rome, the minister communicates that "in three months, the absence of public employees' illness has decreased by 50%, or 60 thousand workers more than a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "including wage dynamics," explains the Minister- over the past 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined in challenging the norms of Decree Brunetta using Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today extends the data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace because of illness- writes the consumer association- the people of "active workers" continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive Public Administration met to declare the war to the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in cases of disability for reasons of service is challenged; the extension of the hours of the sick worker's home stay, during which inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Crime prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
Inail data confirm in 2007, that the white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures testify to the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
For the attention of the institutions, social forces and the means of information on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents on Labour, institutionalized the second Sunday of October.
"Anmil's worrying data, as well as the tragic events of the past few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention on the workplace," said President Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the ongoing associative effort to prevent accidents at work, to protect injured workers, to assist victims' families and to raise awareness of public opinion"
"naturally indigested, everyone has punched in order to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repeative cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, our attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber pointed out how much this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each one of us, and requires all the institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly."
The data of the accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being even impressive," said the President of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"we do not wish that this "tendence to the downhill" actually translates into a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes, that the tragedy comes.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be made through multiple actions."
"We have emphasized Mercandelli- more checks and inspections are necessary, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added - "it is necessary to make further efforts with regard to communication and awareness of public opinion.
"But above all, greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is needed in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
" Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the expected compensation for the victims of work" and "the result of assistance to which the system has been operating in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to restore the guarantee of insurance to the worker - he added - so that the fate of the one who has an accident, must not depend on the spontaneism or the extension of the legislator"
Mp3 reader pointed to the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for a prolonged period using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent injuries to the hearing.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a press release in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Cssseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report- let's read in the note- it turns out that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day and per week, are at risk of permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones at full volume can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable manner," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to scientific data, the EU is responsible for a clear risk and we must react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise awareness of consumers and make this information public.
We also need to review existing systems of control in view of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientists-conclude the EU Executive - confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100DB, but the concern increases as to hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reduction of levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum level of noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to about 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germano gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we will draw the money.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will develop the directives for Rome.
In March when they have completed, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp " of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Germano.
"The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - it would like to stress Germano - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which will be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Council.
No overlap of roles, but only the desire to have a corner to develop a major project for Rome.
In March, she will have finished her duties and will then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time span.
In June-announcing the mayor- we will present the strategic plan of the work of the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its views will not be binding, Germano replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France, thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am on it, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often the policy is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see from the front, and beyond, towards a deeper prospect, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Germano, in fact, "there is a need for a strategic framework, neither firm nor immovable, in order to enable our city, to improve itself, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit."
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to go independent wrote, "Barack Obama will be the second American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the side of his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he always has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the date of the elections approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: "this person is full of ambition".
Obama is really horrified: he thinks he will win the highest function of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In reality, these are attacks that don't say much; they are of course racial attacks, and they don't answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will give his vote.
This is what emerges from an aspect of American mentality that has been kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things that have never been revealed so far, to the point that the black candidate's success seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
Some 1,500 people were asked: what were Bush's errors during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles and was sent home to her ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weakness.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge stain to accomplish.
U.S.A., the economic downturn even makes itself felt in journalists: in the press, it's time for the suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "murder" of the paper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists were interviewed by the POW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are pessimistic today about their future.
However, they have not openly stated to the information officers, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is an economic model crisis that has been destroyed.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work in the newspaper assembly, are a major problem.
This is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we want traditional journalism as the general public understands it, to be reduced accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses break a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as "the killer" of the newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to putting themselves in technology hoping it "dos something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest catchment in American journalism is among those who run newsrooms - i.e. directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is related to "working security".
Directors who consider losing their jobs within 3 years are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going to 30%.
The one of the "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 million a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "bad" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:COURNAL ROME, DANILLO COPOLA RESTAURANT TO GROTTAFERATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the real estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for banker in the framework of the Unipol-Bnl escalation instruction.
During the trial, last week, he had obtained the mandatory house release in Grottaferrata.
Her lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be able to travel from the city of province to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such travels (which the pm did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to evidence that accuse him.
elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the 700 billion dollar saving plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still, more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms it by telling us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its vigilant East Coast, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to " Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, rightly, which was made to feel rather strongly with the vote I was talking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just an example of the changes, of the great changes that the ongoing economic earthquake anticipates or already allows to run: not only the United States, but throughout the West, and it can be only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomenon covered for some time, so that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and revealing.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary revival, of the dual sovereign state category, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with the outside world, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of people and families living in one country, in one State.
This immediately creates a political problem for who governs it: that is to say, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here nationally.
Political internationalisation seems really out of play or not much to say: the obvious evidence is provided by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide any common political line.
And so, it is the government of each State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and especially credit: when we go through a difficult period, there are only those States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimization to use them: two resources of an invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the state-nation crisis is still in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, as we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-materials, convinced that globalised finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized from one moment that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with the rather low material things such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from place to place, but that are bound in absolute relation to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the evilness of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
Now I come to the second novelty, which however provides for a fracture.
Territoire, State, Government, inevitably says politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have become inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And also, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus, more and more the belief of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far at their level, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
in short, The demand for leadership, undergroundly feeds, a powerful and ramified movement of dellegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in improvised electoral "revolts" or, in the changes of collective moods of the latter all the time, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of workers in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not happen by chance).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say, are still more difficult, which does not give rise to today, to understand and thus to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis reinforces, increases and acts potentially in a way that is far-reaching.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda, seems quite frankly exaggerated.
But it's good to say, keep your eyes wide open, it's not without reason.
The supercolle to walk on the walls.
Win the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 cm square, the researchers managed to hold a 100 kilogram body on a vertical wall.
ETUDE- The U.S. journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a specific structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a spaghetti pile." Explain Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that make it possible to ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Téflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that he "is easily detached from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
MARKET ON THE MURS? –"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps it is, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as connection between electronic devices, since carbon nano tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article of the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian researchers presented an adhesive made of microfibers such as hair, which self-cleans dust during the movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juices.
Attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, mainly consumed in the summer because they are desaliterant and vitamin-rich, if associated with certain vital drugs, alter the absorption amplifying or decreasing as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices that are, in box or fresh, when associated with the intake of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apples, to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, canceling their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticized because it is considered responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, staminal and neurological medicinal products up to toxic levels.
Medicines at Risk- It is the Italian Medicine Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year information bulletin, warning doctors and patients not to assess the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink, if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Longue is the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the Université Publique de Milan: "these findings are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is always appropriate to read the indicative papers of the medicines taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to be clearly addressed to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert pointed out to the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a New Kenyan who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editorialist from the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush's foreign economic and political solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that sparked many polemics, and was blamed on the economist for years, but which has now proved accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive divulner, particularly critical of the excess liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of OpenOffice.org.3.0 broadcast, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to touch more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following an almost a year's work, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: welcome screen, and the revised interface and become less austere, to some more important ones, such as compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid special attention to the interaction with Office 2007 suite and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain functions specific to certain modules, such as that which allows you to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful, for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, preserve the original aspect of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format chart with elements of a spreadsheet or text maker.
Collaboration between several people has been a factor that has had various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over the changes, in the drafting of texts, as each contributor is assigned a colour of comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to carry out certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should produce the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is usually available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation CD may be shipped to or from the place of work.
And if the theme of free entertainment can be a means of spreading it in homes, it is precisely in business, that Open Office will continue to face the great challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Without counting the realities that provide a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word equivalent writing video ; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel ; Impress, for PowerPoint rival presentations ;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases ; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008 to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, you can even exceed the projected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, that's the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber's maillot.
It's the website of the L'Equipe newspaper that reports the news.
At the age of 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's specimens are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positiveness in Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the Third Generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, that he had notified the positive to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus sharpening the peas jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES IS ASKING IF ITALY IS ACTIVATE?
Italy "as a country of migrants has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants" hosted with reluctance.
Would this turn the beautiful country into a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times is about, which devoted a long article debating the theme of racism in Italy, from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the Nordic regions are both those where we register "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support to the Northern League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislation required by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal persons is cited as evidence of the change in climate in Italy.
Trend highlighted by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked that the state and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market has no crisis
According to the latest investigation of Sunia, the renting of a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding the whole categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high global costs that families of origin have to support - because the head of the study office in Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the high demand of students has so distorted the market that a process of generalized increase has even begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a number of violations: free, unregistered contracts, no limit to rent, sub-locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of tax are necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a simple room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Blackband area), at an average value of 800 (Lambate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average bed costs 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the nearby areas of the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a simple room.
In Rome, in the areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are required for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double.
slightly lower values (550 euros for a simple) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
It can only be saved if you move away from the peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed, and 450 for a simple one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, there must be 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the citadine economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra community students, have a subsequent abnormality: the rent required for foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Adieu old cinema Paradiso, the cities elect the historic halls.
Historical cinemas are closing in for the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind town, it's like a blind face"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the great Italian urban centres, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalizing cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of the great multi-layers, and the death of consumption of the mono-rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems to us inevitable and unquestionable; in addition, it has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historic places full of memory, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of path and so many emotions" observes the stagemaker of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and who told the poetry of a province hall, and the nostalgia of a way to live the cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the leading association of merchants, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that have paid mainly the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, Emilie Romaine is leading 82 single cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirming that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multisalle cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy over the past five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed in an irrational way" observes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it is also necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a farm room in a city, these visitors are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of credit for traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the sector, between €16 million and €18 million are needed per year.
Let us note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono rooms of historic and periphery centers.
Among the proposed regulations, there are tax facilities for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and in some parking spaces.
"It's an initiative that pleases" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
However, it is clear that, in contrast to the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" to which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have had so many shared emotions, I turn from the other side not to see the black panels through the dust.
Links between politics and ‘drangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to standardize the mayor's choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy charges are brought by the magistrates of the Calabre Antimafia Directorate, to the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The handles also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his young lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted for association of mafia-type villains, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"a fight against legal and moral norms, and especially good sense," wrote the prosecutors, both local governments had expressed the desire to pay for consultations with Master Piromalli.
"In this way, we would have been given to the clan - writing the judges - to officially enter the mayors, facilitating the opportunities, already considerable, of control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian Regional Committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "columns between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of drangheta, heroes who are honest."
The arrests this morning followed last July, after which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a right centre coalition, after the May 2006 ballotage.
He called the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the vice minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, the accused of having handled everything for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in asking for the variation of the project of the A3.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm wrote, emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more known group, close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy comes from waves, the big ones are now launching.
This is a disproportionate deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the major global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now they're trying to get their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied hundreds of years ago, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When oil prices dropped around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the ecological bodies and the new increase in oil give rise to the sector
The London World Energy Council (WEC) in 2007 estimated that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by ocean houle operating systems.
This would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be the currents and tides..
Colosses in the attack.
The first marine energy undertaking was Enerssis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, we would have said a genuine revolutionary step.
At two years of this, more and more candidates among these companies that have always been dedicated to traditional energy focus on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said the spokesperson of a company associated with the American oil colosse, the economic daily Wall Street Journal, and it assesses the possibilities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a licence from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a project to operate marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that precisely in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travel the way of energy from the sea, and the sums invested so far, although their details are not known, indicate, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology still at the beginning, on the one hand, that marine energy does not dispel fears of environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a major problem in the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technologies must be used with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave push, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure drives a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through cables under the seas.
For now, we have four systems of this type at the project stage, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking space using six turbines under marines from the East River of New York.
The movement of water during tides, rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced to have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, deserves at the moment the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely about the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the shores, invested $7 million and a half dollars in 2008 and plan to invest up to 35 million in 2009.
