White pedone to f3, black pedone to e6, white pedone to g4, black woman to h4 - black chess! This is jokingly indicated in the chess circles as "study".
White: Tower in a1, pedone in b6, king in c8. Black: pedone in a7 and b7, king in a8, alfie in b8. The White puts the opponent in zugzwang playing the tower in a6, after which the Nero has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move its alfie in any other check on diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the White makes advance its pedone from b6 to b7 and gives boot. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pedone in a7, with the same result.
