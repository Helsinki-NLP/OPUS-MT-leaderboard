Do you feel any other symptoms?
Have you ever felt assailed?
Do you still feel chest pain?
'Cause it's a flu season.
But it is also true that we should not put aside the chest pains that come from the heart.
But the most important problem right now is this chest pain.
And I'm having trouble breathing.
But I knew that many people were coughing at me.
But we need to deal with every chest pain very seriously.
But now you can breathe well?
I really forgot the cause of this chest pain.

Cumulative coronavirus (COVID-19) disease that is increasing rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and United Kingdom, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incidents in the case of coronavirus (COVID-19) show similar trains in the United States of Europe/European Economics and English Raya, which confirms that, despite different stages depending on country, the COVID-19 pandemic develops very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care unit, it should increase its capacity for implanting the CVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a classer case of pneumonia with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Control and Disease Control of the Tiokok disease reported that this disease's kausatif agent was a new coronavirus now called a heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80% of COVID-19 patients suffer from mild illness, which is respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, with most of them recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 developed into a more severe disease and needed hospital care, while 6% of other cases had a critical illness requiring intensive care.
Mortality of patients treated in the hospital due to COVID-19 approximately 4%.
In this study, we analyzed the COVID-19-United States cumulative train in Europe/EU/EEA and UK and compared it with the incident in the Hubei Province of Tiokok.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases currently in the EU/EEA and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 has been geographically distributed further and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemics in other parts of the world are currently following the pandemic dynamics in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
At Eurosurveillance 2020, the March 5th, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with the case of COVID-19 confirmed on the basis of WHO case definitions.
In the EU/EEA, three confirmed cases were first reported by France on January 24, 2020 to those who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Turkey.
On 15 March 2020, the case of COVID-19 has been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and Ingris Raya (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with the date included 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents in the COVID-19 case
At the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in every country around the world is updated every day at 8.00. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the State Health Ministry, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess the COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare it with the train in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we counted the cumulative incident 14 days ago, so calculated the natural voyage of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and UK, in the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported in each country until March 15, 2020 at 8.00 compared to the case in Italy during the period January 31–15March 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
The cumulative train occurred 14 days ago in the EU/EEA and the UK generally follow the train in the Hubei Province (Tiokkok) (Gandrum 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative COVID-19 incident began to rise about February 21, and then increased to about February 28, 2020.
This train is primarily driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and UK show similar cumulative COVID-19 increase (additional).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period January 31–15 March 2020.
The data suggested that, until March 15th at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases equal to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
A train observed at the COVID-19 cumulative incident indicates that the pandemic is increasing at a speed equal to that of all countries.
This is apart from the differences in the stages of the countries, the various health responses to society, and the possible differences in the definition of the case between countries and the protocols to choose the patients to be tested for the COVID-19 confirmation, which includes the assessment of sentencing.
Early in March 2020, physicians in the affected Italian region explained the situation of about 10% patients of COVID-19 required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in this region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 case receipt data in the hospital and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA level are only available for each 6% and 1% cases (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
Studies carried out in the year 2010-2011 showed a wide range in the availability of intensive care beds and the treatment of Madya in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 populations in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and Madya treatment per 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
Health care capacity-related modelling scenario, with a prevalence estimate of the COVID-19 case inappropriate for each EU/EEA country and the UK that relates to risk >90% exceed the capacity of intensive care bed, provided at the sixth ECDC rapid risk assessment of CVID-19.
Because so far a case is classified in a particular region in the EU/EEA and the UK, and a hospital and intensive care units usually serve a specific regional care coverage population, information about a case and an intensive care bed should be provided at the level of the Unit of the Territory for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and the current train in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic develops very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, the state, hospital, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of patients COVID-19 requiring health care, especially intensive care, such as in the affected region of Italy.
As shown in recent ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive, and comprehensive approach is very important to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from the mitigation approach to the mitigation approach, because a rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give enough time to decision makers and hospital to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if it is not previously applied.
The rapid risk assessment also summarizes public health steps to increase the impact of pandemics.
A short window of opportunity is available when the country has the possibility to increase its control efforts in slowing down SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEA health care system is likely to face the surgeries of patients who need intensive care in a few days or weeks to come.
A coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, which has caused human disaster.
Similar to the homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause symptoms similar to similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower level of depravity and mortality than SARS, but more contagious and older than young people, and more on men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about this emerging disease, this article tries to give timely and comprehensive consideration to the rapidly growing research subjects.
We're going to discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Semi Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all the Tionghoa people who have been told to stay at home for the holidays and weeks after the outbreak of a new virus.
The virus is a very homologous with coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, this virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it caused was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemics began in Wuhan, Tiokkok, and rapidly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients released and 3,000 patients died in the world.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "enemy number 1" and potentially damaging more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that establishes a sequence of viruses isolated from some patients, more than 200 have been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This study seeks to shape research into this fast - growing new subject.
As possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, which is Middle Eastern Breath syndrome (MERS, plague in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis as well as some other unanswered questions but urgent ones.
According to tradition, the CoV is considered non-lethal pathogen for humans, especially causing about 15% gain 4.
However, in this century, we have found the CoV that is highly pathogenic to humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each of them causing the first outbreaks in Tyogkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with morbidity and terrible mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third CoV plague in human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, a classification of pneumonia with unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of China.
Seven days later, a CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, epidemics spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the health care provider's infection was reported, which indicates that human-human transmission may occur.
On January 23rd, forty - three districts were held in Wuhan city and all public transport was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of this disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients were directly involved in the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the initial location of infections from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this plague an emergency of global health.
By the time the report was written, the disease has spread to all of Tiokkok and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).
Because of the rapid development of the situation, the final coverage and severity of the plague still need to be established.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following more up-to-date epidemic images (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people over 50 years of age, only a few under 20 years of age, and only 14 infected people under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expanded in a classer, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from alert to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7,2) days.
The average time from alert to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Base reproductive numbers (R0) are 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, according to mass transport time before the Semi Festival in Tiogkok.
Mortality patients in confirmed cases of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the most appropriate mortality for all patients of 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COPID-19 are gender, age ≥ 60, and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large-completed subfamily of the virus that contains single RNA sense butter.
CoV can be divided into four genes, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein tonjolan or spike (S) connects to his cell receptor, enzyme angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) and peptide 4 (DPP4) peptide peptides, each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The genom RNA virus is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the virus genome, the genomic RNA is accompanied by glycoprotein sampul and nucleopapsid proteins form vesicles containing virion, which then undergo fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta-CoV type with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% of the 10 samples administered; the sample was taken from the outbreak's location, the Juanan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through electron microscope transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in the epithelium of very thin human respiratory tract.
ACE2 humans were found as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S SARS-CoV-2 protein is related to human ACE2 weaker than its binding with S SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 caused non-separate SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new, encrypted short protein with an orf3b and a secret protein with an orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in virus pathogenesis and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not have a functional domain or a known motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure in resolution 2.9 and in complex with the transporter of amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformation, is made up of amer and ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which are evidence for the recognition and infection of the CoV.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in the drug coating to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original ring and middle
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each is transmitted to humans through musks and camels.
Using the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic comparison with other CoV, bats are considered the original SARS-CoV-2 because of this new virus 96% identical with two SARS-like CoVs of a bat called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, an intercessor that helps virus cross species barriers to human infection is still unknown, and transmission routes still need to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed snakes as a carrier of viruses from bats to humans who involved homologous recombination in S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Tiokkok, suggest that grinding, mammals congested long ants that are commonly used in traditional Tionghoa drugs, potentially as an intermediate saRS-CoV-2 ring based on 99% genetic homology of the coV found in tingling and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the differences spread across the genome are still a big difference; therefore, the conclusive results as evidence are still unreachable.
Most of the physical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar qualities.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to ultraviolet and hot light at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfection containing chlorine, asymmetric acid, chloroform, and other fat processors, but not chlorohexidine, effective disabling viruses.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and because it is vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study reporting on immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another research of CoV before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
Generally, after invasion of the anang, virus is identified by a built-in immune system through a pattern receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receiver, Toll-like receiver (TLR), NOD-like receiver (NLR), and RIG-I-like receiver (RLR).
Through different pathways, viruses bend the expression inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and interferon synthesis type I (IFN) that restricts the spread of the virus and accelerates antigen phagosis by the macrophag.
However, N protein in SARS-CoV can help virus avoid immune response.
Soon, adaptive immune response became part of the fight against this virus.
T-lymphosite, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to viruses, and CD8+ T cells kill directly infected cells.
The T-cell helps produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, the CoV can slow down the function of T-cells by subduing apoptosis of T-cells.
Humoral immunity, which includes complexes, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in combating virus infections.
For example, the antibodies isolated from patients who have recovered neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce a large number of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case, failure to the organs of the mosquitoes and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is marked with an acute grader, more about the age of a rapist and pregnant woman.
Generally, people who are found viruses in large numbers or who are disturbed by their immune function have a higher chance of infection than others.
Estimation of the average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies against 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as explained above, show that the 4.8 incubation period (3.0-7,2) is based on demography 8,866 cases.
It is of utmost importance that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine period based on the most accurate incubation period so that people who are infected are prevented, but without symptoms, from transmitting viruses to others.
As a general practice, people who are exposed to viruses or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptoms of COVID-19, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, breathing, muscle pain, lymph, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after illness.
In severe cases, patient disease has rapidly developed into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shocks, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who have fever and/or acute respiratory and fever symptoms, even without a hearing impairment, should be covered against the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that a percentage of 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for hypne, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% patients need ventilator support.
Similar findings are reported in two recent studies, which include studies in family classes and classes caused by transmissions from the asymtomatics.
In contrast, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% patients need ventilation support, much more than the COVID-19 patients and consistent with Mers' mortality higher than the COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and throat pain (21%) are also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat pain (13-25%) were shown as the main symptoms and ventilation support needed for about 14%-20% patients.
Until February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Compared with that, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reaches 6.47 with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV is only about 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in symptoms, mortality, and R0 given in Table 1.
Those numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher capacity to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but does not kill MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemic.
Antuan classer is often found in one family or in one group or vehicle like a cruise ship.
Patients often have a travel history or live in Wuhan or other affected areas or have contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before sunset.
However, it is reported that people can carry viruses without showing symptoms of more than two weeks and patients sent from the hospital can carry viruses again.
At the early stage, patients have normal or decreasing white blood cell counts.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and aspartate aminotransferase and increased viremia were found in 1,099 patients COVID-19.
About heart and muscle enzymes and hemoglobins increase in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive protein and blood levels increase in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels increase, which is the product of fibrous digestion in the blood, and the number of lymphocytes decreases progressively.
Other photos of chests were found in the large number of patients COVID-19 and marked with bilateral shadow or ground-glass opacity in the lung.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occur, inflammation control, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly aggravates the disturbance of gas exchange.
The type I and type II pneumosis function lowers the surface level and increases surface pressure so as to lower the lung's ability to expand and increase the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst finding in chest photos is often parallel to the worst level of disease.
On February 18, 2020, first COVID-19 pathology analysis showed pneumosis, hyalin membrane disintegration, interstitial lymphoside infiltration, and sinsitial cell cored much in the lung that died from this disease, according to the pathology of virus and ARDS infections and similar to the pathology of patients SARS and MERS.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used as the primary criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because of the false negative levels, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer only depends on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is very important and a necessity to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the protocol of the basic SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detected synthetic RNA fragments SARS-CoV-2 in 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using valves within less than one hour without requiring complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly increase sensitivity and ease if verified on the clinical sample.
Because of the lack of experience with new COVs, doctors especially offer supportive care to patients COVID-19, while trying to try various therapies that have never been used or previously proposed for other COV treatments, such as SARS-CoVs, MERS-CoVs, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapy with antiviral, immunosuppressive, steroid, plasma from cured patients, traditional Tionghoa drugs, and psychological support.
Even plasma from a cured patient is suggested for use in therapy.
Pharmacy companies compete to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
At the early stage, SARS-CoV-2, especially attacks on the lungs and may also attack another organ that expresses ACE2 at a lower level, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
But dysfunction and failure to breathe are a major threat to patients and major causes of death.
Therefore, breathing support is very important to relieve symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of disease.
Patients with heavy breathing symptoms should be supported by the oxygenation of the extrakoporeum membrane (ECMO), which is the thermodifying kardiopulmoner shortcut technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening breathing.
In addition, maintenance of electrolytes, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, and protection of vital organ function is also important for patients SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune system reaction is known to cause cytokine storms on SARS and MERS patients.
The sitokin storm is a systemic inflammatory response that is marked by a segregated segregated decation of the segregated sitekin, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN, and MCP-1.
These cytokines subjugate immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the primary cause of ARDS and fail the mucus organ.
Immunosuppression is very important in the management of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Korticosteroid and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monochlonal antibody, has been used to handle cytokine storm.
Another immunosuppression for cytokine storm includes modulation of immune response that is transmitted to T cells; removal of IFN-', IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; detection of cytokine signals 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroid, as an immunosuppressant, is widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are useless for severe lung injury to SARS and CVID-19 patients.
Instead, steroids can cause heavy side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which greatly affects prognosis.
However, short corticosteroid delivery at low doses is being encouraged to be carefully given to patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.
At the time of writing this review, no effective anti-virus therapy has been confirmed.
However, an intravenous rendesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found in a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Remdesivir was a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of disease caused by the Ebola virus and Marlburg.
In recent years, rendesivir also shows inhibition of other single-cooked RNA virus, which includes the MERS and SARS virus.
In view of this, Gilead provided this compound for Tiokkok to do a series of tests on the infected SARS-CoV-2, and the outcome was highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin has been recommended as a potential therapy for patients with acute breathing symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, heart damage, and other side reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
This treatment interaction with other drugs that patients use should be monitored accurately.
Plasma from a cured patient and anti-bodi-producing
There is a long history of a patient's blood collection that has been cured from a contagious disease to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from suffering the disease.
True, a cured patient often has a relatively high level of antibodies in his blood.
Antibodi is immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize the unique molecules on the pathogen, and directly neutralize it.
Based on this, the plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 patients who were seriously ill.
Their symptoms improve in 24 hours, accompanied by lower inflammation and weight of the virus and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification need to be done to submit such a method for large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
Further, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma-related deficiencies should be considered accurately.
For example, antibodies can stimulate excessive immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
Concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low and plasma is widely needed to treat a chronically ill patient.
Specific development and production of antibodies is fast enough to fight global epidemics.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and to identify the genetic code that fuels effective antibodies or to filter effective antibodies against proteins that are important to viruses.
In this way, we can easily increase the production scale of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tiokkok for thousands of years.
However, the effect largely depends on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula differs depending on the diagnosis of disease based on the TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify these components or the optimal combination.
Currently, since effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 has not yet been available, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms until now or for people who recover from a serious illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du's capsule and Lian Hua Qing Wen's capsule were found to be spelled out for COVID-19 therapy.
The highest level of treatment in patients with COVID-19 was observed in some provinces of TCM in the TCM in 87% of the patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei, who used TCM only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, had a lower level (13%).
However, this comparison is still very harsh because of the many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, that should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends published a study that compared western drug therapy (WM) only with WM and TCM combined therapy.
They found that the time it took for the recovery of the body temperature, the loss of symptoms, and the ina much shorter rate for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
More impressive, the reduction in symptoms (from light to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and lower mortality in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, effectiveness and safety TCM are still waiting for better controlled testing on a larger scale and at more research center.
The other interesting thing is specifying the working mechanism and clarifying the effective components in the CTM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most of the patients suspected or confirmed COVID-19 feel very scared of the very contagious and even deadly disease, and those who are quarantined also feel boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Further, such infections as fever, hypoxia, and cough and side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroid can cause greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early phase of SARS, a series of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor symptoms, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicideists have been reported.
Contact records and quarantine mandatory, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 plague, can make people more worried and feel guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental - health care should be provided for patients of VOCID-19, expected people, and those who interact with them, as well as the needy public.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multi-discipline mental health team, clear communication with a routine update and accurate on SARS-CoV-2 plague, and a therapeutic plan and use of professional devices and electronic applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are very important to cut the chain of transmissions from animal and human reservoirs infected with vulnerable ants and are often equipped with antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by virus outbreaks.
The effort has been made to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which is long-term and effective in making the antibodies penetrate and/or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, life-consuming vaccines have been evaluated on experimental animals.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of this vaccine in the age and model of the lethal challenge and its protection against zoonotic virus infections still has to be determined before clinical studies begin.
It's probably because SARS cut off 17 years ago and there's no new case reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and the Mers classer continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas because there is still a zoonotic source in the endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using a virus that is disabled, plasmid DNA, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and protein-recombination subunits, and some have been evaluated on experimental animals.
Vaccination development against safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to cope with due to a long time to develop vaccines (almost 18 months) and dynamic VOCs.
As a new disease, the COVID-19 has just begun to show a full clinical trip to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover without a single stroke.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the development of disease prognosis models is vital for health care to prioritize the service, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can affect or be associated with patients' prognosis COVID-19 (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 especially occurred at 30-65 years of age with 47.7% patients over 50 years of age in studies with 8,866 cases as explained above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have drug abuse and complications and significantly older age than patients who do not need intensive care (the measure 66 years of age rather than 51 years), which conditions age as a prognostic factor for the end result of COVID-19 patients.
Type of sex: SARS-CoV-2 more infected men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Komorbiditas and complications: COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events also mentioned the main cause of death on SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be linked to a colonyositis with ACE2-positive, which can result in heart dysfunction in the COVID-19 patients.
Note that underlying age and disease are highly interrelated and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects inflammation or tissue injury and is proposed as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between the CRP levels and the complexity and the COVID-19 prognosis has also been suggested.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and heart dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: Foto thoracs and development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered together with other things to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid usage: As explained above, steroids are immunosuppressives that are widely used as an infection therapy for infections to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors of this disease eventually suffer from avascular osteocrosis with life-long disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and short-term rates on patients of COVID-19.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 plague, many patients suffer tremendous stress because they have to go through long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and watch the death of close family members and their fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be provided to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to applying in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at the early stage of infection, similar to the other coVs that cause seizures.
Therefore, at the early stage or incubation stage, infected patients can produce a large number of viruses during daily activity, causing major difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most of them do not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 disease is far worse and difficult to control than the SARS plague.
At present, major efforts are being made in Tiokok, which includes forty Wuhan and cities around and quarantine continues almost all populations with the hope of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Even though this has been a major economic and other sectors in the country, the number of patients has decreased, indicating the spread of epidemics.
The most optimistic estimate indicates the plague will end in March and the decline phase will last for 3-4 months.
Some, though, were not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be far more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
The research group of Canada reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-conka and cured patient throats and returned from the hospital two weeks earlier. This indicates that the newly identified virus can be repeated episodes, similar to influenza.
Even so, the promising signs happen in Tiokkok, if seen on the basis of the decline in the number of new cases, which indicates that the current strategy might be successful.
Ebola is predicted to cause one million cases with half death as well.
However, with quarantine and tight isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Might also, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus that is not too pathogenic to be associated with humans.
The COVID-19 epidemics were compared with the SARS and MERS epidemics listed below.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through cough or sneeze, and it may also be through direct contact with substances contaminated by viruses.
This virus was also found in fesses so it could trigger a new transmission, which is a fast-to-mouth transmission.
Recent studies in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 patients with health care.
Therefore, proper precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who have an accident encounter with patients or infected individuals.
The first defense line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both the scalp and the N95 respiratory masks (the 1860s series number) help control the spread of the virus.
The surgeons make sure that the sparks of those who are potentially infected are not attached to the air or attach them to the material surface, which can continue to be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 (the 1860-year series) masks that can protect against inhalation of virion with a minimum of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can fully power; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of which are about 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate even five surgical masks that are cultivated as one, the provider of direct health care with patients should wear N95 (the 1860s series number) and not a surgical mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolation clothing to reduce virus contact.
Virus can also infect someone with eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore N95 masks; a virus might enter his body through an eye patch.
Therefore, the provider of health care should also wear a facial scarf or eyeglasses while working with patients.
For public communities in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfected soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for independent quarantine, and avoid contact with people who are potentially infected.
Three feet are believed to be suitable for keeping a patient's distance.
These actions are an effective method to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a major warning to the Chinese that has strong memories of SARS 2003 plague.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center calmed the population by saying that this new virus had a low quality of preaching and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and prevention and control of the disease was not a problem.
This message is very reassuring to the public, especially as the whole country is preparing the Semi-Semi Festival, so that this critical time has passed to stem a still small disease in Wuhan.
The disease control body in Turkey should learn from this and make great improvements in the future.
For example, this body should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the people and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to non-normal information from the clinic than waiting for official reports from the doctors or authorized officers; (3) more restricted to shield the potential of the epidemic at the early stage, and not trying to calm the public; and (4) more often exercise the target and effective training to increase public awareness of disease epidemics and test and increase the system of public response on a regular basis.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that started to leak in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout Turkey and over 50 countries in the world at the time of this review.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak is re-emerging.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important for developing an epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 is more about the age of young people and more about men than women, and the degree of death is also higher than that of young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
The COVID-19 patient transmits the virus even when they are without symptoms, while the SARS patient usually transmits the virus when they are seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to block the COVID-19 spread compared to the SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
The routine RNA to check SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results to some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, a cured patient can give a further positive result to a virus examination.
This finding clearly posed a real risk to the spread of viruses.
With the rapid progress of the COVID-19 research, some important problems still need to be solved, namely:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although genetic homology is 96% found between SARS-CoV-2 and two similar-SARS bat CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal is being an intermediate species to implement the virus from the original angel, tell the bat, to humans?
Without knowing the answer to numbers 1 and 2, we can't send transmissions effectively and the plague can shoot back at any time.
Although molecular modelling and high biochemistry show that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the airstream cell and leads to subsequent pathology changes?
Is this virus also related to cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic take?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Is this pandemic going to be a global pandemic, end up like SARS, or repeat periodically like the flu?
The answers to the questions above and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
Even so, at any cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
Human Crown Virus Zoonotic Assal
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved co-evolutions of the co-evolution of the corona virus (CoV) and its amber, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCVs) were known to cause mild disease, such as selema.
Serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverse the situation and reveal how much HCoV infection can be extremely damaging and threatening the soul.
His appearance SARS-CoV-2 in central Turkey at the end of 2019 has made COV a re-sort and startle us with a high transmission, but with a lower pathogenicity compared to his brother SARS-CoV.
HCOV infection is a zoonoses, because of that, the understanding of the origin of HCOV zoonotics will benefit us.
Most of HCoVs come from bats, and in this animal, the virus is not pathogenic.
Some HCoV intermediate reservoirs have also been known.
The identification of animals has a direct involvement in prevention of human disease.
The investigation of coV-inang interactions on animals can also give important insights into the pathogenesis of coV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the current general knowledge of seven HCoVs, focusing on his findings and his zoootic origins and the transmission of his interspecies.
What is important is that we compare and transmit the HCoV from the perspective of evolution and genome recognition.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, successful swallowing conditions and the involvement of virus evolution in disease disorders are also popularized.
Corona virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of RNA viruses lining up, positive indrants, and single sparks.
This virus has the largest genome with a size of 26 to 32 kilobes between RNA viruses called "CoV", because its morphology resembles the crown under electron microscopes.
Based on the structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar definition.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large open rows (ORF1a and ORF1b) which overlap each other. Both are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replica polyprotein.
Polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of open bibles (ORFs) for structural proteins, which include towels or spikes (S), tubes or envelopes (E), membranes (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific complete proteins for specific offspring are also characterized by various lines of coV offspring.
Based on differences in protein sequence, CoV is classified as four gene (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among those four gene, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCV and is divided into four gene lines (A, B, C, and D).
The phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and predators are a source of the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV gene, while ungas are the main gamma-CoV and delta-CoV reservoir.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
So far, there are seven known coV humans.
Among the seven viruses, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, a heavy acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), a central eastern respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as pellets and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing infections of heavy lower respiratory tract on relative to more patients and have a higher chance to develop into acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lungs.
Strain HCoV-229E first, B814, is isolated from the ingus of the last patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through a thorough study of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both of which have caused symptoms of recovery.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCOV infection is generally harmless, until SARS outbreak occurs.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most destructive plague in today's history, which infects more than 8,000 people with a gross death toll of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spreads to other parts of the world.
New 2019 HCOV (2019-nCoV), next called SARS-CoV-2, is a state-of-the-art patient of the 2019 COVID-19 virus epidemic, which has taken lives more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world has to prepare itself for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Those seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins from bats, rats, or pets.
Many evidence supports the origin of the evolution of all HCoVs from bats. In bats, CoVs are well adapted and nonpathogenic, but show great genetic authenticity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has created tremendous challenges for the medical, scientific, social, and morals of the world.
The tracking of HCoV zoonotic origin gives the work frame to understand the natural history, the driving force, and the limiting factor is that of inter-species displacement.
This study can also guide or facilitate the search for an animal reservoir, internavigator, and SARS-CoV-2 amplification, which has important implications in future precaution.
In this review, we give a general picture of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenosis.
We particularly recommend and discuss the general topic that HCoV's parent virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but it becomes pathogenic after the transmission of interspecies to the new anang.
We also review the HCoV evolution train that transmission capacity increases often accompanied by the reduction of pathogenicity.
The final result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the first HCoV-229E strain B814 is isolated from the intrusion of the diseased patients, various CoVs have been isolated from infected animals, which include turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In some of the last bases, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in the chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
Strain HCoV-229E was first isolated from the patient's respiratory tract that had an upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to be formed on the course of the WI-38 lung cell.
HCoV-229E infected patients showed symptoms of fever, which included headaches, sinus, lesus, and throat pain, followed by fever and cough seen in 10~20% cases.
Next, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and serial sequences in the brains that were still flowing.
Clinical HCoV-OC43 infections seem to be similar to HCoV-229E infections, which cannot be compared to other respiratory infections such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are spread around the world and tend to be most broadcast during the winter in the current climate.
Usually, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by illness for about two weeks.
On the basis of a human volunteer study, a mildly ill-treated health suffer from HCoV-229E.
Just a little patient with a weakened body immune system that shows a low-fat respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "Atypical Pneumonia", is a pandemic of the first HCoV documented well in human history and its ethiological agents are SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first case SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, in China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spread in many countries and continents.
Apart from the superintendent, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation time of 4 to 7 days and a peak of the virus burden seen on the 10th day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV were initially suffering from myalgia, headaches, fevers, nausea, and choking, followed by dyspnea, coughing, and respiratory disorders as further symptoms.
Limphopenia, unusual heart tests, and kinase-creatin enhancements are a labyrinth that is common in SARS.
The damage to alveolar diffusion, the proliferation of epithel cells, and the increase of macrophage is also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include gastrointestinal channels, hearts, and kidneys can also be infected in heavy cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can cause death, especially in patients with a weak condition.
Virus was first isolated from open-air lung biopsy by a zero patient traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been made to study HCoV.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially very common in young children, older people, and patients with disabilities who were suffering from respiratory disease.
Coriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronkiolitis are commonly found in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation from an eight-month-old male nasal specimen suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Despite being identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of the general respiratory disease and its peak occurred at the beginning of summer, spring, and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called a body.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from 71-year-olds who had been treated for pneumonia and bronchiolytics in Hong Kong.
Besides pneumonia and community bronchiolytics, HCOV-HKU1 is reported related to acute asthma.
Similar to HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
The four HCoVs of this whole community have been adapted with humans and generally have a small possibility of mutating into a highly pathogenic disease. However, the unusual case is for unknown reasons, as in the case of the recently reported HCoV-NL63 subtypes of HCOV63 more virulent caused infections of the lower-duty airway in China.
In general, when the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself within humans, these HCOV virulence and pathogens are also diminished.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from 60-year-old lung patients with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most cases confirmed labs come from the Middle East, the case of importation with a time of secondary contact has been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical manifestation is similar to the SARS clinical manifestation, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also suffered acute kidney failure, which so far has only occurred in MERS among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases of labs have been reported with high case deaths, which is 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most terrifying viruses known to humans.
In mid-December 2019, a respective patient's cluster of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Turkey.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the ongoing low-water infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a global health emergency and named the COVID-19 disease.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the death toll of a rough case of 3.4%.
It needs to be recorded, the death of the case in Hubei, Tiokkok, is 4.2%, while the death of the case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 caused heavy respiratory infection like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a fever, cough, and breathing disorder.
Diare is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory disorder.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of high nucleotide sequence homology, of 82%, they both flock to a different phylogenetic tree branch.
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is clearly lower, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subject infected SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms has been reported and may play a role in the fast SARS-CoV-2 spread around the world.
Compared and distinguished SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs show a very interesting similarity and difference.
First, the incubation and duration of travel of HCOV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows another six-HCoV general train.
Second, COVID-19 is found between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (like HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of HCoV infection in the Community, which includes a mild or even unspecific symptom.
On the other hand, a small number of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infections, although with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting patterns, having similarities with both HCOV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmission capabilities are at least as high as HCOV in the community.
On the other hand, decreasing the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 transmission after some lines in humans still needs to be verified, as does SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a phase sample.
"Is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in a particular situation, it still needs to be clarified by the next study."
Also important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of HCOV community.
However, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmission capabilities, pathogenicity, and continuous circulation in several pathways in humans, will have a strong impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
Four communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be HCoV control species in ancient times.
HCOVs that cause serious illness on humans and humans who experience severe HCOVs have died.
In order for this to happen, HCOV must replicate in humans in sufficient amounts to allow for adaptive mutations to be accumulated against the weight of abduction factor.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 disease survives and more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to be fully adapted with humans.
If the virus is well adapted, transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
Over the years, four CoV communities have moved into the human population and have triggered a fever in people with immunocompetence.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are highly pathogenicly unadapted with humans and their transmissions in humans are unretainable.
Both must defend themselves and engage in zoonotic reservoirs and look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediaries and ramifications.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar image of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit as HCoV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoV and not as pathogenic SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Still to be observed if SARS-CoV-2 is going to adapt fully to humans and it's flowing into humans without a reservoir or an intercom.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary angel, natural, reservoir, internavigator, and HCOV amplification.
Animals act as an evolutionary HCoV for having close relatives and sharing high homologies at the secondary level of nucleotide.
An ancestor virus usually adapts well and is nonpathogenic in this angel.
Likewise, a reservoir carries HCoV over and over again.
In two such cases, an insect is naturally infected and is a natural angel for HCOV or parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV has just entered the middle of the brain right before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus is not adapted to new and often pathogenic.
This intercessor may act as a source of zoonotic human infection and act as a pothole of amplification by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, and then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCOV can have a dead end infection if it cannot maintain transmission in the middle.
On the other hand, HCOV can also be adapted to intermittent angles and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, the middle angel became a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data retrospectively reveals that the case of zero SARS has a history of contact with animals.
Further studies of seroprevalence indicate that these animals have higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
The moon Moses (paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog in the living animal market was the first time identified with similar-sars-coV viruses that were almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Incidentally, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the merchants in the market were killed.
However, it is reported that the moon weasel of wild nature or farm that does not appear to be on the market of living animals gives most of the results of negative testing for SARS-CoV. This indicates that the moon weasel may only act as an intercomplation enemy, but not a natural SARS-CoV resorption.
It needs to be noted, since 80% of the animals in Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it can't be overlooked that many small mammal species may also function as an inter-SARS-CoV fan.
All this amber seems to be the end of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal for SARS-CoV next reveals a close-bred bat COV, which is called a Rhinolopus bat Rhinolopus relatives HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the Tirok horse bat bat.
This cure gives positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and subsequent SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomes.
This CoV and the other CoV bat share nucleotide secondary homology 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study is the foundation for a new concept that bats are an angel for new human pathogens.
Some SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) are also identified from bats, but only one, given the name WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The known angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 from a bat-feses sample is shown to be using ACE2 bats, musks, and humans as a receiver to enter the cells.
Interesting thing, the SARS convalesens serum can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, with a 95% secondary nucleotide homology.
Apart from the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus SARS-CoV and bat is not a direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.
phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as the CoV-HKU4 bat and the CoV-HKU5 bat.
CoV-HKU4 bat and MERS-CoV use the same anang receptor, which is peptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4), as a virus entry route.
The sequence of RNA polymerase depends-RNA MERS-CoV phylogenetically closer to its refinement in the beta-CoV bat identified from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no MERS-CoV lives are found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relatives CoV-HKU25 bat only share 87% secondary nucleotide homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct mers-coV reservoir.
On the other hand, a study in the Middle East showed that Arab butter yields seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like the Middle Eastern camel in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives that are identical to the virus found in humans isolated from the nose of the Arab camel, which indicates further that the camel is a real reservoir for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that mass virus delivery with symptoms that are usually mild to observe on the test camels that are infected with MERS-CoV.
It needs to be noted, the infected camel carries the virus not only through the breathing route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route to the spread of the virus from bat.
However, the question is still not answered because many confirmed MERS cases do not have a record of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, the possibility of human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown species of animals carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with the RaTG13 bat CoV isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to establish parent relationships.
In other words, bats may not be a direct reservoir SARS-CoV-2, except if CoV bats that are almost identical were found later.
Possibly, the SARS-CoV-2 inter-animal animal species are among the wild species sold and killed on the Huanan Sea Sea Food Market. Many cases are initially linked to this market, which indicates the possibility of transmission of animals to men.
Some recent studies based on metanomical sequence show that a group of tiny mammals that are endangered, known as trenggling (javanica manis), may also carry an ancestor beta-coV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new Genom CoV trending shares 85-92% nucleotide secondary homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to RaTG13 with 90% in the nucleotide sequence.
Both are grouped into two sub-line viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-receptor domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a similar amino acid sequence of 97.4%.
Which is striking, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are far more different, although the level of homology is consistent with the entire genome is higher.
A previous study on sick Trengilling also reported a contiguous detection of lung samples, which was also associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted a different method of copying and manual grading to produce a sequence of partial genomes consisting of about 86.3% of complete virus genomes.
We can't rule out the possibility of twitching as one of SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animals.
However, at present there is no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 directly from trinkling because of the secondary difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary path on bats, trinkling, and other mammals still have to be set.
Although the highest secondary homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV patients-SARS-CoV-2 Trenggling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology at the secondary level of the entire genome.
Too speculative if it is said that the level of similarity between the beta-CoV RBD-SARS-CoV-2 kinship-switching and the SARS-CoV-2 is driven by a convergent evolution that is selectively mediated.
The hypotheses of the comparison support the recombination between beta-CoV patient-SARS-CoV-2 Trenggilling and RaTG13 species of third wild animals.
As an evolutionary factor, a lot of recombinations occur between beta-CoVs.
Researchers still can't decide about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 zoonotics.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from bat coV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 parent viruses have been found in the feeder animals.
It is reported that the bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American three-colored bat indicates a close-up to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E genetically related to the other bat CoV, with the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with the alleged Camelidae is also the intertwinor.
To make it clearer, today's knowledge of the origins of HCoV animals that are known to be limited to pictures 1 and Table 2.
phylogenetic analysis has given evidence of HCoV interspecies transmission in history.
In about 1890, when HCOV-OC43 crossed the species of cattle to infect humans, there was a pandemic of respiratory infections.
History of HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is unclear.
Alpha-CoV bats associated with HCOV-229E have been found.
Between them, there's alpha-CoV alpaca.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of viruses from bats to humans.
First, human beings, not alpacas, may be engaged with bats in the ecological shelf together.
On the other hand, humans have a close contact with the alpacas.
Second, alfa-CoV bats associated with HCOV-229E are various and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV alpaca causes respiratory disease to infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the alpaca may have alpha-CoV relatives-HCoV-229E from humans could not be sidetracked.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
Other possibilities, while alpha-CoV bats function as the HCOV-229E gene length, alpaca and Arab camels may function as an intercompanion that transmits viruses to humans, exactly like the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is a very good example for the transmission of interspecies from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The origin of the evolutionary MERS-CoV of the bat was known in the early identification of the virus and was also reinforced by the discovery afterwards.
Clearly, bats are a large length of virus species for the exchange of genetic fragments of interspecies and interspecies transmission.
A long age, a mixed colony, a strong social interaction, and a strong flying capability, all are conditions that support bats to be an ideal 'poor spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in Arabic for decades.
This virus has been adapted with the camel that has changed from the internatoral angus to a stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains relatively low rate of mutation in this animal.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happens by chance and humans remain the ultimate enemy for MERS-CoV because the transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of camels in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of trinkling, if any, in different SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
Especially, the beta-coV is highly pathogenic in tremoring.
Chewing may be an end for beta-CoV relatives SARS-CoV-2, similar to a weasel in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possibilities of an interspecies SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals to humans have to be calculated or subtracted.
First, bats may be a reservoir for a SARS-CoV-2 relative virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological reliefs with bats through the preparation or development of coal.
Second, Trenggiling could be one of the intercomplations for the newly introduced SARS-CoV-2 kin virus.
Humans get viruses through meat processing and consumption of birds.
Maybe, a lot of mammals, which include pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies survey of pets and wildlife needs to be done.
Three, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that are engaged in both bats and trinkling.
Search of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 animals is still ongoing.
Apart from various species of animals, three main factors of the virus side are also important to make it easier to pass through the species barrier.
First, the rate of the relative mutation in RNA replication.
Compared with another single single RNA virus, the rate of CoV mutation can be considered "current" to "high" with the average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per step, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to the new angel.
CoV has an esoribonuklease of corrections, removals that cause very high mutations, attenuations, or even disability.
Interesting thing, Remdesivir nucleotide analogs have been known to suppress CoV replication by inhibiting this exoribunukease and RNA polymerase dependent RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Even so, the rate of CoV mutation is about one million times higher than the rate of the amber mutation.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoV is not adapted to an angel.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high rate of mutation, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, signaling a higher level of adaptation with humans.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to another enemy closely related to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV which has been adapted with Arab camels.
Theoretically, it's unlikely that genetic leaks will quickly make vaccines and anti-virus agents against SARS-CoV-2 become ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoV provides extra flexibility in genom modification, for mutation and recombination, so that it increases the likelihood of co-evolution of interspecies, which is beneficial to appear new co-V under appropriate conditions.
This is supported by a lot of unique open-read patterns and protein functions that are marked to the end of 3′ genome.
Third, the CoV repeatedly replaced the pattern randomly during RNA replication through a unique "choice-salin" mechanism.
In a ring that functions as a mixing vessel, the chewing of the camel often occurs during the RNA CoV transcription.
Full RNA and very homologous subgenomics can experience a recommendation to form a new CoV.
Natural phylogenetic evidence has been found on HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as on coV animals like bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
The interaction of viruses in connection with transmission
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, the interaction of viruses with anang receptor is another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection evidence during the interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and musangs, SARS-CoV is expected to undergo rapid adaptations in various anangs, especially with mutations in S-Protein RBD.
In general, RBD S CoV protein interacts with the receptor cells and is intensively a target of an antibiotic response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is amino acid from 318 to 510 in S1, which is linked to human ACE2 and the co-receptor as a virus entry route.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, musks, mice, and raccoons, allowing transmission of antspecies virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues observed differ between human virus isolates and weasels in RBD and 4 of them located on receptor retention motives for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV mutants have K479N and S487T mutations in their RBD, which may increase the affinity of protein toll interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important to adapt the virus to humans.
It needs to be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receiver as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit involves the affinity of S protein binding with ACE2 humans is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows the affinity of human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV-2 protein 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between ACE2 human and S SARS-CoV protein.
What's also important to know is whether there's any other co-receptor that might be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interesting thing, HCOV-NL63 also relates to ACE2, but to a different part on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptydase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-terasethyl acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after the interspecies transmission of the animal.
In addition to the cell receptor, the end result of the HCoV interspecies transmission is also regulated by the dependency factors and other angle limits.
The difference of this angel's protein between humans and natural reservoir, such as bats, Arab camels, and predatory animals can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCOV has to take over the factors of anang dependency and break down anang retries factor in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular assessors in the area of interacting these important viruses still need to be identified and disclosed.
The layering of the entire genome is impractical to see the dependency and containment factors of SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCOV appearance: return to early outbreak
The bat CoV's familiarity offers a great opportunity for new HCoVs to appear.
In this case, bat CoV functions as a long HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also motivate HCoV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, tracking or losing the genes of new protein supporters may potentially modify phenotype viruses dramatically.
Among the SARS-CoV-accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adapting to humans because of the distant-relative-SARS-CoV virus that is found to contain multiple ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a special trait of 29 nucleotide deletions found on an isolated strain at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation that supports a swing.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with the alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineage, with a large number of smaller areas of recommendation identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, most of them nsp10, and some of them nsp14.
In the same way, the recombination between various lineages occurred in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which took place in Saudi Arabia's Arab camel.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the incident of recombination has also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoV has been recombined with other coV animals in its nonstructural genes.
Also, it should be noted that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from the release of viruses from the selection pressure, such as the immune system.
The example of this effect is the complete ORF4 loss of the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat virus and camel related to HCOV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca indicates a single nucleotide apex that leads to a shift in range.
Finally, new HCoV evolution was also driven by the pressure of selection in his reservoir.
Light or undetected symptoms are detected when the bat is infected with CoV, which shows adaptations between CoV and bats.
Looks like bats fit well with CoVs in anatomy and physiology.
For example, disabling pro-inflammatory responses to bats will effectively lower pathologies initiated by CoV.
In addition, natural killer cell activity on bats is pressed by the rise of the regulation of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 stomp and molecular expression level complex histocompatibilities primary low grade I.
In addition, the high degree of oxygen reactive (ROS) species of high bat metabolic activity can suppress the replication of CoV and influence correction by exoribonukleas so as to give the selection pressure for the creation of a highly pathogenic virus strain when entering a new ring.
The more pathogenic Strain CoV may also develop through recombination, which results in a newly developed protein or protein design for the adaptation of the angus.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in two last stages.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir, such as bats and camels.
CoV is heavily replicated without triggering a strong enemy's immune response.
This is where there's a secret to the absence of symptoms and the cause of a serious human infection.
Especially heavy symptoms because of excessive immune response and cytokine storms, with more severe lung damage if immune response becomes stronger.
On the contrary, on the carrier without symptoms, the immune response has been removed from the CoV replication.
The same strategy for deciding the immune connection might benefit in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response especially strong on bats.
Therefore, the interferon type I gift, at least at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is defective.
For this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be beneficial in the management of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 appearance follows the general direction of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV bats share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, some coV bats share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the weasel and other animals in the market were found to carry an identical virus with SARS-CoV, a direct intermediary for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been found.
Beta-CoV trending a very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which indicates that strangling may play a role as one of the intercompanies or beta-CoVs being able to contribute a gene fraction to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Though still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by humans either intentionally or unintentionally.
CoV is back into the center of attention because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have greatly changed our perceptions about the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoir for HCov on human transmission.
There's a lot of evidence to show that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 came from bats and was transmitted to humans through an intercessor ring.
Considering that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and wetlands in the market, it may be the closure of the wet market and the murder of all the wetlands in it that effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, Trenggiling should be transferred from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of some beta-CoV strains that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism is transmitted to humans through tremoring and other mammals still need to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in Arab camels for a long time.
It works as an important transport tool as well as as as as a main source for meat, milk, skin, and wool products for the local community.
Arab camels spread across the Middle East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all camels to control MERS, as in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS plague, a comprehensive approach must be made to develop vaccines for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control steps.
Before we get rid of this virus, a new genotype can appear and cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs are emerging in the wild.
Especially, coV bats that are potentially zoonotic are very varied.
There are many possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and experience recombinations, which give rise to a new, easier-to-transmitted and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of Turkey must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and development plans must be put into practice.
Actually, a lot of viruses have been on this planet ever since.
These viruses are in his natural reservoir until there's a chance to spread.
Although bats have many features that support the spread of the virus, human opportunities are associated with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are taught to avoid wild animals.
The continuing surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the CoV ecology and its natural anang, which will prove beneficial in preventing the transmission of animals and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the zoonosis of the virus is for humans to keep the distance from the ecologic reservoir of the natural zoonotic virus.
Some parts of SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic puzzles have not been found yet.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2's ancestor viruses to trenggling, the condition when bats and trenggling share ecological elongations is important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans interact with bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as an actual midwife, the way the mammal interacts with another species, which includes humans, bats, and trinkling must be explained.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, either experimental infections and surveillance have to be performed.
Whether bats, twitching, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent virus can be identified in its natural veins in the future.
Further investigation in this field will outline the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathway in animals, with important implications in prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of "expected case" diagnostic criteria and "confirmed case" COVID-19 needs to be done
On 6 February 2020, our team published rapid guidance for the diagnosis and management of new 2019 coronavirus infections (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference to combating pandemics worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasingly based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we answered one comment in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "the expected case" and "confirmed case" based on the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Control for COVID-19 (the seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of the people of Turkey.
In December 2019, the new 2019 (2019-nCoV) corronavirus has caused an outbreak, which is now formally called a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is called a coronavirus heavy akat syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed rapid advice guidelines and the guidelines have been published online at the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
They have been a source of keen interest since they were published.
However, it needs to be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasingly based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Control Guidelines issued by the National Health Commission (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, the Commission has produced a total of seven editions with a large number of contexts.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds to the new evidence for our guidance and makes this a very valuable reference to our worldwide pandemic.
We support their meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also required updating based on the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Handling Guidelines (the seventh test version) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the expected case, it is necessary to combine one of the epidemiological records with two clinical manifestations to perform comprehensive analysis, or to perform three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel history or stay in Wuhan city and area, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) contact history with SARS-CoV-2 case (with positive nuclear assay); (3) contact history with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city and surrounding area, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the wake; (4) contact history with the class of confirmed case (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or breathing symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection imaging features; (3) total white blood count indicates normal lymphocyte counts, decreases, or decreases at early awake stages.
Diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the expected case with one of the pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) positive real-time PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire virus genome shows high homogenity for known new corronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibody changes from negative to positive, or titer increase ≥4 lp at the restoration phase at the acute phase.
We can see that real-time nucleic acid PCR tests in a sample of the air or blood channel added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This modification is based on further research of researchers to find optimal nucleat acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of the respiratory tract including blood collection, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the detection of certain positive antibodies into confirmed criteria.
Moreover, there is more evidence to remind us to keep an eye on the patient with a tidal and no symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s ring chart should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in practice and clinical studies in the future.
In closing, we hope that more immediate evidence will appear and ask readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "expected case" and "confirmed case", we recommend following and following the latest guidance in each country.
Our team will also update our guidance on time as help is needed.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily mortality rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death rate in one day because of the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of reported infections involving 114 active cases and 33 home-based cases.
Totally 17 deaths.
In a news report, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that death included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41 and 50.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of the dead was the Saifur Rahman Road, director of Bengali Anti-Corupsis Commission, who was treated at the Kuwaiti Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a online video announcement, Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, the Quader Oaidul said public transportation would be stopped longer than originally planned, until Saturday.
This public transportation stop has started since March 26th and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4th.
Transportation of basic necessities -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection incident in Bangladesh was on March 8th, with two new returnees from Italy and one of their wives as well.
On March 19, the three men recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronal virus infection SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by a crown virus.
The focus was on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first crown virus infection and Zambia had its first death related to the crown virus.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country was one of the few countries that remained free from the infection of the Crown virus.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Middle European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there are more than 244,000 cases of Crown viruses, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office reports, quoting data from Johns Hopkins University, there are more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by infection of the Crown virus.
All over the world, countries are announcing stricter action to prevent disease spread.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow, extended the forty-fifth of the territory until May 1st.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would remain paid without going to work until April 30th.
The Portuguese Parliament made the takeover of voices to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; it escaped with 215 support voices, ten abstinence voices, and one voice refused.
Saudi Arabia extends the hours of night in the holy city of Mecca and Madinah until the whole day; before, it only occurs between 3:00 and 6:00 p.m.
Thailand plans to apply nighttime between 10 and 4 in the morning.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home until May 1st.
Australia's shop-toko lowers the purchase limit of toilet tissue for transactions
On Sunday and Saturday afternoons, Australia Woolworth and Coles network each lowered the sales limits of toilet tissue to two and one pack per transaction at all stores at the national level.
ALDI also applies the limit of one pack, on Monday.
This limitation was announced as a message in the mailbox and on the network Facebook page.
The buyers are reported to increase supplies due to the fear of COVID-19 if society has to make independent isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for shipments to the house to one pack per order.
This change follows the limitation of four packs per transaction previously applied Woolworths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
In his statement on March 8th, Coles reported that with the restriction of the four packs, "many shops are still running out in an hour since the shipment", and he mentioned that request "had never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unforeseen".
Last week's sharp-up sales, according to one of Woolworths' speakers.
The Costco Store in Canberra also restricted the amount allowed up to two weeks ago.
In order to avoid a shortage, Coles ordered more packaging than a vendor and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while AlDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotion activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, the executive director of Australia's Association of Steels, said that the oil was trying to increase the supply, but the local government's body limits for the time the shipment of trucks made it difficult.
He anticipates the increase in production costs, while the vendors seek to meet the demands, and less special promotions.
On Tuesday, the ALDI announced that since some stores could not make Wednesday special because they had released their supplies earlier.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an altarman from Queensland University of Technology, says that the shop fills supplies every night.
He stressed that toilet tissue was a hugely bulky material so that the amount of supplies were low and, if sold out, made a lot of empty space in the racks so that the quantity of goods became more expensive.
Coles and Woolworths feel [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if a product like toilet tissue and pens can be [bought] and there's a large amount, anxiety may be minimized, rising Russel Zimmerman through the ABC News Office.
The producer of the refill toilet tissue Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made tissue Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, which made Sorbent, stressed that they worked 24/7 to keep the supply, according to News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some property sellers offer a free toilet paper to the first auction bidder in Melbourne, when less auctions were held because the buyer took a break for long vacation weekends.
The Thursday NT News edition, a newspaper printed in Darwin, covers eight pages of a panel intended to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
The stores actually refused to apply the limits, according to ABC Australia's report on March 3rd, they said that they were not planning on applying the purchase limits.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also in high demand, including masks, treatment, dry foods, soap, and flour.
Also outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British Ocado supermarket was observed restricting the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs containing 12 scrolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) states COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak—disease caused by corronavirus SARS-CoV-2—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemi" refers only to how many diseases have spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to encourage the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemic trip.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates, and immobilizes its people as a response, it will be taught by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We were very good at the level of preaching and greed, both of which were a cause for concern.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center for Control and Disease Control, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, there is no virus of breathing that has ever been tracked from its onset to continued global circulation."
Gebreysus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic triggered by corronavirus."
He goes on, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status is following WHO's decision in January that declared this plague as a deterioration of the ill-being of the world's society.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "in other words, this plague will worsen."
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is a 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) that is continuing and is caused by akat 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The plague was identified in Wuhan, Turkey, in December 2019, was identified as a People's Health Disease that Frees the World on January 30, 2020, and is declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been healed.
The number of fatalities in the case is estimated at 4% in China, while the world is ranged from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing.
Complications may include acute breathing pneumonia and syndrome.
From the time of the appearance to the clock in general about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There's no known vaccine or specific anti-virus treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Preventive action recommended includes washing hands, closing mouths when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and independent isolation for those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by making travel, quarantine, nighttime, hazardous workplace control, and facility closure.
The pandemic has caused major global economic social unrest, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports, and the extent of the supply of items that are associated with panic - related purchases.
Schools and universities have been closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the population of students worldwide.
The misinformation about this virus has spread online and there are xenophobic incidents and discrimination against the Tunghoa people, people with offspring and appearances of East and Southeast Asia, and people coming from the area with a significant case of virus.
The reduction in travel and heavy industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions are decreasing.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the province of Hubei), reported a classer case of pneumonia with unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation carried out in early January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Grosir Sea Foods of Juanan and therefore the virus is expected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the plague is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered and associated virus with bat coronavirus, corronavirus scrambled, and SARS-CoV. The first person with a symptom was then known to fall ill on December 1, 2019, and the person does not have a clear connection to the next market classer mentioned below.
Among the early case classifications reported in December 2019, two-thirds of them were found to have a relationship with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, at 55 years of age from the province of Hubei, was probably the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case being reported to fall in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of Tibet had exceeded the number of new cases in the first time in Turkey.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
Until February 26, a relatively small number of cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds falling into 2.4% cases around the world.
Cases refer to the number of people who had been tested by COVID-19 and the results of their tests have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
Until March 23th, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in Turkey, until January 23, 86% of the COVID-19 infection was undetected, and that this undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was higher than the number reported.
The initial estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A research published by the United States Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases concludes that the number is likely 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers recovered.
For those who do not recover, time from the development of symptoms to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, some 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, until February 5, about 80% of deaths occur in elderly people over 60 years of age and 75% have a previous health disorder, which includes cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual fatalities of COVID-19 may be much higher, since official numbers may not indicate the deaths of untested people, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
The partial data from Italy found that the excess number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by factor 4-5 times.
A female talker for the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention admits, "We know [a number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual number," a statement strengthened by non-profit reports on the U.S. calculations that are too low. Too low a survey often appears in the pandemic, as in the 2009 H1N1 pig flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was on Wuh on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of the land of China occurred on February 1st in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14th.
By 28 February, outside the land of China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13th, over forty countries and territories have reported death on every continent, except Antarctica.
This number varies by region and by time, and is influenced by the amount of testing, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of death to case reflects the number of deaths among the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time range.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the death rate for the case overall is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) for April 10, 2020.
This number varies according to the region.
In China, the ratio of death to the case has decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Another assessment includes the number of case fatalities (CFRs), which reflect the percentage of those diagnosed with specific diseases, and the number of infections (IFRs), which reflect the percentage of those infected (diagnosis and undiagnosis) who die from certain diseases.
This statistic is timeless and follows a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for certain populations.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimated the number of fatalities infection for the entire pandemic between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate is carried out with the result of the first random testing for the COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical research that analyses the impact of the CFR assessment.
WHO asserts that this pandemic can be controlled.
The top and end of this plague is unclear and may be different depending on the location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University said, "Without control, the epidemic is usually contagious and then begins to drop when the disease runs out of the available amber.
However, it's almost impossible to make a projection that makes sense right now about when it happens."
The senior medical advisor to Tiongk Zhong Nanshan said that "this plague may end June" if the whole country can be immobilized to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine declared that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, possibly for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College research conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical restraint and other steps will be required "until the vaccine is available (probably 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's so easy to transmit, can disappear all of it" and this disease "maybe turned into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Replication viruses will depend on group immunity and mutation level.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be free of symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
An unusual condition includes fatigue, the production of the sputum of breathing (flegma), the loss of the ability to smell, to breathe, to the pain of the joints and muscles, to the throat, to the headache, to the headache, to the count, to the vomit, to the hemoptosis, to the diarrhea, to the serum.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention listed emergency symptoms including breathing difficulties, depressed chests or chest pain settling, sudden confusion, walking problems, and lip and face disturbances; medical attention is immediately advised if these symptoms appear. Further development may be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septics, septics, and death.
Some infected people may be asymtometic, which is without clinical symptoms, but with the results of tests confirming infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are close to those who are confirmed to be infected should be closely monitored and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa estimate asymtomatic ratios ranged from a few to 44%.
Incubation periods (when between infections and symptoms) usually range from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, uncertainty, the estimated number of COPID-19 patients who lost initial kissing 30%, then decreased to 15%.
Details of how the disease has spread are still reviewed.
The COVID-19 release is believed primarily to occur at close contact and through small droplet produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research found that uncovered coughs can cause droplets to 4 feet [4.5 m] (15 feet) up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that viruses may also be transmitted by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when speaking. Breath droplet can also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, although this virus is generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplet can fall into the mouth or nose of someone close to it or it may be in the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the lung (RJP) heart, can cause the breathing secret to turn into aerosol and then spread through the air.
Preaching can also happen when someone touches a contaminant surface, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through the liver, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government's vision of the possibility of fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.The most contagious virus in the first three days after the ravages of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and at the stage of further disease.
People perform positive tests up to three days before the clock, which indicates transmissions may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Only a few asymtomatic case reports are confirmed laboratoryly, but asymtomatic transmissions have been identified by some countries during contact search.
European Disease Control and Prevention Center (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person generally infects two to three others. This virus can survive on the surface for hours and days.
Specifically, it was found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylen) and 304-cart steel, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have touched the infected.
Koronavirus heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three patients with pneumonia associated with the classer case acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus features are associated with the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if it is hit by a household soap, which replaces the protective envelopes.
The virus is estimated to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that the genetic corronavirus is classified with the genus Beacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (b-seed line) together with two bat-derived gallus.
This virus has a 96% similarity in the entire genome level with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, researchers Tionghoa found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of a secondary genome between the corrugated virus and the human virus.
Until now, the entire genome's comparison has found the most 92% of the genetic similarity between corronavirus and corronavirus-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the ring is an intermediate saRS-CoV-2.
Virus infections can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is finally done through the reaction of the reverse transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) to infected secretes or through CT imaging.
A comparative study between PCR and CT in Wuhan showed that CT significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with the number of imaging features that overlap with pneumonia and other disease processes.
By March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a screening or first-line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has published some RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, first released on January 17.
Testing uses the reaction of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on a sample of breathing or blood.
The results are generally available within hours to several days.
Generally, these tests are performed on nasopharynx, but the throat vortex can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, no such serological tests were proved to be accurate enough to approve the use.
In the U.S., serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified labs.
The characteristics of the computed X-ray rendering and tomography (CT) feature in a symptomatic person include the background glass peripheral asymmetric opacity and no pleura efusi.
The Italian Radiological Society is building an international database for the findings of the capture on confirmed cases.
Since the patient has increased with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specifiity in identifying COVID-19.
A major research in Tiokok compares chest CT results with PCR and shows that although less specific for infections, more rapid and more sensitive imaging is recommended to be considered as a screening tool in the area of the epidemic.
Convolution neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the features of the imaging of the virus with X-rays and CT.
Strategy to prevent the spread of this disease includes keeping good personal hygiene comprehensively, washing hands, avoiding eye, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing tissue when coughing or sneezing and immediately throwing tissue into trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Steps are also recommended to prevent transmission. The governments in various regions have restricted or called to stop all non-essential journeys to and from affected countries and regions.
However, the virus has reached the scale of the spread of society in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread to society, and some members of society do not know where or how they are infected.
The use of the location data from the phone by the government for this purpose has triggered a matter of privacy, with the exit of the statement from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for this kind of surveillance limitation.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts have worked out a friendly privacy solution, such as using Bluetooth to record user distance to another phone.
Next, the user will receive a message if they're close to someone who's tested positive for COVID-19.Severe misunderstanding about how to prevent infection; for example, brushing the nose and chewing with non-effective custodial drugs.
There's not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing your hands is an incentive for you to avoid spreading disease.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands are dirty; before eating; and after filling up their noses, coughing, or sweating.
This is because, outside the human body, viruses were killed by household soap that damaged the protective layer.
In addition, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand-servicing with a low alcohol content of 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of lartans (in a minute disinfected ignited for a low-cart surface), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other streams, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glukonate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in the public facility, such as office or childcare, all areas such as office, bathroom, public area, electronic equipment together such as tablet, touch screen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machine used by the sufferer, it should be disinfected.
Health organization recommends that people close their mouths and noses with elbows crushed or using tissue when coughing or sneezing, and then immediately remove tissue.
Surgeons recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit volume and duration of the expiratory droplet spreads when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on time and way to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the use of masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces with insufficiently clean hands, which is a source of primary transmission."Masker also recommended to be used by people who care for others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of a healthy person's masks only if they are at high risk, such as the one who treats the patients of COVID-19, although WHO also admits that wearing a mask can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks to members of the public.
In the U.S., CDC recommends the use of non-medicine masks made of cloth. Thirk specifically recommends the use of medical masks once used to healthy society, especially when it is close to (1 meters (3 feet) or less) to others.
Hong Kong recommended the use of surgical masks when using public transportation or living in crowded areas.
Thai health officials encouraged people to make home masks and wash them every day.
The Czech and Slovak Republic forbids the public to go out without wearing masks or covering noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear a mask when they went to the public to protect themselves and others.
Austria's government forced everyone who entered the toaster to wear a mask of face.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear masks in public places.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since the mid-March, requires train passengers and city buses to wear face masks for April 1st.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time out of the house, and recommends the creation of artificial face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social limitation (also called physical restraint) is an infection control action intended to slow disease spread by minimizing contact between individuals.
Social limitation methods include quarantine; restriction of travel; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Social exclusion can be applied by living at home, limiting travel, avoiding communities, using out - of - contact greetings, and keeping the physical distance from others.
Today, many governments are either obliged or committed to social exclusion in areas affected by the plague.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government bodies and rapidly reduced health organization, starting from 250 people (if unknown as far as COVID-19 is concerned) became 50 people, and then 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany prohibited meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Age and people with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and disturbed immune systems that were at risk of serious illness and higher complications are advised to CDC as much as possible at home as possible in areas affected by the disease in society. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health services began to replace the use of "social borders" as "physical barriers", to clarify that its goal is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relations, either on a virtual basis or from a distance.
The use of the term "social borders" suggests that people must completely isolate themselves socially and do not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative means, and some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This recommendation includes the encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or virus symptoms.
Self-indulgence in the home recommended for people diagnosed with CVID-19 and suspected infected.
Many governments have decreed or recommended independent quarantines for all populations in the affected areas.
The strictest self-instruction of quarantine is issued for people of high risk groups.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to the country or region with the extensive COVID-19 spread are advised to do independent quarantine for 14 days since the last possible deployment.
The strategy in the control of the plague is support or suppression, and mitigation.
Reliance is done at the early stage of the plague and is intended to track and isolate infected people and take other steps to control infection and vaccinations that aim to stop spreading disease to the entire population.
When there is no longer any way to prevent disease, the next attempt turns to the mitigating stage: these steps are taken to slow down the preaching process and reduce its impact on the health care system and society.
Combination of the buffer and mitigation actions can be done at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1.The amount of the management of infectious diseases is trying to bring down the top epidemic, known as the epidemic curve.
It lowers the risk of failure in health care and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to deal with the disease include individual preventive actions, such as hand-cleaning, wearing facial masks, and independent quarantine; steps at the level of the society intended for physical containment, such as closing schools and canceling mass meetings; public engagements to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and steps at the level of the environment, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries also apply various steps aimed at limiting the spread of viruses.
South Korea introduces local mass and quarantine, and warns about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who do independent quarantine and wear a huge fine for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of facial masks and punishes the farmers of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (drinking, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) has a major challenge.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce demand peaks to health care up to 2/3 and death to half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and a runaway health system.
Depression can be selected, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus remains in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is first reached), because otherwise, the transmission will slide back quickly when the suppression steps are delayed.
Long-term interventions to press the pandemic have a social and economic impact.
There's no specific anti-virus drugs approved for COVID-19, but the development efforts are being made, which includes an existing drug test.
Absorbing free flu drugs, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the level of decency, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and breathing support may be needed.
The use of steroids can make patient conditions worse.
Some of the previously approved substances for the treatment of other virus diseases are being studied to be used in treating COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and household responses" can reduce the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting health services for patients' needs COVID-19 is a fundamental step in responding to the epidemic.
ECDC and the European regional WHO office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to divert resources from various levels, including focussing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible to cancel elective procedures, separate and isolate positive patients COVID-19, and increase intensive care skills with personal training and increase fan and bed.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called the zero patient).
The first known new coronavirus case can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiokuk.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei rose gradually.
Most of these cases are related to the Huanan Sea Cooking Market, which also sells living animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Whah Center Hospital told their colleagues about "coronavirus looks like SARS."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenenliang, were warned by the police because of spreading false diseases, and the others, Ai Fen, were reproved by his superior for the warning he had issued.
The Whah City Health Commission then released an announcement to the public on December 31 and told WHO.
Sufficiently many unrecognized cases of pneumonia are reported to health authorities in Wuhan that then triggered investigations in early January. At the beginning of the outbreak, the number of cases increases twice every seven and a half days.
In the early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of the province of China, supported by migration during the New Year Imlek and because Wuhan was the transport center and transit point of the main railway.
On January 20, Turkey reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6,174 people have been reported on January 20, 2020.On March 26, the United States has surpassed the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. By April 9, 2020, over 1,61 million cases have been reported worldwide; over 97,000 people have died and over 364,000 were healed.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Because of a pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area limit free movement and establish border control.

On January 23rd, in response to the decision of the central government to implement the transport ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea said that although the step was "clearly not WHO recommendations," but it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to prevent the epidemic in the most concentrated place of the plague" and he called it "not before in the history of human health".On January 30th, after confirming the human transmission to people outside of Turkey and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared this epidemic as the World's Resolved Health Disorder (PHEIC), which is the sixth PHEIC since the first step was taken in the wake of the Chinese flu pandemic in 2009.
Director General WHO Tedros Adhanom says that PHEIC is said to be "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and medium-sized countries that do not have a poor health system.
Responding to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take steps that disrupt international travel and trade unnecessarily" and "WHO does not recommend the restriction of trade and movement."

A number of Triune provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were terminated in connection with the management of quarantine efforts in Central China, which was a sign of dissatisfaction with the political institutions’ response to the outbreak in the region.
Some commentators believe that this step is intended to protect the Secretary-General of Communist Party Tiokkok Xi Jinping from public anger related to a coronavirus plague.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, reject previous confessions of the first corrona virus in Wuhan, and support conspiracy theory about COVID-19 from the U.S. or Italy.
The U.S. government Donald Trump refers to the corronavirus as "Tiokkok virus" or "Wuhan virus" and says that "Tiokkok's closures give power to the virus that is now turning into a global pandemic." This word is finally criticized by a number of critics as racism and "relevating attention from the failure of its government in dealing with the coronal virus."
The Daily Beast gets a message from the U.S. government that outlines a communication strategy and clearly comes from the National Security Council, with a strategy quoted as "All about Tyogkok.
We were told to try and deliver this message in any way possible, including the press conference and play on television."Media such as Politics, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claimed that the attempt to send relief to the countries affected by the virus is part of the propaganda drive to influence the world.
Head of Foreign Policy European Union Josep Borrell warned that there was a "geo-political component, which included fighting to gain influence through the transfer of facts and 'politics of generosity'."
Borrell also said that, "Thirk aggressively pushes the message that, unlike the U.S., they are a responsible and reliable partner."
It also calls for the U.S. to withdraw the sanctions of Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, and it is reported to send aid to the last two countries.

Early in March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity between the European Union and Italy, which had an impact on coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, the great Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Tiokkok is a bilateral response.
Of course, it's not a sign of good European solidarity."
On March 22, after receiving a call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Russian soldiers to send military medical supplies, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cites an anonymous "high-level political source" that says that 80 percent of Russia's help "is useless or a little useful for Italy."
The source accused Russia of an attack on the "geopolitics and diplomatic" charm.
President Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di May ignored the media reports and expressed appreciation for them.
Russia also sent cargo ships with medical aid to the United States.
The speaker Kremlin Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering help to fellows in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that if the U.S. equipment and medical manufacturer gets the chance, they will also be able to respond if necessary."
NATO military training "Defender 2020" planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war training since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary General Kampanye Nuclear-Weapon supplies Kate Hudson criticizes the practice of defending 2020: "In the current public health crisis, this training not only endangers the lives of U.S. forces and many participating European countries, but also the people of the country where they operate."The Iranian government has been severely affected by this virus, with about two dozen members of parliament being infected with fifteen or more current politicians.
On March 14, 2020, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and said that his country was having difficulty fighting a plague for lack of access to the international market as a result of the US sanctions against Iran. This scourge has prompted the United States to adopt a general social policy in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher education levels for the health of the community.
The political analyst expected this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's opportunity to be re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea are worse off because of this pandemic.
South Korea criticizes "the ambiguous and passive Japanese quarantine" after Japan announces that everyone coming from South Korea will be placed in quarantine for two weeks at a government-appointed location.
At first, the view of South Korea was shared by President Moon Jae-in's response to this crisis.
Many Koreans sign a petition, or call upon Moon's impeachment, based on their claims about the government's fault in dealing with the plague, or commend its response.
Some commentators expressed concern that it would enable the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament chose to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree timelessly, to postpone parliament and public elections, and to punish those who are deemed to be spreading false information about viruses and crisis management by the government.
Coronavirus disease was considered in the case of lack of supply, which stems from an increase in the use of equipment globally to fight epidemics, panic buys, and disturbances in plant and logistics operations.
The United States Drug and Food Supervisor warns about the lack of drugs and medical equipment because of the increased demand for consumers and food disturbances.
Some areas have also been traded because of panic caused by the lack of trees, such as food, toilets, and water bottling, which trigger supply shortages.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about the delay in the delivery of electronics.
According to director general WHO Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self-protection tools is 100 times higher.
This request resulted in a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and triggering the postponement of medical supplies for four to six months.
This is also causing a lack of protection worldwide, and WHO warns that this will endanger the health force.
In Australia, a pandemic provided new opportunities for retail customers to sell Australia’s products in Tiogkok.
This activity results in a drop in milk formula in some supermarkets and is eventually banned by the Australian government.
The steps of China and Italy in combating the development and illegal trade of important products were successful so that the anticipated lack of accurate food will be avoided in Europe and North America.
North Italy, with its large agricultural productions, has not yet been reduced, but the price can increase according to industrial representation.
The empty food stores are only temporarily found, even in the city of Wuhan, as the government officials of Tiokk took off pig meat reserves to ensure the community's diet.
Similar incidents also exist in Italy, which obliges food producers to keep reserves for emergency situations like this.
The global economic decline has been felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was hit in the first two months of 2020 by the steps the government took to curb the spread of the virus, and the sale of anecdotal rituals of 20.5%.
Because the land of China is the center of economics and major manufacturing, the outbreak of the virus is considered to pose a major threat to global economic destabilization.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the market will remain in motion until there is a clearer picture of the potential for the end result.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could surpass SARS disease in 2002-04.
An estimate of scientists at Washington University in St. Louis reported that the plague has affected more than $300 billion in the world's supply chain, which can last up to two years.

On February 24, the global stock market fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside of the land of China.
On February 27th, due to increased concerns about a coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indexes, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded a sharp decline since 2008, with Dow falling 1,191 points, one biggest day drop since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
The three stock indexes close the week with a decrease of more than 10%.
On 28 February, the Scope Ratings GmbH ruled the Tiongk government credit rating, but maintained its negative Outlook.
Again anecdotals are due to the fear of coronaviruses, the biggest decline on March 16th.
A lot of people think economic recession might happen.
Econom Mohamed El-Erian commends the urgent steps of central bank and timely state.
The central bank reacts faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst sectors affected by travel restrictions, the closure of the public places, and government actions that limit travel around the world.
As a result, many airliners canceled the flight because of the slightest demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British Flybe regional airline collapsed.
As a result of the industry's travel routes are at an unprecedented level.
Some railway stations and railway ports have also been closed.
The epidemic is consistent with Chunyun, the main travel season that relates to New Year's Eve Imlek.
A number of events involving many people were canceled by the central government and the area, including the New Year Festivals, and the private company itself shut down shops and tourist sites, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's Anthems and tourist sites were closed to prevent mass meetings, including the illegal city of Beijing and traditional temple shows.
In 24 out of 31 provinces, the city of the Virgin Islands, and the region of Tiokok, authorities extended the New Year until 10 February and ordered most of the work places not to be reopened until that date.
These areas are 80% domestic GDP and 90% export.
Hong Kong increases disease removal to the highest level and announces emergency conditions, closes school until March, and cancels New Year's celebration. Ritual sectors are affected globally by reduced working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to European and Latin America's blacksmiths fell by 40%.
North American and Middle Easterners have decreased by 50–60%.
It also resulted in a 33-43% decline in pedestrian traffic to the shopping center in March compared to February.
The world's shopping center operators take additional steps, such as an increase in health care, the provision of the ultimate examination of buyers' temperature, and the cancellation of events, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the recession can cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million people compared to the situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, some 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the 300 million migrant workers in the province of Tibet were displaced from their homes or trapped in the province of Hubei. By March 2020, over 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, a kronavirus epidemic may cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%. The quarantine area in India has caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid by daily wages). Surveys from Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have lost some kind of work. Almost 900,000 workers have lost jobs in Spain since forty years of service in the mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers filed temporary unemployment payments and 1 million British workers filed universal credit schemes. Almost half a million companies in Germany submitted short-term work schemes with government subsidies for their employees, known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Worldwide, the industry of show arts and cultural heritage is deeply affected by the pandemic, which affects the operation of organizations and individuals, both employed and self-employed.
The organization of art and culture sectors strives to uphold their high mission (often funded by the public) to give cultural heritage access to society, to maintain the safety of employees and society, and to support artists if possible.
By March 2020, around the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, shows, and other cultural institutions were closed timelessly, with exhibitions, shows, shows, and performances canceled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are forced to provide alternative services through digital platforms. As a result of this new and rapidly developed disease, it is the cancellation of religious services, large sports, and other social events, such as music and concert festivals, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry has also been disrupted, announcing that the celebration of the Holy Week in Rome, which falls in the last week of Christian repentance, has been canceled.
Many churches encourage Christian seniors to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some provide church services through radio, direct broadcasts, or television, while others offer a drive-in or rise up.
With the closure of the church and chapel by the Roman Catholic Diocese and the Holy Peter Square of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled the service and restricted public meetings at the church, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurduras.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced Friday's dismissal in the area of the plague and the places of worship, while Saudi Arabia forbids its entry into its territory and its inhabitants to the sacred places of Makkah and Medina.
Since World War II, the pandemic has caused most significant disruption to the world sports calendar.
Most major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the League of UEFA Champions 2019-2020, the First League 2019-2020, UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-2020, and the NHL 2019-2020.
This earthquake messed up the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that it would be "scheduled until after 2020, but not more than summer 2021." Around the world, casinos and other games are closed and live poker tournament broadcasts are delayed or canceled.
This caused many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites reported a significant new increase in registration. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with music groups delaying or canceling the concert tour.
Many large theaters like Broadway also delay all shows.
Artists explore various ways to continue to produce and share works through the Internet as an alternative for direct traditional performances, such as live live online concerts or make web-based "festival" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their works.
Many use the Internet with a kronavirus to spread online with many people who turn to humor and distracters in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 plague, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against the Tunghoa and East Asia, as well as against people from affected areas in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Fear, suspicion, and hostility are widespread in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
The report of February (when the majority of cases are still limited in Taiwan) records the feelings of racism revealed in various groups around the world that the Tunghoa people deserve to receive the virus or receive what they claim as a final reward.
Some countries in Africa have also experienced an increase in anti-Tiokkok sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on account of their region.
There's already support for the Tunghoa people, both online and offline, and for the people in the areas affected by the virus.
Suspecting outbreaks to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe who had serious COVID-19 outbreaks, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. People in the countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially sign petitions to ban the Tionghoa from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan became a Twitter train.
The Tionghoa and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in racist and assault harassment.
The U.S. President Donald Trump is criticized for calling coronavirus "Virus Tiokkok", a term that critics consider to be racist and anti-Tiokkok.
The taste protesters in Ukraine attacked buses that brought Ukrainians and aliens evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from East India, bordered by Tyokkok, and learning in large Indian cities are reported to have been subjected to harassment related to a coronavirus plague.
The President of the Bharatiya Janata Party State Unit in Western Begalea Dilip Ghosh states that Tiokkok has destroyed nature and "that's why God takes vengeance on them."
That statement was then threatened by the Tiokkok consulate in Kolkata, calling it "misleaded." In Tiokkok, xenophobia and racism against non-Tioghoa people are reported to be widespread, with strangers described as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "extended".
Many of the newspapers who use pay talks have deleted it for some or all of their corronaviruses.
Many scientific publishers have made it possible for the scientific community to have an open access to the epidemic.

Laboratory testing for a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes a method that detects the presence of the virus and detects the antibodies produced as a response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the sample is confirmed with the RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
These tests are specific and designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus only.
This test is used to confirm a new infection or is still active.
Antibodies (serology) detection can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibodies tests show the number of people who have been infected, including those with symptoms too light to report or without symptoms.
The mortality levels of an accurate disease and the level of immunity in the population can be determined by this test.
Because of the limited testing, by March 2020, no country had any background data on the prevalence of viruses in its population.
Until March 23th, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests that countries have done.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of case fatalities reported, which is likely to be too high in some countries.
Using the reaction of a real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on a sample of breathing obtained by various methods, including nasofaring orputum sample.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed on throat valves can only be relied on in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus could disappear in the throat as long as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
As an alternative, for those who are infected tested on the second week, sample material can be taken from the deep-breathing channel by using the isap or the materials that can be extracted by sputum.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the reaction of the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (RRT-PCR) and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
English Raya also developed testing on January 23, 2020.South Korea company Kogenebiotech developed SARS-CoV-2 CRP (PowerCheck Coronavirus) diagnostic tools on January 28, 2020.
This device is looking for an "E" gene that has all beta coronavirus, and a specific RdRp gene for SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Turkish National Medical Product Administration for SARS-CoV-2 responsibilities based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel Real-Time Koronavirus New 2019 (2019-nCoV) to a community health laboratory via International Reagent Resource.
One out of three genetic tests on the old version tests yielded uncertain results due to reactive errors, and the number of tests at CDC in Atlanta limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components considered to be unreliable until February 28, 2020, and after that the state lab and local laboratories are allowed to perform tests.
This test was approved by the United States Drug and Food Supervisor based on the Authorization of Emergency Use.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of a national RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made nationally available COVID-19 testing on March 9, 2020.
No amount limit is announced; collection and processing of the specimens must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the tests were registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reported developing tests to detect COVID-19 infections. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a 3,5-hour test with high volume so that a machine could perform approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of emergency (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing in the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorisation to the Holic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the US from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved testing using isothermal nucleat acid amplification technology that is not PCR.
Because there is no need for a series of temperature replacement cycles, this method can yield positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipate to increase production by up to 50,000 trials per day. Tests that use monochlonal antibodies that specifically bind the new nucleopapsid protein (N protein) corronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hopefully can yield results within 15 to 20 minutes as rapid influenza tests.
A review of a library published in March 2020 concluded that "photothoracs have small diagnostic values at the beginning, as the CT [computed tomography] may have existed before the clock."
Special features on CT include bilateral ground-glass opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and posterior distribution.
Subpleura dominasis, crazy Paving, and consolidation are formed as a result of disease development.
In Wuhan, a study that compares PCR with CT at the current point of the pandemic shows that CT significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many pneumonia and other disease processes overlap.
By March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a first-line diagnostic test in the COVID-19 diagnostics."On March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals from about 7 days after symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance. Checks can be done at the central laboratory (CLT) or by point-of-care (PoCT) testing.
The automatic system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this check, but the availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, a blood specimen is generally used by the periphery, although a series of specimens can be used to follow immune response.
For PoCT, it is generally used one specimen of the peripheral blood that was obtained through a skin prick.
Unlike the PCR method, the extraction step was not required prior to the examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 institutions that provided agency notification as needed and therefore could now distribute their anti-bodies tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test approved by the FDA based on the authorisation of emergency use. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European approval for their IgG and IgA antibodies testing tools for viruses in the blood sample.
The test capacity up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR checks on RNA viruses.
Antibodi was usually detected 14 days after weaning infection. In early April, Raya found that none of the antibodies she bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has set up a scheme for the expected patient to stay at home, "the emergency department will provide a specimen tube to the patient," they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results a few moments later. The British NHS announces that NHS is planning a suspected case test scheme at home so that it will remove the risk of the patient driving others if they come to the hospital or have to disinfect ambulances if used. On an emergency test for the suspected COVID-19 case, a professional health force will take samples using appropriate precautions.
On March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Germans said that Germany had about 12,000 tests per day in road traffic and 10,700 tests had been done in the previous week.
Costs are borne by health insurance if tested by the doctor.
According to president Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19th, a state-of-the-art test was offered in a number of large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested until and including weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital develop and test methods to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only further testing if a joint sample was found positive. In Wuhan, a 2,000-square-meter emergency survey laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin language: . . . . . or "Api Mata" in Indonesian language) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which was able to process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction being monitored by BGI Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the modernization showed that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the cost related to quarantine management could double if this test capacity did not exist.
The Wuhan laboratory was soon followed by the Huo-Yan lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities all over China.
By March 4, 2020, its total daily capacity is 50,000 daily tests. The open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. This balanced design can be carried out in a small laboratory without needing robotic fluid control.
Until the month of March, lack of adequate reagents has been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers are attempting to explore sample testing protocols involving sample heating at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, the Arab Emirates is reported to do more coronavirus tests per population captain than any country, and are ready to increase the testing scale for most populations.
This is achieved through a combination of state-of-the-art testing and mass-supply laboratory purchase of the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on the laboratory of emergency detection "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, this lab is capable of tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of China.
Various testing recipes targeting various parts of the coronavirus genetic profiles were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German recipe for the production of testing devices sent to low-income countries without any resources to develop itself.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Center for Disease Control was not available until January 28, so that it slowed down the testing available in the United States. In the beginning of the outbreak, Tiokkok and the United States had problems with the inspections; these two countries and Australia could not provide sufficient testing tools to meet the demand and recommendations of health specialists.
On the other hand, experts say that extensive testing in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
Test capacity, mostly in private sector labs, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic. High requirements for testing due to widespread viral distribution cause hundreds of thousands of testing to wait for testing in the U.S. private laboratory, and the supply of usp and chemical devices to become critical.
By March 2020, Tiokkok reported the problem of accuracy on their test devices.
In the United States, a test tool developed by the CDC has "disaggregate"; the government then removes the obstacle of bureaucracy that prevents private testing. The Spanish buys tests by the company of Tiokkok Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but finds that the results are not accurate.
The company explained that failure to collect samples or to use tests properly might result in a failure.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would pull out the wrong-doing equipment and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the tests purchased by the Czech Republic from Tiokko gave the wrong-doing.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that this test device be thrown into the Danube River. Karaate of the Turkish Health Ministry said that the test apparatus that was bought in Turkey from Tjeongkok had "high levels of error" and they didn't "use it". British Raya bought 3.5 million tests from Tiokkok, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test device could not be used.
Testing, followed by quarantine of positive tested people and tracking of people with positive people SARS-CoV-2, yields positive results.
Researchers working in the city of Vò Italia, the first location of death due to COVID-19 in Italy, did two rounds of testing on the entire population of 3,400 people, about 10 days away.
About half of the positive tested people have no symptoms, and all cases found in quarantine.
With the limits of travel to this community, new infections are completely eliminated.
With aggressive contact tracking, bordering, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore develops much slower than other advanced countries, although without extreme limitation, such as the closing of restaurants and ritual companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore suggested that people stay at home on March 28, but the schools were reopened on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with violent contacts, restrictions on entry, testing, and quarantine, but with quarantine areas that are not too aggressive, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower case fatality, perhaps because these countries are more able to detect people who have a mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that have no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive samples COVID-19 and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the “positive test result” column was influenced by the country’s testing policy.
The country that only tests people in the hospital will have % higher positive results than the country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with the same factors.
Washing hands, which is also called hand-washing, is the act of cleaning hands of someone who intends to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" throughout the day prevents many diseases, e.g. diarrhea and cholera, transmitted through fecal-oral routes.
A person may also be infected with respiratory disease, such as influenza or fever, if they do not wash their hands before touching eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucosa membrane).
Five critical days of a very important day to wash your hands with soap are: before and after a great shower, after cleaning your child's butt or changing diapers, before feeding, before eating and before and after preparing food or cooking meat, fish, or raw garlic.
If water and soap do not exist, hands can be cleaned with ashes.
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning kids who just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving a medicine or medical treatment can prevent or reduce disease spread.
The main purpose of the medicine is to wash hands from pathogens (cacterics, viruses, or other organisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also important to the public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infection;
and reduce infant mortality at home.
Studies carried out in 2013 have shown that an increase in the practice of washing hands can increase slightly.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates due to respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action may reduce the mortality rate due to the disease to almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea to about one third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low - intake areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea can be associated with soap washing. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and infections of acute respiratory tract (ISPA), as a low-conscious behavior done at home, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the cause of the number one death of children; this disease causes the death of some 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using toilets can save more lives than vaccines or any medical action, and reducing death from diarrhea to nearly half and death from acute respiratory tract infection by four.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitary actions as part of the water, sanitation, and hygiene program (WASH).
Washing hands also protects themselves from impetigo that is transmitted through physical contact directly.
The minor side effect of washing hands is the frequent washing of hands that can cause skin damage as a result of skin thinning.
Studies carried out in Denmark in 2012 found that overwashing can cause the skin of the itch and the cystic, known as the extreme hand or dermatitis of the hand, especially among health workers.
Washing hands too often is seen as one of the obsessive-compulsive (OCD) disorders.
There are five critical moments all day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the spread of fecal-oral disease, namely: before and after using toilets, after cleaning the ass, before feeding, before feeding and before preparing food or cooking meat, fish, or raw butter.
Another important time to apply the technique of washing hands to prevent disease from spreading is before and after taking care of the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal shit or handling animals; and after touching the trash.
In many countries, the level washes hands with soap is still low.
A study on washing hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that average 38.7% of households practice hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest level of 97 percent; the United States is nearly in the middle of 77 percent; and China at the lowest level of 23 percent. Now there are some methods of changing behaviors to improve the adoption of behaviors washing hands with soap at a critical time. Washing group hands for students at a specified time is one of the choices in developing countries to habitually wash hands in child behavior.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Education Department in the Philippines is an example of appropriate action to support children’s health and education.
A twice a year worm supply, plus it washes hands every day with soap and brushes teeth every day with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
The program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Microorganism cleaning from the skin is reinforced by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soap and detergents is to reduce the barrier to seafaring and increase the traffic.
Water alone is a skin cleansing that is not efficient because of fat and protein, which is a component of organic dirt, is not easily intoxicated in water.
Nevertheless, fat cleaning and protein are helped by sufficient water flow.
Soft soap, because of its reusable properties, may contain bacteria obtained from the previous use.
A small number of studies that investigate the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap conclude that transfer cannot occur because of bacteria bordered by foam.
Even so, the CDC continues to state "the liquid soap that it takes out of the container without touching the hands it prefers."
The anti-burning soap greatly encourages a healthy society.
Until now, there has been no evidence that antiseptic or disinfection use recommended better for organisms that hold antibiotics in nature.
However, the anti-bacterial soap contains general anti-censor agents such as triklosan, which have a list of ancient, long - held organisms.
So, even though an antibiotic-resistant strain is not targeted by the anti-bacterial soap, this soap may not be as effective as it is.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protection substances, advanced formulations may contain acid (ascetic acid, ascorbate acid, ascorbate acid) as an agent of the pH, benzoate as an active antimicrobial acid, and further skin conditioners (alternative language, vitamins, mentols, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon's Health Faculty shows that soap is as common as effective with the consumer anti-bacterial soap that contains triclades in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from hand.
The warm water that is comfortable to wash your hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm water is more effective than cold water is in removing natural oil that holds up dirt and bacteria.
However, back in the belief of many, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand-servicing or antiseptics are non-water-based sanitation agents.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the hand-cleaning agents of non-water-based alcoholics (also referred to as alcoholics, antiseptics, or hand-servicing) began to be known.
Most of these cleaning agents are based on alcohol or ethanol isopropyl, which is formalized together with agents such as Carbomer (acrylate acid polymer) becoming gels or with wets such as glycerin becomes liquid or foam to make it easy to use and to reduce the dry effect of alcohol.
Increased hydrogen peroxide energy increases further antimicrobial activity. Hand-held care contains at least 60-95% alcohol is efficient germ killers.
Alcohol treatment is sometimes used to kill bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), and mushrooms.
Alcoholic treatment containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log 3.5 decrease, similar to 35 decibel reduction) bacteria in hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5) bacteria in hand 1 minute after use. Manual treatment most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Hand-servicing alcohol-based hands almost entirely is not effective for norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause for gastroenteritis is contagious. Antiseptics or alcoholics in sufficient quantities should be used to immerse or cover two hands completely.
The front and back of two hands and on the back and end of all fingers rubbed about 30 seconds to liquid, foam, or dry gel.
The tip of the finger should also be washed well by rubbing it in two palms. The U.S. Center of Control and Prevention suggests washing hands instead of hand-washing, especially when the hands are dirty.
Improving the use of servants because of the ease of use and the rapid activity of murder against microorganisms; however, the agency of care should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing, except soap and water not available.
The use of alcohol-based hand-servicing can often cause dry skin, unless the emolien and/or skin-removals are added to the formula.
Drying effects from alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emolytes to formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol - based hand antimicrobial treatment causes irritation and skin dryness far lower than soap and antimicrobial detergents.
Dermatitis allergic contact, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive in the use of alcohol is rare.
The lower decrease causes dermatitis of contact that interferes with the pull of this product is compared to the washing of hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents do not wash their hands from organic substances, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, the cleaning of the hands is not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still in the hands.
The honesty of the freehand alcohol is highly dependent on the materials and formulations, and according to history, this product has a significant effect on working worse than alcohol and alcoholics.
Recently, a formulation using benzalkonium chloride has proven to have a continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, not like alcohol, which is proven to be less after repeated use, perhaps due to progressive side effects.
Many people in the lower - income community are unable to afford soap and use ashes or soil in exchange for it.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ashes may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, gray is also a disinfection agent because, if contact with water, ashes will form alkaline channels.
WHO recommends ash and sand as alternative soap when soap is not available.
Technique washes hands properly based on recommendation U.S. Disease Control Centers to prevent disease transmission include the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold water flowing.
The water is recommended because the lingering baccomm may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems unaffected.
Wipe your hands with a lot of soap, including your back, on your fingernails, and under your fingernails.
Soap raises germs from skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more accurately when using soap than when using water only.
Gosh for at least 20 seconds.
Crushing the damage, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubs longer to remove more gums.
The scale is accurately below the water flowing.
Bracketing in the baskom can cause the contaminants to return.
Drain with dry lips or let dry in the air.
Wet hands and wetness are easier to recontaminate.
The artificial nails and the disemboweled nails can keep microorganisms.
Mortgage lotion is often recommended to keep hands dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of infection spread.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to make it easier to wash hands when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, flowing water from the syringe or bottle that hangs and is holed and/or using ashes, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as school or rural areas in developing countries), there is a water solution, such as "tippy-tap", and other low-cost options.
Tippy orange is a simple technology that uses a water bottle that hangs with ropes, tucles that are operated by feet to pour a little water into the hands, and a little soap.
Effective handshake is an important part of the process of hand-cleaning, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hand-cleaning in the public toilet.
More and more research shows that paper lap is much cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by Westminster University, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper lap industry, to compare the level of paper lap cleanliness, warm air dryer, and more moderate jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% in the finger books and 254% in the palms.
Thrilled by jet air dryers led to an increase in the total number of average bacteria 42% in the finger books and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with paper, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in the books and 77% in the palms of the hands.The scientists also do tests to determine the potential of cross contamination in other toilet users and the toilet environment due to each type of method of drying.
jet air dryers, which consumes the air from the unit at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), are capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and units and potentially infecting other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters.
The use of warm air dryers spread the microorganism up to 0,25 meters from the dryer.
Paper paper does not show significant micro-organism distribution. In 2005, in a study by TÜV Product und Umwelt, various methods of handing were evaluated.
After the removal, the following number of bacteria is observed:
There are many hand dryers, and the hand dryers have been compared to the dryers by using paper laptops.
Washing hands with hand tools is alternative for traveling when there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand-servicing should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical washing was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital.
There is an electronic device that provides feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection was reduced by the use of the device.
Medical washing is done for at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gel to excite and rub each part.
Hands have to be rubbed by each other's fingers.
If there's dirt under the nails, it can be used to remove it.
Since the germs can survive in the water in the hand, the hand needs to be carefully trimmed and dried with clean lips.
After drying, paper is used to shut down the water tap (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids hand recontamination from the surface.
The goal of washing hands in health care is to remove pathogen micro-organisms ("skums") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of washing hands still at levels that can’t be accepted in most medical settings, with a large number of physicians and nurses continually forgot to wash hands before touching patients so that they transmitted microorganisms.
One study shows that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can lower the rate of infection of the blood flow linked to the catheter to 66 percent.
The WHO concept of hygiene can also be seen on its website for public comment.
A relevant survey by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of compliance with rules is required.
The World Health Organization has five times to wash its hands:
after being exposed to blood/water
Before an aseptic task, and
After the patient's treatment, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (the "medicine" or "antimicrobial" soap) was used to kill the handwashing material.
The kill function may be desired before the surgery or in a situation when an organism that holds antibiotics is very common. To 'clean' hands prior to the surgery, it is necessary to turn off and turn off without touching, chlorohexidine or iodium washing, sterile lap to dry hands after washing, and sterile brush to rub and other sterile tools to cleanse under the nail.
All jewelry has to be released.
This procedure requires washing hands and arms down to elbows, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not required.
When harvesting, water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
After they have finished washing their hands, their hands are rinsed with a sterile cloth and a scalpel.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands or use hand care before and after treating the sick.
For the control of staphyloccus infection in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands comes from the first 20% washing, and that the additional benefit obtained is very little when the frequency of hand-cleaning is increased above 35%.
Washing with soap usually causes more than three times the spread of infection to food than the washing of anti-bacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handshrinkers to reduce influenza A H1N1 virus and difficult Clostridium spores from hand. Intervention to improve the hygiene of the hands in health care can involve education for staff about hand-washing, increased availability of alcohol-based handshrinkers, and written and lip review to staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in various health care settings.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand washing facilities in the homes of residents, schools, and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing washer near private toilets or public toilets is rare, although options are available to make a cheaply washed area.
In any case, a low level of washing can also result from a habit that has been planted and not from lack of soap or water.
The desire and encouragement to wash hands with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and bring about changes in the behavior of the long - term population.
In order to walk effectively, surveillance and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that effective community-based approach to increasing the washout in LMIC, while a social marketing campaign was not effective. One example of school-based washing was UNICEF's "Third Star Approach" which motivated the school to take simple and cheap steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other requirements of cleanliness.
When the minimum standards are achieved, the school can move from one star to the last three stars.
Building a washroom can be part of a washing campaign designed to reduce the disease and death of a child.
The Day of Washing the World's Hand is another example of an increased awareness campaign that seeks to achieve the goal of changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 crown virus pandemic, UNICEF encourages the use of hand-washing emoji.
Some studies investigate the cost-effectiveness of washing hands worldwide in developed countries in connection with the avoidance of disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the missing year size of illness.
One survey showed that encouraging soap-washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
It was important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as a mother who had just given birth or an injured soldier in a hospital, first known in the mid-19th century by two hand-sanitary drivers: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "modern care workers" in England.
At that time, many still believed that infection was caused by the foul smell called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, a plague transmitted through food and infections related to health care made the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases more active stimulates hand hygiene as an important way to prevent infection spread.
Pig flu epidemics in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raise awareness in many countries would be of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from the infectious disease.
For example, the posters "the washing of the right hands" were hung next to the sinks washing of hands in the public toilets and in the bathroom of the office and airport in Germany.
The expression "washing hands from" means expressing a person's reluctance to take responsibility for something or engage in something.
The statement comes from the Bible chapter in Matthew’s book when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to make Jesus Christ, but it has been a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare’s work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands continuously to cleanse the imaginary stains; acts that indicated her guilt for the crime she did and had induced her husband to do so.
It has also been known that after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate the equipment to wash their hands.
Moreover, a person who is allowed to wash his hands after such meditation has a smaller degree of poverty involved in "cleaning" compensation, such as volunteering.
Religion ordered the washing of hands for the purpose of cleanness and symbolism. The washing of symbolic hands, which used water but without soap to wash hands, is the ritual portion washing hands in many religions, including Bahá'í'í trust, Hindu, lay down and neutralized Judaism in Jews, Lavabo in Christians, and Wudhu in Islam. The religion also ordered the washing of hands for cleanliness, especially after certain action.
Hindu religion, Jews, and Islam must wash their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindu religion, Buddha, Sikh, Jews, and Islam required washing their hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazardous control for COVID-19
Hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of safety and occupational health methodologies for the control of hazards for the prevention of 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Precise risk control at the workplace depends on the location and the job, based on the risk assessment of exposure, the level of disease in the community, and the risk of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, work at low risk has minimal contact with the public and other work partners; for this work, it is encouraged to prevent basic infections, which include washing hands, pushing workers to stay at home if ill, breathing ethics, and doing cleaning and disinfection of the work environment routinely.
Jobs at risk include jobs that require close contact or often with people who are not known or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected by the spread of ongoing society or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with public communities such as at school, the working environment with high population densities, and high volume ritual settings.
Hazard control of this group, in addition to the basic infection prevention steps, includes ventilation using high efficiency airflows, sine protectors, and providing self-protection tools when confronted with COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers the health and morgue that is exposed to people who are known or expected to suffer from high exposure to COVID-19, which increases the risk of high exposure if workers do aerosol production procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, people who are known or expected to suffer from COVID-19.
Controls appropriate for this worker include technical control, such as negative pressure ventilation room, and self-protection equipment that is appropriate for the job.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to take care of others, or fear of exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in the type of goods requested and in the way of obtaining these items (such as shopping outside busy hours, by delivery, or heights).
Eventually, shipments of items from the highly affected geographical area COVID-19 can be disrupted. The anti-psychiatry and plan to remove infection disease can be used to guide protective action.
The plans consider the risks associated with various workplaces and tasks, including the sources of postings, the risk posed by household and society, and the risk factors of each worker, such as age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also outlined what control is needed to overcome the risk and emergency issues that could arise as a result of the plague.
The psychology and the plan for the removal of contagious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The objective of the outbreak is to reduce transmission between staff, protect people at higher risk for poor health complications, maintain business operations, and minimize the adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The level of disease in the community where business is affected is affecting the action taken.
Hazard control hierarchy is a work environment that is widely used in safety and occupational health to block the threat control based on its effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and the last protective device.
Technical control includes the isolation of employees from work-related hazards without relying on the behavior of workers and can be the most costly solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in employment policies or procedures that need to be performed by the worker or the worker.
Self-protection (APD) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent part of the delivery.
All types of ODA should be selected on the basis of danger to workers, properly set up as (e.g., respiratory), consistently and correctly worn, checked, treated, and replaced on a time basis, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Health and Safety Administration, low - cost jobs have minimal contact with the public and other employees.
Steps to prevent basic infections that are recommended for all workplaces, including proper washing of hands, prompt workers to stay at home if ill, breathing ethics include covering of coughs and sinees, providing network and garbage vessels, preparing work from a distance or shift of work at a time of arrival/daily departure, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and doing cleaning and disinfecting the work environment routinely.
Rapid identification and isolation of potential individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using the treatment of fever or other symptoms, and so that the policy of sick leave is flexible so that employees can stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees learn about this policy.
According to OSHA, jobs at risk include jobs that require close contact or often within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are unknown or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of traffic in the community around the business location, or because someone has recently made an international journey to the location with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
This group includes workers who have contact with public communities such as at school, the environment of work with the population of high population, and the setting of high volume structure. The technical skills for this group and high-risk groups include installing high risk groups of high risk groups of the air filters of high efficiency, increasing ventilation levels, increasing physical restraint levels such as plastic physical barriers like constant constant constant constant constant guard, and installing a drive-through window or a structure for the customer service service. The administrative management for this group and high risk groups include encouraging the sick workers to stay at home, increasing ventilation levels, increasing physical restraint levels such as physical restraints such as physical restraints like plastics, making rotational rotational shifts on time arrival/go home, making a regular travel-coming/go home or setting a non-essentially critical travel to a location of the COVID19-19-19-19-19-19-s chapter change change room, typical variety of beauty skills and skills skills used in the service of the workers, the job management of the job management of the trade show show show show show show show show show show  service, how how he used, how he used, how he used, how he used, how he used, how he used his manner and how how he used his manner manner and how he used, how he used used used, how he used, how he used, how he used his skills and how how he used his skills and how how how how he used, how how how he used, how how he used, how he used, how how how how how how how how how he used, how how how how how how he used, how he used, how he used, how he used, how he used, how he used, how how how he used, how how how how he used, how he used, how he used, how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how he used, how he used, how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how he used, how how how how how how how how he used, how he used, how used, how how how used, how how how how how used, how how how how how he used, how he used, how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how and how how how how how how how how how and how and how and how how and how how how how how how how, how, how, how, how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how, how how how how how how, how, how and how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how and how and how and how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how, how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how, how, how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how, how, how, how, how and how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how and how how how how how how how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how
Workers in these risk groups rarely need a respirator.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers includes separating the sick from others by 6 feet, showing one of the cabins to take care of the sick, and offering a mask for the sick or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
You cabins should wear a medical gloves when you take care of the sick passenger or touch the body fluid or the potentially contaminated surface and may be another protective device if the sick passenger has fever, coughing, or breathing difficulties.
The handkerchiefs and other items should be disposed of in a life-threatening bag, and the contaminant surface should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.
Ideally, further medical action is done in the cabins of people isolated. Apart from public preaching, for schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short term closures to clean or disinfect if infected people have ever been in the school building.
If there is a migration in society at a minimum level up to now, a social reduction strategy can be applied, which includes: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, sound-coupling classes, or eating in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between table, arrival time and a flat return, limiting non-essential visitors, and using a separate health location for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high spread in the local community, in addition to a social reduction strategy, an extension of the school closure can be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, the risk of direct health risks is considered low by the CDC.
The law enforcement officer must contact the confirmed or expected COVID-19 recommended to follow the same guidance as the emergency medical technician, including the use of appropriate self-protection tools.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect the belts and pre-use equipment by using a home cleaning spray or lap and follow standard operation procedures to control and dispose of old ODAs and to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers certain body and body power to be at high risk or very high.
High-risk work includes health care, support, labs, and medical transport forces that are exposed to known or suspected CVID-19 patients.
This job becomes a very high risk if workers do aerosol production procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, known patients or suspected COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronkoscopes, some procedures and dental checks, or invasive specimen removals.
The work of the morgue at risk of high exposure includes workers involved in preparing the bodies of known or suspected COVID-19 cases at death; this work becomes very high risk if the workers perform an autopsy. Additional technical control for this group of risks includes isolation rooms for known or suspected patients of COVID-19, including when the aerosol procedures are performed.
Ventilation special negative pressure may be appropriate in some health care arrangements and mortgage rooms.
Specimen must be dealt with with with a Level of Biological Safety precaution 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come into a different waiting room be separated according to whether they are expected to be the COVID-19 case. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends a respirator for those who work within 6 feet of known or suspected patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and a person who performs aerosol-producing procedure.
In the United States, N95 approved NIOSH or better NIOSH face capacitors should be used in the context of written and comprehensive breathing protection programs that include compliance tests, training, and medical examinations.
Another type of respirator can provide greater protection and increase the comfort of the workers. WHO does not recommend a cover-up of the entire garment or because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluid.
WHO only recommended surgical masks to screen officer at the entrance point.
For a person who takes breathing spices, treats, or transports patients COVID-19 without aerosol procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, cloaks, and gloves.
If the aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by the N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Considering that the APD supply is not sufficient throughout the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for ODA through long-distance medical services, physical shielding such as the window of the blind eye, with only the person involved in the immediate treatment can enter the room containing the COVID-19 patients, use only the required ODA for specific tasks, continue to use the same respirator without releasing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnostics, monitoring and ordinating the chain of ODA supply, and does not encourage the use of masks for people without symptoms.

SUBJEK BARIS: [Cavid-19] Lighting the burden and preparing the future
TANGAL/WEEN PACKAGE: 14 March 2020, 00:34 UTC
LIST: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in an amazing situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes it clear the global human attachment and responsibility that we have to each other.
We've never had the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on empathy, cooperation, and global community building, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we have witnessed among all our fellow workers by e-mails, calls, and talks are an extraordinary validation of extraordinary people, which we are fortunate enough to work with.
I am grateful and proud to call you a fellow worker.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how much it means to the present world to access Wikipedia and how this is a powerful symbol of this vital resource to remain available to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, either you make sure this site keeps running, helps pay our partners, or helps keep our community safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially at this time.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to maintain the survival of the organization during this time.
We really want to eliminate the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce your schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is approximately 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notification is made.
We don't set a day off, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission requires you.
But the world cannot be predicted at the moment, and whether you need to care for the loved ones, spend on the needs of the tree, or go to the doctor, your well - being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your working time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have been necessary, but we're saying it.
Sick leave or PTO is not required, just tell your manager and help your team review the calendar and schedule to make sure the main work areas can be resolved.
(If you are diagnosed positively with COVID-19, please tell Bryan in the T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and make sure your situation gets proper attention from management).
Companions whose wages are based on hours will be paid full.
We've said it, and said it again, to respect our commitment to our contractors' partners and clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours.
It's included if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of stressing the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like these.
Once again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's a few jobs to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, and the Dana Collection team, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all the departments to evaluate the current purpose and divert our focus to support the essentials of our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus on the most essential project.
Slowing down the moment will be nothing for the future.
We're not planning on "working late after hours" after this pandemic passes.
You wouldn't be expected to work late to meet unrealistic deadlines right now.
We realize that the situation has changed and will try to set a new time line and target if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adjust to the new reality and the day - to - day work schedule, we decided to adjust the time frame for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Yearbook.
We mean to propose an extension of a 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgeting so that employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and care for loved ones while adapting their needs or wanting to work less on the schedule for a few weeks to come.
The length of this time line greatly reduces the workload and the pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We'll make our proposal to the council next week and update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, setup, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our partners based on SF might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, because we were very worried, we hired anti-virus cleaners to disinfect all surface at San Francisco’s office.
They use hospital-based antivirus to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
The building has applied its own safety control protocol by using products that support its supplier’s safety.
We're happy that the office will be ready to use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has distributed the COVID-19 protocol to us and all the staff members based on DC.
As of last week, our D.C. office has moved to a long, long, long-distance service with a guide that was shared with San Francisco.
As some of our fellow students based in NYC, we are also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work long distances for the first time.
Our long-working partner realizes that it may require adjustment and they want to give you advice:
The longest meeting time is one or two hours.
If the longer session is required, consider how to divide it into a few days.
Briefly define the meeting, on the agenda, and send out previous publications.
Make video as default, with Google Docs and Zoom tools to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Point the leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and record the list of speakers, and someone to help make a record (or make a collaborative record).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your health compensation to buy little food.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to a colleague about the work being shared
SDM Operations Team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support the increase of distributed work throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all the grant recipients of the community to cancel the public event that was funded by Wikimedia, like Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declared the pandemic ended.
We tell them that we understand our request for cancellation and other restraints can make them impossible to complete the approved interim activities and that no one will be given a pin because they have to delay or modify the target.
Next week we will continue with additional guidance on Wikimania and the regional community and other thematic conferences.
In general, feelings from all over the global community seem to be a source of sadness as a result of this disorder, but at the same time relief from clarity and the ability to focus on one’s own community, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT is trying to prepare a page at Meta-Wiki to provide community space to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Thursday coming, 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect.
We're in this situation together and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to obtain information from this email and all of the essential information related to COVID-19 at the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We also seek to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are now significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, the main course of work, or difficulties about the merits, or anything else that may require help, do not hesitate to inform and cooperate with the CRT.
We're here to help provide support and be a link as needed.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operation International SDM.
There is no such change to be seen as our work and our obligation.
On the other hand, this change is a recognition that, at this moment, our work and our obligations may need to be adapted the way we have never done before.
These changes are the steps that we believe are important in supporting each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need our movement, and give the world of service that they rely on.
The work we've planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support and create space for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months to come.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so you can work well when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other leadership team members (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzym angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has a opposite activity with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the number of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also functions as a dot entering into cells for some coronavirus.
ACE2 human versions are often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzymes are metaloenzymes containing seng located on the surface of endothel cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein has M2 domain peptidase terminal-N and domain transporter amino renal acid collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single type I membrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain found on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extrasex domain is separated from the domain transmegran by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the chained protein produced is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most of the organs: ACE2 is attached to the membrane of cells, especially type II alveolar lung cells, enteritis of small intestines, endotel arteries and veins, and muscle cells of arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The ACE2 main function is as an ACE controller.
ACE splits the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cut amino phenylalanine terminal carboxylic acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis became angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides include [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apple, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also arranges traffic membranes transporter amino neutral acid SLC6A19 and engages in Hartnup disease.
As a transmegran protein, ACE2 functions as a primary entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses, which includes HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (sars-coV virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, binding S1 protein on spikes or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 levels with ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface causes endostosis and virus translocation and enzymes into the endosomals located in the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires the primary protein S by a series of anang protease TMPRSS2, which is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesize that the decline of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continued ACE and ARB standard inhibitors.
A systematic and meta-analysis review, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors caused a decrease of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Further, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia on patients with higher risks for pneumonia, especially those with strokes and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with the reduction of mortality associated with pneumonia, although the results are less than the risk of overall pneumonia."
The ACE2 humans are recommendated (rhACE2) expected to be new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seems to increase the hemodynamics of the lung and oxygen saturation of the pig with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipoplysakarida.
Half-time rhACE2 on humans is about 10 hours with 30-minute workouts besides 24-hour (duration) effects.
Some findings show that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance against classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or in angiotensin II disease in increased blood circulation. Infus rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory syndrome treatment.
b' APPLICATION COVID-19 is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts to overcome the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying the "contak" that may have made contact with the infected.
Many applications were developed or proposed, which received official support from governments in some regions and jurisdictions.
Some frameworks for building a contact tracking application have been developed.
The problem of privacy is questioned, especially related to the system based on tracking the geographic location of the application user.
Alternatives that don't violate privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to another phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and iOS operating system.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has deployed applications that allow citizens to check if they have contact with the COVID-19 sufferer.
This application is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, it is used by an application called TraceTogether.
This application is developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be delivered to the government. Northern Macedonia launches "StopCorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track the pattern of people who are potentially infected and respond quickly to health care authorities.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and Health Ministry.
Until April 14, 2020, the application is still waiting for the Google Play Store and Apple App Store agreement.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application is in the advanced development stage and will be available for distribution within weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and France ("StopCoved").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore and BlueTrace protocols. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow; this application is designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security techniques at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur on the application-based system, which includes false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if the data taken is limited to a small portion of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of a misleading or dangerous coronavirus application, Apple sets limits on the kind of organization that can add related coronavirus applications to the App Store, which is restricted only to a "remist" organization or has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply a similar limitation.
Private supporters express their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure that is made to handle the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after a threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations make statements that limit such surveillance.
This organization states eight requirements on the government project:
surveillance must be "according to law, necessary, and proportional";
the range of surveillance and surveillance must have the sunset;
data use must be restricted for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance must avoid more discrimination and marginalization;
each data divider with third parties must be defined in the laws;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
participation means all of my "relevant interests" required, which includes community health experts and the marginalised group. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) German and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issue a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan means to deal with monitoring problems constantly by removing tracking mechanisms from the device operating system after it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based tracking, rather than applications, so they eliminate the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel a network - based survey was approved.
A network-based solution that has access to raw location data has the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with the central server need to access personal location data; a number of privacy-protected systems have been created and using the central server only for intercom (see below).
In South Korea, an application-free system is used for tracking contacts.
Instead of using special applications, the system gathers tracking information from various sources, includes cellular device tracking data and card transaction data, and merges this information to produce notification via text messages to people who are potentially infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes information the location available to the general public, which is permitted with broad changes in the privacy laws of information after it is removed by MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using both systems of privacy protection.
Until April 6, 2020, the details have not been released.
Contact tracking that protects privacy is a well-founded concept, with a large number of research literature starting at least in 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts worked out a friendly privacy solution, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user's proximity to another mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that includes a centralised and decentralised approach, and is not a single protocol. The centralized protocol includes a Decentralised Approach to Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), a Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called a Contact Event Number, CEN), a Protocol and a Private Sensitive Mechanism for Cellular Contact Tracking (PCT), and others.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, a platform to use a privacy-protection technique when collecting and using a background location or intersection data to track the COVID-19 distribution.
This was based on a study of the whiteboard "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar tool was the SafeTrace platform by the Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was also established at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive health locations and data with other users and officers without sacrificing the data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, Global NCT Coalysis was established by groups that had basically the same approach and were a much-expanding protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which was a key aspect of reaching wide-ranging acceptances.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government applications an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative for tracking contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on the combination of Low Energy Bluetooth technology and privacy cryptographies.
They also provided the specifications of the core technology used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to be launched in three stages:
launch of a tool to allow the government to create an official kronavirus tracking application that protects privacy
integration of this function directly to the iOS and Android Google and Apple plans to address data collection and monitoring problems continues to happen at first distributing the system through the updating of the operating system, and then deleting it in the same way after the threat passes.
b'Reposition of medicine (also called a new purpose, a new profile, or a new task in medicine or therapy) is the intended use of medicine for a new treatment purpose, namely for a different medical condition or disease with the initial purpose of drug development.
This path is a scientific research path that is currently being carried out to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
The other direction of research includes the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the convalesen plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several links.
Analysis of such linkage sites can be the basis for an effective antiviral drug development project against the COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphase.
Hussein A A, et al examined some of the candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed with the approved drugs and had the highest possible ability to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy in its clinical study to recommend in clinical study design.
Chlorokuin is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune disease.
On March 18, WHO announced that chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin were two of the four drugs to be tested as part of the Solidarity Clinic.
Governor New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin tests in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, FDA authorized the use of hydrochlorokuin sulphate and phosphate chlorokuin based on the U.S.
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trials and U.S. authorisations only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who have been treated by inept, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
CDC says that "use, dose, or duration of hydroxychlorokuin for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been set.
Doctors say they use that medicine when "there's no other choice".
A Turkish team of researchers in Istanbul is doing a small study on the use of chlorokin combined with eng, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
High school is being conducted at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and safety test and the accuracy of hydroxychlorokuin preventive use.
The Chinese clinical trial in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipyravir proved "effective clarity".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within four days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the cure.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipyravir and half received humifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Corps reminds the public that there is evidence to support the drug not too much and too soon.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for supplies and use military to send it to a university hospital, where it would be used to treat patients with CVID-19.

This medicine may not be safe if you are used by a pregnant mother or someone who is trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antivirus lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit is observed".
This medicine is designed to slow the replication of HIV by binding proteases.
A research team at the University of Colorado is attempting to modify the drugs to find a compound that will connect with the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in scientific society about the provision of resources to reposition drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO puts lopinavir/ritonavir into the international Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Then, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against some of the philosophers, pneumo-, paramigo-, and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with anti-virus treatment is resistance through mutations that can cause more severe diseases and transmissions.
Some early testing studies show that rendesivir may have a high genetic strain on resistance; there are ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials carried out by the University of Cleveland Hospital, one for people with illness and one for the sick.
There are three clinical trials being carried out for intravenous vitamin C for those who are treated with infa and severe COVID-19, namely two controlled plasebos (Tiokkok, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
New York State began testing for azitromysin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.

Researchers from Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently researching the role of collkisin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, given the name COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults at the age of 40 and older diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms so that it did not require infestation.
Women who are pregnant or nursing or do not use effective contraception methods do not meet the requirements.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low - molecular heparin has been widely used to treat patients so as to motivate the Italian Medicines Body to publish guidelines on their use.
A multi-centered study of 300 patients who studied the use of enoksaparin sodium at a prophylaxis and therapeutic dose announced in Italy on April 14th.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention is focused on giving a new treatment purpose to approved antivirus drugs and developed for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to Tiokkok's 7th edition
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to the Tiokkok's 7th edition
Some antibiotics identified potentially as a drug that can be given a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by Tiokkok.
In addition, the tests are also performed in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaksin COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed the clinical trial, there is much effort being made to develop the vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of this disease, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
Big epidemic spread throughout the world in 2020, which led to large investments and research to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop vaccines that might be able to resist SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that the point to be taken into account in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, distribution on a necessary scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI reported that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development during early 2020 to make an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Advanced main platform target for Phase I security study, includes:
nucleat acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (phase I control and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by ECPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active project (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 others are announced, but with little public information available (considered as being in planning or being planned).
Phase I-II tests performed early safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed at random, controlled placebo, and at some locations, determining the most accurate effective dose.
Phase III test usually involves more participants, including the control group, and tests vaccine effectiveness to prevent disease while monitoring side effects on optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in human assessment (also in research "praclinis").
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, Queensland University announced that they were investigating the potential of molecular capacitors that would genetically modify the virus protein to stimulate immune reactions.

On March 12, 2020, the Indian Health Ministry announced that they were working 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, the development of vaccines took at least one and a half years to two.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported developing particles similar to corronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with tests on humans planned in July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian reported that the U.S. President Donald Trump had offered "'a large amount of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with a German company, BioNTech, to develop a mRNA-based vaccine together.
Currently, mRNA-based vaccine candidates, BNT162, are in preclinical testing with clinical tests expected to start in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotec company Tax Biotech announced that they would receive the results of clinical testing in April 2020 and the vaccine candidates at the final stage could start testing in humans at fall.

Another ECI investment partner for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had initiated the six vaccine candidate test on animals.
Imperial College London researcher announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing RNA vaccines that could amplify themselves for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed in 14 days after receiving a sequence from the city.
By the end of March, the Canadian government announced a funding of C$275 million for 96 medical research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.

On April 2, 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University Medical School reported that PittCoVacc, Vaccinal candidate COVID-19, in rats; they stated that "the MNA that gave S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine produces a specific antigen response that can be started on rats two weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, Faculty of Pharmacy Waterloo University announced DNA-based vaccine candidate design as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteria, DNA is designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce particles similar to harmless viruses, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, governments, industries, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM's supercomputers, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologist effects, which are also called non-specific effects.
It means that these vaccines can benefit beyond the disease that prevents them.
Australia's top-notch tests are trying to complete 4,170 health officers.
There is a possibility that the vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess vaccine honesty using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-manufacturer primates, shows the need to take steps to achieve the level of biological safety 3 in dealing with life viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested on a non-human animal model.
By 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and health institutions around the world.
When MERS becomes dominant, the confirmed SARS research can be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatment against MERS-CoV infections.
By March 2020, there was one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed phase I clinical testing in humans, and three other vaccines in the process, which were all viruses vaccins, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVAC), and one MVA-Vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts contain conspiracy theories claiming the virus behind the COVID-19 has been known before and that the vaccine is available.
The patents quoted by various social media sites refer to patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronaviruses, such as corronavirus SARS.
b'Choronvirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by akat 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of a sense of smell, and stomach pain.
From the time of the appearance to the clock in general about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases resulted in mild symptoms, some developed into viral pneumonia and failed to perform a major organ.
By April 17, 2020, over 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, and this virus, especially, spreads interhumanism when it comes to close contact, often through sparks or small drops produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
Despite being produced while breathing, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface rather than contaminating to a distant distance.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is highly contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the next stage of the disease. Standard diagnostic method is with the reaction of the polymerase chain real-time transcription (rRT-PCR) on the nasofaring usop.
The use of masks is encouraged for people who are suspected of being infected with viruses and people who treat them.
Recommendations on the use of masks by different publics; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend the use, and others enforce the use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific anti-virus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
A person infected with viruses can have symptoms such as flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathlessness.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain, or assailation in the chest that continues, confusion, difficulty getting up, and face or lips; medical withdrawal is immediately recommended if these symptoms appear.
An upper respiratory disorder, such as sneezing, swallowing, or sore throat, may be found, but it rarely occurs.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in a wide range of percentages.
Some of the cases in the early Chinese language were with only a description of the chest and palpitation of the clinical pain.
In some people, disease can develop into pneumonia, failure to make drugs, and death.
It was called an incubation time.
Incubation times for COPID-19 usually are five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of the people who grow up will experience symptoms in 11.5 days of infection. Report shows that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of the transporter without symptoms of transmission is not fully known; however, early evidence indicates that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms unknown and are being investigated, with the Korean Center for Control and Disease Control (KCDC) reports that 20% of all cases are confirmed without symptoms during hospital treatment.
The Turkish National Health Commission began to report cases without any symptoms in the daily case on April 1st; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and mud water can carry a virus on a large scale.
Speaking out with more sparks or droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can cause droplets to reach a height of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not transmitted by air, the U.S. National Science Academy has shown that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air transporters placed in the hallways outside the room produce a positive sample for RNA viruses.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the lung (RJP) heart, can cause the breathing secret to turn into aerosol and then spread through the air.
While there is concern that the virus can spread through a phase, this risk is believed to be low.
European Disease Control and Prevention Center (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person generally infects two to three others.
Specifically, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard/carduine, up to three days on plastic (polypropyl) and copper-harden (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective when used properly; soap products break out the fat layer of the virus protectors, activate the virus, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Another stream, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glukonat (surgery disinfection), is less effective.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus load, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus load at the second-day test.
Koronavirus heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new heavy acute breathing syndrome, the first time isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the cluster of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus features on the corronavirus that is related to nature.
Outside of the human body, this virus was killed by household soap, which damaged its protective bubble.
The lung is the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesses anang cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzymes, the most prevalent in lung type II alveolar cells.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spice or capillary" to connect to ACE2 and enter an angel cell.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12% of the infected people who were treated poorly in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and more often in severe disease.
High levels of cardiovascular symptoms are due to systemic inflammation and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial injuries may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
High thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in patients of COVID-19 infection at ICU and may be associated with bad prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropics for the airway epithel cells that express ACE2, patients COVID-19 heavy have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, T-cells that secrete GM-CSF pathogens are proven to be interrelated with monosit recruits that secrete IL-6 inflammatory and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphostic infiltration was also reported on autopsy.
WHO has established some testing protocols for this disease.
Standard testing method is the reaction of the polymerase chain real-time transcription (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on the respiratory sample obtained by using the nasopharynx; however, the nasal orputum sample may also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but it takes two samples taken within two weeks so that the result has a small time value.
The Chinese scientist is able to isolate this coronavirus and regulate its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop an independent polymerase chain reaction test to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if someone has previously infected) are in development but not widely used.
The experience of Tyokko with that test showed only 60 to 70 percent of his accuracy.
The FDA in the United States agreed to the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of the month. The diagnosis required by the Zhongnan University Whah Hospital suggests a method of detecting infections based on clinical images and epidemiological risks.
Bilateral ground-glass opacity with periphery distribution, asymmetrics, and posterior much found at the beginning of infection.
Sub-pleural domination, cracy Paving (lobular septum matching with varied alveolar filling), and consolidation can appear as disease develops.
A little data is available on microscopic and pathophysiology studies COVID-19.
The main pathological finding on autopsy is:
Makroscopy: pluurisis, pericarditis, consolidation, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of disease virus pneumonia can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumosite hyperplasia, large-fat pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the establishment of giant cells with a lot of ingredients
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar output.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and heavy hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in the healing stage: high levels of alveolar rounds and interstitial fibrosis lungers
Blood: intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerethroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommending the use of the part in the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hygiene after coughing or sweating is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth cover in public, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. The strategy of social limitation is intended to reduce contact with people infected with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public.
Limitations also include keeping a distance of at least 5 feet [6 or 1.8 m] or more.
There is no known effective cure to prevent COVID-19. Because vaccines are not anticipated until the beginning of 2021, the main part in treating COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as the "curve ratio".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands are dirty, before eating, as well as after filling up their noses, coughing, or sweating.
Further CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand-servicing services that contain at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand-servicing is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not active substance for hand antiseptics".
Glyserol added as a wettan.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends people who suspect that they carry a virus to wear a simple face mask.
The oxygenation of the extracorporeum membrane (ECMO) has been used to deal with respiratory failure problems, but the benefit is still considered.
Self - hygiene and lifestyle as well as healthy eating patterns are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful for those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the TIOCC National Health Commission have issued recommendations for treating the patients of COVID-19 who are being treated in an unfavourable manner.
Intensive care professionals and medical specialists in the U.S. have developed recommendations for treatment from various institutions to be free of charge, i.e. IBMC.
Until April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical forces recommend parasetamol (astaminofen) more than ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautionary steps should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care arrangements when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For the health force that treats COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Cellar-Air Infection Isolation Room (IIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact prevention actions, and cellular prevention actions. CDC spells out guidelines for the use of self-protection devices (APDs) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: APD clothing, breathing or face masks, eye protectors, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (not face masks) are better.
N95 respirator is approved for industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used by the U.S.
N95 respirators are designed to protect from airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified use on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using a facial shield or, as the last attempt, a made-up mask.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until they need mechanical or alternative ventilation, but most of them are heavy.
Type of breathing support for people who have failed to breathe linked to COVID-19 is active being tested for people who are taking in, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal canal or bipositive air vent pressure.
It's not known if one of these two methods results in the same benefits for people who are critically ill.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique restricts the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal canals. The more severe case occurs in the elderly (those over 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years old).
Many advanced countries have no adequate hospital bed per captain, which restricts the capacity of the health system to handle the surge suddenly the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require innate rates.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the COVID-19 patients who were treated eventually entered the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurs on COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
A ventilator capable of doing pressure control mode and high PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury and ventilator-related pneumothoracs.
High PEEP may not be available on the old fan.
Research on the potential for treatment began in January 2020 and some anti-virus drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of a new drug may take up to 2021, some of the drugs being tested have been approved for another use or are in further testing.
Antivirus drugs can test people with severe diseases.
Volunteers who recommend WHO are also involved in tests of potential efficacy and safety of treatment.
Plasma convalesen has not yet been given the required clinical studies to prove its safety and effectiveness for this disease.
In February 2020, Tiokkok launched a mobile application to deal with the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This application can detect 'near contacles' using surveillance data so it can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, applications not only recommend independent quarantine, but also tell local health officers. Analyze data on phone data, facial recognition technology, tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people who interact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
By March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security services to track the phone records of suspected coronavirus patients.
That step was taken to treat quarantine and protect people who might be contacted by infected citizens.
Moreover, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared telephone data aggregates with the German federal government body Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of viruses.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian health commissioner Giulio Gallera, said he was told the mobile operator that "40% of citizens still move places".
The German government did the 48-hour hackathon weekend with over 42,000 people.
In addition, President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions to combat coronavirus spread.
People may experience stress as a result of quarantine, bordering travel, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection themselves.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Raising social isolation, loneliness, anxiety of health, stress, and economic downturn is a perfect storm that threatens mental health and the well-being of society."
This disease can be mildly or without symptoms, similar to another general’s respiratory disease, such as pile.
Small cases usually heal in two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may need to be three to six weeks in order to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for heavy COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still less. In some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs so that pneumonia can affect them.
In the worst affected person, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or failure of the mucus.
Complications related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood flow, and damage to the heart, kidney, and heart.
Blood clotting disorders, especially an increase in prothrombin time, are observed in 6% of patients undergoing infested COVID-19, while kidney function changes are seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with the COVID-19 picture show an increase in the heart enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between the clock and death is ten days, with five days spent in the course of the inept.
However, the patients who are transferred to the ICU have a median of seven days between the rate of inappa and death.
In a study that investigates early cases, the median time from initial symptoms to death is 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, men had a death rate of 2.8%, while women had a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological testing postmortem lung sample shows diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromydosis in both lungs.
The cytopathic changes of the virus were observed in pneumositis.
Image of the lung resembles acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Tiokkok National Health Commission, heart damage is observed, with an increase in troponin or heart rate.
According to the March data from the United States, 89% of people who are under treatment have poor conditions. The availability of medical and economic social resources in an area can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary because of the differences in the area, but also because of methodological difficulties.
Fewer calculations of minor cases can cause a death count to be too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases can mean the current mortality rate is too low.
Peroxoc has 1.4 times greater chances of severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decline in lung capacity in some who recovered from the disease, and lung screening showed organ damage.
It can also cause a flu-intensive disease after recovery.
Until March 2020, it is not known whether previous infections give effective and long-term immunity to those who recover from the disease.
Immunities viewed may be acquired, if you look at another coronavirus behavior, but have been reported to have recovered COVID-19 followed by a positive corronavirus test a few days later.
The case is believed to be a severe leftover infection, and not a re-infection.
This virus is supposed to be natural and from animals, through widespread infections.
As if not actually known, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by the transmission of humans to humans.
A study of 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, first published in January 2020 at The Lancet, revealed the earliest warning date was December 1, 2019.
The WHO's official publication reported the earliest warning symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and by time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established the ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for death from the SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed laboratory and U07.2 for death from COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without confirmation of laboratory for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death rate in cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death rate for the case is 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) by April 17, 2020.
The number varies according to the region. Other measurements include the number of fatalities (CFR), which reflect the percentage of people diagnosed with specific diseases, and the number of fatalities with infections (IFR), which reflect the percentage of people with infections (diagnosis and non-diagnosis) who die from certain diseases.
This statistic is timeless and follows a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people create antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people who have been infected.
In an outbreak epicenter in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 residents, 80 (1.7%) is already dead.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread through the carnival festival, which spread among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and probably not all of the COVID-19 deaths classified as the COVID-19 death.
Further, the German health system has not yet come under control.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) were affected by the death of COVID-19.
His pandemic and mortality levels are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies done in Tiokkok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with a different risk between new men and women does not appear at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The reasons for such differences are unknown, but genetic factors and behavior may be an excuse.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people are men and 72% are men who died because of COVID-19.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track the sex-related data for COVID-19 infection.
Research indicates that virus disease, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affects men and women differently.
The percentage of health workers with a higher gender, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
The WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is the abbreviation for crown, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first outbreak identified: 31 December 2019.
This name is chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., Tiokkok), species of animals, or a group of people, along with an international recommendation for an intended conception that prevents stigmatization. Virus that causes COVID-19 to be called a heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communication.
Both disease and the common virus are called coronavirus.
At the beginning of the disease in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease are referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and an akat 2019-nCov respiratory disease as a temporary name for viruses and diseases according to the 2015 guidelines that did not use the location name in the name of the disease and the virus.
Official name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of the limited capacity in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal valves and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital was in great need of ventilator valves, and a supplier could not give in the required timescale, a local company was re-
After the beginning of the COVID-19 plague, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and disinformation came about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and aspects of other diseases, which spread rapidly.
Humans seem to be able to spread viruses to some other animals.
Study failed to find evidence of replication of the virus on pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and the COVID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academics, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization used SOLIDARITY Trial to examine the effects of four antiviral compounds that were already with the most promising honesty.
Vaccines are not available yet, but various institutions are active in developing vaccine candidates.
A previous study of SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were both using the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First, researchers aim to make a full vaccine virus.
The use of the virus, either an inactive or dead virus, is intended to rapidly trigger the human body's immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, is designed to create vaccines that make immune sensitive to specific subunits in viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on S-spike protein that helps virus infect the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nuclear acid vaccine (DNA or RNA, a new technique for making vaccination).
An experimental vaccine designed with these strategies should be tested for safety and safety. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code that is copied from the virus that causes disease. The increase in the anti-antibodies has been recommended as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials ongoing in April 2020.
Seven tests try to evaluate the treatment that has been approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychlorokuin or chlorokuin.
The newly targeted antivirus drug formed most of the Chinese research, with nine Phase III tests on rendesivir in some countries with a high reporting rate at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidates and the COVID-19 drug is in place.Some antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which include remesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxychlorokuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir are combined with interferon beta.
By March 2020, there was temporary evidence for the honesty of redesivir.
Increased clinical attention is given to patients who have been treated with redesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being performed in the United States, China, and Italy. Chlorokuin, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in Tiokok in February 2020, with the initial results.
However, there is a call for an international review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorokuin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice the dose is very dangerous and can be deadly.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized emergency use for hydroxychlorokuin and chlorokuin on the policies of a doctor who treated the patients with the CVID-19.The 7th edition of Tiokkok also reported interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against the CVID-19.
The initial data showed that a high dose of ribavirin is required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksakinide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing SARS-CoV-2 detrusion in low concentration.The study shows that the initial premonition of a ton protein by a transmembran 2 protease (TMPRSS2) is very important for input of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chlorokuin and hydroxychlorokuin with or without azitromysin has great limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of cytokine storms can occur at COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychlorokuin may have an antisitokin nature. Tocilizumab has been put into the treatment procedure by the T.T. National Health Commission after a small investigation.
This drug is undergoing phase 2 tests at the national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with severe diseases.
Combined with a blood test of the serum to identify a cytokine storm, this drug is intended to fight a cytokine storm, which is supposed to be the cause of death on some affected people.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of cytokine rerefracter steroids induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there's no random and controlled evidence to show that tocilizumab is an abuse for CRS.
Transfer the refined and enhanced antibodies produced by the human system that has been cured from COVID-19 to those who need it is being tested as a non-vaccin passive immunization method.
This strategy is tested for SARS with inconclusive results.
Neutralization of the virus is a working mechanism that is expected for passive anti-bodies therapy to mediate defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cell cytotoxicity that depends on antibodies and/or phagositosis, may as well.
Another passive antibody therapy form, for example, using produced monochlonal antibodies, is in development.
Convalescent serum production, which is part of the fluid of cured patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be enhanced for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of closely associated syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Center Hospital, who later became infected and died because of COVID-19 after spreading awareness of the virus.
