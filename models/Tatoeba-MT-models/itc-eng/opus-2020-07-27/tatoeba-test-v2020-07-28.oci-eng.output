That blanket you're up to.
There are the deverse tones.
I sang it all the time.
The guy's got a face.
You can't agree with her percussion.
What did he say?
The water is life.
Tom is as big as his father.
That hostage needs to be painted.
Do you want to dance?
Turn your left hand.
That's my panties.
They're all in the yard?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, ship, ten.
The man who's talented.
Love your mother?
What did Bell make up?
Where did they go?
I'm gonna have a cup of coffee.
