Well - meaning counselors worry about ‘ looking like a fool ’
Some stewards suggest that they have their title changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Council).
The concerns are due to a plan to convert the Council’s vow to the Welsh council.
Counsel from all classes is concerned that this could make them ridiculed.
One worker member said that his band was concerned because “it rhymes with twip and Pwp. ”
For readers living outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means mad, and pwp means fece.
A member of the team called Paid Cymru said that the whole party was “unsatisfy ” and has provided other suggestions for the term.
A well - thought - out representative said that his group had “opened their minds ” about the name change, but he noted that the word MWP and Muppet was not very different.
In this context, it can be noted that the Welsh letter w is carried in a similar way to English.
The advice, now acting as a legal bill to bring up the noun changes, stated: “The final decision of all vows taken over the members of the Governing Body will, of course, be with the members of the Governing Body. ”
The Law on the Government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) gave the Welsh Council the power to change their name.
In June, the council published the findings of a public poll that showed great support for calling the council a success.
As for the title of stewards, WMP (Welh Parliament Members, Welsh congressmen) was chosen to be the most supportive of the public in polls.
According to news reports, counselors now offer other suggestions, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the chairman of the Council, Elin Jones, to provide a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The bill on reform will also include other changes in the way the advice works, including regulations regarding the disfellowshipping of stewards and the organization of the committee.
Counsellers will be able to pay their final title bill when discussions about the bill begin.
The Macedonians take votes in elections for name-changes in the country
The voters will vote on Sunday as to whether to turn the name of their country to “The Republic of Northern Macedonia. ”
This case was voted in an attempt to resolve decades of conflict with neighboring Greece, whose province has its name, Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their neighbors in the north equals a requirement in its territory and has repeatedly protested their applications for EU and Nato.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said that he will not view the election as valid.
However, officials of the voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become part of the EU and Nato.
St. Martin sounds church bells in Harlem
“ The older people I’ve talked to said that in the past a bar and church could be found on every street corner, ” said Mr. Adams.
“ Today neither can be found there. ”
He said it would be understandable for a stretch of weight to drop.
“ People have other ways of meeting ” today, he said.
“ Bears are no longer the center of the neighborhood where people meet regularly. ”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money lost from possessions will not last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later, they will be back to the beginning. ”
He added that the churches may be replaced with an apartment building filled with people who will not help save the stable cities of refuge around them.
“ The majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, ” he said, “and, as a result, will be able to keep these churches closed forever, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were inhabited by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the black - Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church a decade later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original white Methodist congregation moved away.
A local black - language congregation took over the building.
A congregation of Blacks took over St. Martin’s church under the guidance of Father John Howard Johnson, who took the initiative to cut traders on 125th Street, Harlem’s main store street, who longed to hire black workers or to give them promotions.
The building was seriously damaged in 1939 in a fire, but members of the congregation of Father Johnson planned to rebuild it and had them also build the class game.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson called the class game proudly “the bells of the poor people. ”
The expert who played the rock game in July described it as another name: “Education Fund ” and“ A Lastable Music System. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng, from University in Michigan, also noted that this was the first class game in the world as a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played on, but he moved to a bigger game in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin hadn't got anyone else in his place.
During the past few months, a number of architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders and others by the Episcopal.
The Council of Churches, who oversees the parish and is appointed by church leaders - wrote the Episcopal in July and expressed concern that the Episcopal “would seek to bring the expense to" church council, even though it had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the Bishop.
Some parish members complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the Episcopal.
A shark hurts a 13 - year - old boy who dived down a lobster in California
According to the government, a shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy and wounded him on Saturday when the boy was diving for a lobster hunt on the first day of his first day.
The attack was just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach Coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on a Saturday morning when he heard the boy shout for help, and then as well as a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he at first thought that it was only tension to have reached a lobster, but then “he realized that the boy cried,“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
All his collarbone was ripped up," said Hammel about what he saw when he reached the boy.
Hammel added: “I cried on everyone to get out of the water, ‘ There’s a shark in the water! ’
The boy was taken with helicopter to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously wounded.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is not known.
The head of the Coast Guard, Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type of sharks.
Giles added that the victim had been severely damaged by the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed the coasts from Ponto Beach coast at Casablide to Swami’s coast in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and safety.
Giles said over 135 different sharks were in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainbury's with a plan to crash in Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury’s plans are to compete with Boots, Superrug, and Debenham with cosmetics in a shopping mall, and with special assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter Britain's beauty market, worth 2.8 billion pounds, and grow up while sales on fashion and household products are getting smaller.
Pornography is part of a major market route to use shelf space that was once used by TV balls, microwaves, and household products.
Sainsbury's claims to double her beauty selection for up to 3,000 products, including trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees will also get extra space with marked areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The store is also going to reschedule the sales of its Boutique products so that the majority of the defenses are road-friendly, but younger consumers demand it more and more.
In addition, the perfume store Fragance Shop will test the warehouse in two Sainsbury's stores, the first one opened in Croydon in South London last week, and the next one will open up in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
The Internet trade and the increased tendency of consumers to buy a small amount of food daily in local stores mean that major markets have to work harder to get people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, manager of Sainsbury’s, said that the stores would be more and more like shopping stations as the trade chain tries to combat Aldi and Lidl’s low-food stores with more service and other products than food.
Sainsbury's has put Argos camp into hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat stores since the two chains were bought two years ago.
The first attempt of the store to revive its beauty and pharmaceutical departments was not successful.
Sainbury’s research was conducted with Boots around the year 2000, which ended because of differences in how to share incomes with drugs in the supermarkets.
The new policy follows that Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical products to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd medication store, over 125 million pounds ago.
According to the policy, Lloyd will have a role in these programmes by adding a great deal of luxury alarms, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, president of Sainsbury’s marketing, said: “We’ve completely changed our appearance on our cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
Also, we have invested in special training for staff who will be provided with advice.
Our toolware is designed to fill all needs, a pleasant environment and comfortable location make us an exciting beauty shop that transforms old business."
Peter Jones "Enraged" after Holly Willoughby cancels 11 million pounds of contract.
Peter Jones, the star from the Dragons Den episode, became “excited ” after TV broadcaster Holly Willoughby withdrew from 11 million pounds of contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home-and-a-party badge, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, a trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, 37 years old, hostes This Morning program, announced his decision at Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star from Dragons' Den, to the hurt of his forehead by canceling involvement in a popular lifestyle firm at the last minute to focus on new and lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “adversive ” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the world headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the popular TVwoman admitted that she did not have enough time for her home-and-consequential signal Truly because of the new treaties that are worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company has been compared to Goop, the trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was designed to double Willoughby’s property, whose estimated value is 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced at Instagram that she was going to pull herself out of Truly, Jones flew from Britain to stay in one of his many summer homes.
One authority reported: “Truly was the last person on Holly’s list of priorities.
This was to be her future project, which would make her income over the next two decades.
Her decision to quit took everyone completely off guard.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, but it was so short that the line would go into the market.
It's full of goods at Marlow's headquarters who's ready to go for sale."
Experts believe that the elimination of This Morning presents, which is among Britain’s most popular star, can cost the company millions of dollars because of heavy investments, from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and may result in further delays in selling the product line.
Or it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a three - year - old mother, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been a good friend of Jones and his wife, Barbara Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby formed Truly along with Capp in 2016, and Jones, aged 52, joined them as chairman of March.
They spend their summer vacations together, and Jones has 40 percent of their share in Baldwin’s company, which produces TV programs.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the trademark M3/4S and will replace Anti McPartlin as the factorator of the ITV components I'm a Celebrity.
A source of close Jones said last night: “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
Hard discussions “and then we fell in love ”
He boasted about the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for presidents, and for being so positive toward the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given so much to you?
Said Trump and imitated the voice of a reporter.
"I haven't given up anything."
He explained that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a large step toward nuclear launching North Korea.
However, there have been discussions about shutting down nuclear weapons.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the chief ambassador of North Korea, told international leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the north had not received “a proper answer ” from the United States at the first steps of North Korea toward nuclear launch.
Instead, he said that the United States continued to sustain business interests in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was more positive in his meeting speech.
“ We get along with North Korea pretty well, ” he said.
“ We were going to war in North Korea.
Millions of individuals would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have yielded positive results in rocket testing, release of hostages, and return to the earthly remnant of U.S. soldiers.
He also had an unusual approach to discuss his relationship with Kim.
“ It is so easy to behave like a president, but instead of trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there, Trump said and pointed to the population in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have caused great damage to an island, hundreds have perished.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, an international relief organization was told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s residents had to flee their homes, emergency conditions were not declared, which is the basis for the establishment of an international organization.
“ Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for help from an international organization, so this is difficult, ” said Miss Vimbung.
Although the organization Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pala, it is not yet certain when foreign relief workers can begin working in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the U.S. disaster organization, said that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Pala to see if an international organization should be allowed to help with the relief work.
Compared with the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the land is a sadly poorly prepared country to protect itself from natural forces.
Flood control has been built in Aceh, a rare sight on other coastlines.
It seems that the lack of tsunamis in Pala had further added to the loss of a person, even though a warning has been issued.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between the many islands in Indonesia can be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complicated.
A medical ship that has been docked at Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site of disaster.
President Joko Widoo made it his main campaign to repair the subjugated transportation of Indonesia and has deposited large sums of money in the roads and railways.
However, lack of funds has been planned for Mr. Joko's government, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to deal with persistent tension between the religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted more conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as the Christian gangs and Muslims fought in the streets with machetes, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.

He rolled the ball to the left, and then he tried to shoot to a point toward the distant pole.
The ball flew high over the target and toward its right corner.
Finally, the ball crossed Campa Arrizabath, which jumped up, and into the net.
“ I just wanted to try to get into this position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as long as possible, so I tried to make as much time as I could," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“ I saw Kante come and touch one time, and I didn’t think so much about it, I just took the shot."
Chelsea was over 1-0 at halftime after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
In the parish, General Chelsea gave the ball with a heel kick to Mateo Kovacic, and then he dived from the center to the Liverpool.
Kovacic gave the ball a quick walk between the center.

The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832 according to an early Sunday report by the U.S. disaster agency.
Sutopo Purw Nugroho, chairman of the Agency, said at a press conference that a large number of people had been buried when construction collapsed in the Friday earthquake and was 7.5 points on the Richter Scale. The tremor caused tsunamis that reached as high as 6 meters.

A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
In the afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.

The statue of the British Parliament of Cromwell is the latest monument accused of “resigning history ”
The statue’s ban would be poetic justice for the destruction of the raging Puritian escorters on so many cultural and religious jewels of England.
The Cromwell Company, however, said that Mr. Crick's proposal was “poor ” and“ an attempt to rewrite history. ”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate of having a statue removed, the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace was inevitable.
The spirit of the English Civil War against cultural symbols was neither a command nor an act of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
The impressive statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft, is evidence of the prevalence of the 19th century and is part of the history of a man that many believe is still worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is counted by many, perhaps rather late in the 19th century than today, has been the guardian of the council against external pressure, in his case of the monarchy.
Whether this description is entirely correct is still a historical issue.
However, the conflict that existed in the mid - 17th century may have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well - known individual representing one side of their conflict.
It is worth saluting, and remembering his doings as the defender of the kingdom."
Pig attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him
Pig attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in southwestern China, according to local news.
The man named only with his last name “Yuan ” was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered with blood near a dozen at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to reports from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in pigs on May 30, 2005, Xining, Qinghai, China.
He had traveled with his uncle from the neighboring region of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, the uncle found him dead and saw that a door into the nearby pigsty lay open.
He said that inside the chair there had been big hogs with bloody mouths.
A trial confirmed that 250 kg of male pigs killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My uncle's feet were bloody and wounded," said the uncle, whose last name was "Wu," to Guyang Evening News News News.
A video from a security camera showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up, so there was no attack on anyone else while police collected evidence at the scene.
According to the news, Yuan's family and its owners are in the market for compensation before his death.
Although rare, pigs have been reported to attack people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a wife and her husband at their home in Massachusetts and seriously hurt the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig trapped a Welsh farmer with a tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another man from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but that blood taste can trigger aggression in them.
“ They're just playing.
They'd love to snap and be curious they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to show them some respect," he said.
The remnant of the hurricane Rose carry a great harvest across the southwestern United States
As foretold, the strength of the hurricane Rose fades as it passes over cool seas on the north coast of Mexico.
On the other hand, Rosa will carry a large harvest that could cause flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa became a hurricane in Group 1, with a wind strength up to 136 km per hour, at 5 o’clock in the morning to eastern times on Sunday, and he was located more than 600 miles [600 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is estimated that Rosa will head north on Sunday.
At the same time, in the formation of the Pacific Ocean, it will head east towards the west coast of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm of rainfall in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical rock will be mixed with the approaching troughs, forming a vast, broad - range crop over the southwestern part of the next few days.
Localised doses of 2.5 to 10 cm may lead to sudden floods, soil movement, and possible landslides in the desert.
A massive tropical debris will produce up to 5 to 10 cm of rainfall in an hour in some places, especially in the southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that up to 5 to 10 cm of rainfall in some parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona states.
There is a potential for flash floods with rapidly changing circumstances because of the widespread exposure of tropical rains.
People are strongly advised not to walk into the wilderness when there is a threat to tropical rains.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into smoldering rivers, and thunders can lead to storms and storms.
The nearby layer will carry local spills in certain areas at the coastline of Southern California.
There is a possibility of over 1 cm out of rain, which could result in a slight movement on soil and a mountain on the road.
This is the first rainy rainy season to produce the area.
Several scattered tropical rainfalls will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rainfall spreads over larger areas late Monday and Tuesday.
A great rainfall will cover four states on Tuesday, and it will last Wednesday.
In October, as the Arctic is cooling, the tropical belt continues to warm, and the temperature changes are expected throughout the United States.
At times, this can result in extreme temperature swings over short distances.
A very good example of heat change could be seen in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
There's almost 7 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer shelters will try to build up and disperse again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to receive a warm start in October with temperatures around 25 degrees or more from the south plains to the northeast.
A fever could reach 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C.] in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long - term forecast suggests that there is a high probability of a high average temperature for the East of the United States during the first part of the October month.
Over 20 million people were watching at Brett Kavanagh's hearings.
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony made by Brett Kavanagh, the Supreme Court, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Bresey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct that was due to have occurred in the 1980 ’ s.
At the same time, the Polish pattum continued, and TV stations interrupted a regular program to publish the latest news on Friday: Senator Jeff Flake, from Arizona, suggested a bill that the FBI be able to examine the charges for one week.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was convinced that Kavanagh had fondled her drunk and tried to undress her in a school party.
Kavanaugh, in a emotional sense, testified that he was convinced that this had not happened.
Likely, more people were watching the trial than the 20,4 million Nielsen told us about Friday.
The company measured the average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other TV channels that showed the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also in Nielsen, it is usually difficult to measure people’s ratings in office.
To put this in context, this audience is similar to the size of a football game or the Oscar Prize Festival.
According to Nielsen, most people watched the hearings that took all day at Fox News Channel or 5,69 million, and the demonstrations of that channel have loyally supported the nomination of Kavanaugh.
ABC was in second place with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest continued.
Flake was the center of the ball game on Friday.
After the office of this member of the Republican Party issued an announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh in favor of the cameramen CNN and CBS, when Protestants shouted at him on Friday morning, he tried to go into an elevator to get a meeting with the Justice Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while he was being rained down on the air at CNN.
One woman said: “I stand right here in front of you."
“ Do you think he's telling the truth to the people of the land? ”
People said to him: “You have authority, while so many women stand without authority. ”
Flake told his office that he had issued a statement, and before the elevator door was closed, he said that he would express himself more in the hearing of the committee.
The Kapal and TV stations all had a live feed later when the Justice Committee decided whether to submit the nomination of Kavanaugh to the Senate election.
Flake said he'd only do it if the FBI examined the charges against the committee next week, but the minority of Democrats has encouraged that.
Flake became convinced in part by conversation with his friend Chris Coons, senator of Democrats.
Flake decided after a conversation with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
Flake's vote was crucial because it was clear that Republicans did not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has issued permission for the FBI investigation of the Kavanagh charges.
May, Britain’s prime minister, accuses critics of being “in politics ” for Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May, critics of her plan to walk out of the European Union to “be politically ” about Britain’s future and undermine its interests.
Theresa May, Britain’s prime minister, attends the Birmingham Conference, Britain, on September 29, 2018.

Wayde Sims Shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the death of LSU player
Police have arrested one suspected suspect because of Wayde Sims' death in a lethal shooting, and he was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Roge Police Department.
Authorities published a video of the struggle between Sims and Simpson and said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found their glasses at the scene and said they found a gene from Simpson on them, according to the WAFB, a sister friend of CBS.
Police say Simpson confessed at the hearing that Wayde shot him and killed him.
According to his lawyer, there was a guarantee of $350,000.
The Department of Justice of East Baton Roge County issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is gunshot in the head and down to the neck.
The authorities wanted to thank the U.S. Special Police Department in Louisiana, the police criminal lab, the South University Police and the citizens in the area for the assistance of the investigation that led to the arrest.
The director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked law enforcement officers for “his zeal and his search for righteousness. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two - foot - high front grew up in Baton Roge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and took 2.6 outputs per game during the last season.
Will Wade, the basketball coach of LSU, said Friday morning that the team was "hard hit" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
“ It’s something you worry about all the time, ” said Wade.
A Volcane spouts ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after their activity increased in the crater, with 183 cases reporting emissions of gas and ashes over a 24-hour period.
The center was watching trinkets and shakes from the volcano.
Social photos showed a thin layer of ashes on automobile windows in Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geological physicsists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 miles [ 72 km] southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 at Richter in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as the “Don Goyo, ” has been active since 1994.
Police fighting the Catalan apartheidist right before the anniversary of independence votes
Six were arrested at Barcelona on Saturday after independent Protestants accepted the riot police, and thousands shared in protests on grounds of the first birthday of the controversial election in Katalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked segregators stoned rioters with eggs and threw powder paint that would form dark dust clouds on the streets, usually filled with tourists.
Wars also broke out later that day, and police used clubs to control seizures.
Disagreementers cried out: “We do not forget and do not forgive ” for several hours while opposers cried out:“ People live Spain for a long time.
According to local media, 14 had to be treated for minor injuries.
There is still great tension in the independent area one year after the U.S. vote of October 1 was banned by the authorities in Madrid, but it was hailed by the Catalan separationist.
The majority of voters chose independence but were poor because most of those opposed to separation ignored the election.
According to the Catholic authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop the campaigns around the area, which resulted in conflict.
A group of independent people had spent the night on Friday to prevent protests in support of the police.
The protest march took place, but it was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electrician, participated in protests with his wife and said that he was no longer hoping that the Cataloni would gain independence.
“ Last year, we experienced some of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy in being able to choose but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having won the necessary but few victorys in regional elections last December, the independent parties of Kathalia have found it difficult to maintain a damp for a year, since many of their most prominent leaders are either in exile or in prison waiting after trial because of their role in organizing the vote and the Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who took the protests to support the police on his phone, said that politicians in both states had encouraged the conflict.
“ The tension keeps growing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catholic leaders who have been imprisoned and waited for trial from late last year, announced that he would volunteer for the European Parliament next year.
“ My offer in the European election is the best way to condemn the funerals in the democratic values and oppression that we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.

Mean scores in the 1-0 victory of Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Mega won Livingston's victory
Livingston’s team, who came from the lower division, caught the surprise of Rangers, and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the difference, and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not yet won a field in the top leagues this season and plays against Hearts, which are eight points ahead, next Sunday.
Before that game, Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the League with six victories, and Major Holt has not yet had to experience loss since he replaced Kenny Miller for the past month.
Livingston Loses Opportunity Against Necessary Visits
Holt's team should have been over a long time before it cut the goal, but their directness caused a big problem for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but he hesitated in his attempt to score, and then Alan Litagow made a pass after pushing through the defense to receive a balding signal from Graig Halkett across the finish line.
The guests made Rangers play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause trouble in the right places.
And that is how the goal was scored.
Rangers got extra kicks and Livingston worked to create a market opportunity.
At that point, Rangers had ruled the ball, but the defense of the locals was implacable, and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper, did not have to put forth much effort.
So it continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend himself from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor, the ranger of the Rangers, and the Litagow fired from the point of leaving Livingston.
The questions remained in poor Livingston's balance, but were kicked away, and two demands for the penalty--after Halket's defense against lipman Glenn Middleton, and one after hand--was dismissed.
Livingston’s "Beautiful" analysis
Alasdair Lamont, reporter of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Nice performance and finals for Livingston.
For a normal man, they were doing a wonderful job and continued to exceed all expectations.
Their style of acting and teamwork has hardly changed from their return to the highest division, but Holt deserves to be commended for having been polished together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, captain, was a tremendously good man and led a full-scale defense while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worall on his toes the whole time.
Rangers, on the other hand, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard, they played far below expectations.
They went badly to the end of their parishes and only once managed to open the fields of the local people, so this should be a zombie for Rangers now serving in the middle of a department.
Erdogan is receiving a foreign welcome at Cologne
On Saturday ( September 29), the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which has the purpose of improving the relationship between the two Nato nations.
There have been disagreements between them on issues such as human rights, media freedoms, and the introduction of Turkey into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Kölnar to open a new huge mosk.
The city is the home of most Turkish people outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the muse, but a number of supporters were in their vicinity to see their President.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdar - also spoke up, condemning both Erdogan’s course and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The two Protestant groups reflect the controversialness of this visitor, who is hailed as a hero of some Turks in Germany and hated as dictators of others.

And in October last year, riot police were called at the place to cope with a serious crisis of peace, where employees with poolballs were attacked.
The hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, with rapid floods (stranges could benefit)
It is uncommon for tropical rains to cross Arizona, but this is likely to occur early next week when the remains of the hurricane storm Rose cross the southwest, at risk of flash floods.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings about flash floods by Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rosa will cross Phoenix on Tuesday and be late on Monday with her final watch.
The Phoenix Meteorological Weather Service stated that “ten hurricanes have been able to maintain their strength to be classified as tropical storms or decommissioned for less than 200 miles [320 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border."
Last forecasts from the nation’s hurricane center predict a return of 5 to 10 cm, with occasional rainfall up to 15 cm in Mogolon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely that rainfall will be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas in the southwestern region, including the central part of the Mountains and the Great Mountains (The Great Basin), with a potential for occasional rainfall up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of flash floods, the rainfall from Rosu could be a blessing, for there are great droughts in the area.
Although a flood can cause great damage, some of this rainfall will have a positive effect, where drought is now in the southwestern part.
According to the U.S. Burg control, at least over 40 percent of Arizona is drying, which is the second largest category," according to the news of the rain.com.
First, hurricane Rusa will land on Baja California skagans, Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a peak wind intensity of 136 miles per hour and is approximately 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and traveling north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
As the storm passes over the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean, its power is getting smaller.
Thus, it is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday or Monday evening.
There is a potential source of substantial rainfall in some areas of Mexico, with a significant risk of floods.
“ Excerpts are being made up of 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of getting up to 25 cm of rain.com.
In turn, Rosa will head north over Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the border of Arizona early on Tuesday morning as a tropical center, and it will continue through Arizona and arrive at the southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“ The greatest danger expected from Rose or her remains is a very high rise in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and southwestern United States desert region, ” said the U.S. hurricane centre.
It is expected that this rainfall will cause life - threatening flash floods and movement on soil in the deserts, and we will crawl into a mountain country.
The attack at Midsmer Norton: Four arrests due to attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20 - year - old man have been arrested for attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teen playback was found wounded at the Excelsior Terrace region in the Midsmer Norton, about 04 p.m., at the British local hour on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be “stable. ”
One 17 - year - old boy, two 18 years old, and one 20 - year - old, was arrested at the Radstock area at night, according to a police officer from Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked witnesses who might have phone recordings of what happened to themselves.
Trump says that Kavanagh “was allowed to experience the evil and anger ” of the Democrat Party.
“ A law to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the ruthless and shameful tactics of the Democrat Party, ” said Trump at a meeting with supporters in Wheed, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanagh “was allowed to experience the evil and wrath ” of the Democrat class throughout his nomination process.
Kavanagh witnessed before the council on Thursday, when he severely accused Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed to the Committee on His Conspiracy.
The president said on Saturday that “Americans had seen genius and character and courage ” Kavanaugh the other day.
“ Convenience on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most brilliant lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an elegant CV as a public employee," he said to a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of the involvement of Republican supporters in the mid- season election.
“ One of the most important elections in our lives is five weeks.
I don't volunteer, but I really do," he said.
“ That’s why I go around the world to fight for great candidates. ”

The first key vote on the floor of the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh should be made no later than Friday, according to the assistant of the Republicans in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds died after an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and likely the number of deaths will rise
At least 384 were killed, and many were washed away as huge waves scurried on the shores, when a great earthquake and tsunami rode over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday.
On Friday, hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in Pala, where as many as six feet [6 m] of water were lit on the beach at sunset, washed out many people and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami developed after an earthquake of 7.5 points on Richter.
“ When the tsunami was formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t flee immediately, so they died, ” said Sutopo Purw Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia’s disaster agency, at a brief meeting in Jakarta.
“ The wave didn’t come alone, it pulled cars, logs, houses, all over the country, ” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open ocean at a speed of 800 miles [800 km] before shaking on the beach.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Pala.
Air photos published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and stores, cords, and broken bridges and moss surrounded by water.
Aftershocks, the coastal city continued to ride on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes was observed in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia’s formation of food and technology stated that the energy released in the big quake on Friday would have been about 200 times higher than that of the atom bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geographic location at the end of a long and narrow flea might have increased the size of the tsunami, said the Agency.
Nugroho said that the damage was “severe ” and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had collapsed.
The body of several victims was found trapped under debris from broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and property damage could be greater along the coastline 300 miles north of Palu, in a region called Dongglala, near the earthquake’s recordings.
Nugroho said that communication is totally down, and no information comes from Dongga.
“ Over 300,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross in a declaration, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the territory.
“ It’s already a tragedy, but it could be much worse, ” said the Red Cross.
The Agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had caught Pala, even though government officials said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published on social media, you could hear from an upper - floor building to warn the people on the street below that a tsunami was approaching.
Just minutes later, the tsunami strikes on the beach, carrying off buildings and automobiles.
Reuters could not confirm the video yet.
The earthquake and the tsunami produced a lack of electricity that hindered communication with Palau and made it difficult for the authorities to organize relief work.
The military has begun sending airplanes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, according to local authorities, but people who have been helped from the area still need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has only been reassigned and will be shut down in October.
President Joko Wido is planning to visit a refugee center in Pala on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800 depending on the tsunami in Indonesia.
Things are really bad.
World Vision staff from Dongla has reached safely to the city of Pala, where it takes refuge in the tent cities that were set up in the park outside their offices.
“ People said they saw many houses destroyed, ” he said.
Things are really bad.
Relief groups have started a difficult relief program, but some have complained that foreign relief workers with great expertise were prevented from traveling to Palau.
According to the Indonesian Regulation, foreign funding, supply and personnel can only begin to arrive if the crash area is declared to be a disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“ It’s still a local area of accidents, ” said Aliia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open for foreign assistance, but no statement has yet been made."
When the second night fell upon Pala after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and their families who are still missing held in the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that shed hope on the drenched headlines of natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday a relief worker saved a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian glider, had been a coach for the past month of Indonesia’s two gliders missed.
Others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Mandayi.
“ As a man with long experience in hovering, I have my own emotional burden to bear, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that an hour after reporting within the hover group because Roa Roa Roa the hotel had crashed, he would have sent a message from WatsApp desperately to the contestants who stayed in Pala and participated in the shore festival.
However, his message showed only a gray signal, instead of a blue one.
“ I think that means that the message was not received, ” he said.
Thieves steal $2,750 at their refill of Newport Bank on the Leve
Friday morning, thieves robbed 26,750 from Brink, a Newport Banker who was filling on the Newport on the Leve, according to a Newport News Report.
The driver of the car had been emptying ATMs in the amusement area and was about to add more money to it, told Detective Dennis McCarthy in the announcement.
As he was doing his job, another man “jumped behind the workman ” and stole a bag of money designed for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects flee from the scene, according to the announcement, but the police did not reveal how many were involved.
Anyone who might have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapker Knye West is going to change his name -- into Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The creature who was formerly known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time, using the name as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change will happen to his participation in the Saturday Night Live show where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces American Grandi on the show, but she dropped out of it for “tongue reasons, ” said the producer of the show.
West has previously said that this name has religious meaning for him, but it is also short for his present name.
“ I believe that “ye ” (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means“ you, ” West earlier in the year when he discussed the name of his record with the radio editor Big Boy.
“ So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It left Kanye, which means the one, and then it goes to just Ye--to be just a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many celebrities who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred to be called Love and Brothers Love.
JAY-Z, former colleague of West, has also written his name with and without dash and suction.
The President of Mexico promises not to use the army against citizens
Andre Manuel Lopez Obbrador, elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against citizens, now the country will soon recall the 50th birthday of bloody revenge against students.
Saturday, on the Tlatelolco square, Lopez Obrador promised: “Never use the army to oppress the Mexicans. ”
Soldiers launched a peaceful protest march in the marketplace on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left - handed movement of the students was shooting roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by granting all students monthly strength and by opening up more free public schools.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of academic opportunities attract youths to criminal revolutions.
The United States should double capital for artificial intelligence
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the budget it's in research in that field, the inventor and artificial intelligence user, Kai-Fu Lee, who's worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The panels were said after various U.S. agencies issued reports of artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal artificial intelligence program.
However, China announced its plan last year: It aims to be first in innovation with artificial intelligence for 2030.
“ It would be a good start to double the budget that goes on artificial intelligence, ” said Lee, “because all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the United States, twice the possibility that the next major discovery of artificial intelligence might be made, Lee told CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Siricon Valley and the New World Order, ” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is director of the Sinovation Ventues, who has invested in Face+, one of the top artificial intelligence companies in China.
He worked on an artificial intelligence system in the '80s at Carnegie Mellon University, who won the best U.S. player in Othello, and later he was director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Department at Google.
Lee spoke of earlier technical competitions held by U.S. government authorities, such as the robot competition of the Defense Department, asking when the next race would be held to identify the nearest pioneers.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to gain strength from the government, Lee.
“ It’s not China that grabs the most important minds, it's the companies, ” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired geniuses from college to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigrant policy may also help the United States to strengthen their artificial intelligence.
“ I feel that if you have a Ph.D. in artificial intelligence, you should have an automatic visa, ” he said.
In July 2017, China's Congress published its future fossilized scheme.
The National Science Foundation and similar government agencies do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a artificial intelligence center designed to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee of artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for NSF, it invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence studies.
At the same time, U.S. legislation, which was designed to create security advice on artificial intelligence, has continued for months.
The Macedonians vote in a national vote as to whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday national votes to change the country's name to the “Roman Empire of Macedonia ” in an attempt to resolve decades of conflict with Greece, which has closed their application to EU and Nato membership.
Greece has a province of Macedonia, claiming that the name of their neighbors in the north equals the requirement for their territory and therefore refuses to enter Nato and the EU.
In June the two governments reached an agreement based on the new name, while nationalistic opposers claim that the change will undermine the identity of the majority of Macedonian people.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote and campaign to ignore it has raised doubts about 50 percent of the minimum required, so that the vote is valid.
The question of the vote is, “Would you like to walk into Nato and the EU by agreeing with Greece?"
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, supporters of the noun change, say that this is a fair price for Macedonia to be taken into allies such as the EU and Nato, one of the people formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“ I came today to vote for the future of our country for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live free under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us, ” said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, enough members of the Parliament have said that they will abide by it and bind it into law.
The nod change would require two thirds of the Senate.
The Concert Committee said that there was no unusual announcement at 1 :00 in the afternoon.
However, when 66 percent of registered voters voted, the participation in the final election was only 16 percent, based on 34 percent.
“ I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe, ” said a 62 - year - old voter in the capital city of Skopje.
The prime minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaav, his wife Zorica, and their son Lushko voted in the Macedonian national vote on whether to change the name of the country, which would pay its way into Nato and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before the Summit in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, worked on preparing small fields and setting up chairs in front of tents that had been constructed by those who will ignore the vote.
Kavardarkov said, “We're in favor of Nato and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not pass through the service door. ”
“ We are poor land, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, there's something else we can turn to like China or Russia and become part of the Euracian relationship."
Prime Minister Zaev says that participation in Nato will move needed funds to Macedonia, where the percentage of job jobs is more than 20 percent.
“ I believe the vast majority will agree that over 80 percent of the population is in favor of the EU and Nato, ” said Zaev after voted.
He said that consent would be “a confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from a Macedonian policy study showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the national votes, but that is less than the minimum required.
Another poll from the Telma TV TV broadcast showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said yes.
So that the national vote is valid, attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious blow to the government’s policy that is in favor of the West since its first May of last year.
See: Sergio Agaero, player of Manchester City, goes through all the defenses of Brighton and scores.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling eased the defense of Brighton in the Manchester City victory at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Agaero made it look ridiculously easy when he cut his mark over 65 minutes.
At the beginning of the parish, the Argentineski campaign received a delivery in the middle of the field.
He sprinted past the three defenders of Brighton and then went off to the open field.
Then Agaero became surrounded by four green defenders.
He got past one defender and then ran away from a few more just to the damned Brighton.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English front army used the first contact within the suite to send the ball back to Aguiro, who used his right leg to play at Mathew Ryan, goaler Brighton, with a shot in the right side of the finish line.
“ Aguero has some leg problems, ” said Pep Guardiola, director of City, to reporters.
“ We talked about his acting 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky he cut his mark at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the big league show.
That's what happened in the 29th minute.
Aguiro got a load deep inside Brighton's fieldside in that parish.
He sent a great long ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane kicked the ball a few times and sent it to Sterling toward the distant pole.
The front of City sent the ball into the net just before it slipped out.
City's playing against Hoffenheim at 12.55, Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play out versus Rockies.
Since the Nationals have been excluded from the outcome, there was no reason to force another beginning.
But the zealous Scherzer hopes to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a chance to get to the finals, but they have a one-time lead over Los Angeles Dodges in the West Division.
Rockies got at least a "wilcard" seat with their 5-2 victory at the Nationals on Friday night, but the people still endeavored to catch their first division title.
“ Even if we play free games, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver as well as for the rest of the team who are sure to play their best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete in such a situation?"
The Nationals will still report who will be the first to throw in the game of Sunday, but they are expected to throw Scherzer in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to start a 34th time, took a rehearsal session on Thursday and would throw on a Sunday which is usually a Sabbath for him.
This right-handed pitching for Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strokes for 220 2/3 rounds during this season.
Trump Visites West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the case around Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court of Justice, when he spoke of the importance of the involvement of Republican supporters in the mid-season election.
“ Everything is at stake in November.
It's five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big... I don't volunteer, but I do, but that's why I'm going around to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: “You can see this terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see that happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see the cruelty, wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go to to get power and control, they just want power and control, we don't give them that.
He said that Democrats are working to “stop and stop. ”
“ And it has been seen in the last four days, ” he said, and said Democrats, “are“ angry and wicked and cruel and untrue."
He named Senator Dianne Feinstein, the dominant Democrat in the Senate Board, a name, and was answered by a loud baulum from the audience.
“ Do you remember her reply?
Was it you who leaked the document?
What?
No, look, I waited in one... it was really bad body language, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an tolerant church.
He Can’t Hate Those Who Express Their Mind
When the actions of the Momentum of my party chose to give me a rebuke, it hardly surprised me.
After all, I'm the last of many members of the Labour Party who've been told we're not welcome, just for expressing our minds.
Joan Afran, a member of my council, received similar treatment because she strongly objected to prejudice against the Jews.
In my case, I was suggested to make a recommendation because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe, was ironicly similar to that of Jeremy, who disagreed with former leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to leave out and be effective. ”
In my eight - year career as a member of the Labour Party, Friday meetings have often been just that.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of “more important and better ” politics has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has been increasingly apparent that different views have not been passed in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged by whether the leaders of the class feel acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I formerly thought had similar political views as I did, began to expect me to take a complete reversal and support of views that I had never agreed, whether it was about national security or the common EU market.
Every time I speak publicly -- it doesn't matter what I say -- it follows the creeping detestable things on the community centers called after my expulsion, the central politics denied, and told me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, since most of the comments I get to me are usually political.
I admire professionalism and the steadfastness of those who have to endure a sexual or prejudiced offense every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing factors in this political era is the natural part of everyday life that attacks and insults have become.
Jeremy Corbyn last week said that the Labour Party should care for the tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a tolerant church, and with every mistrustful design or change in selection, the group becomes increasingly narrow.
For the last two years, I've been counseled not to be too loud, and then I'd be ‘ OK. ’
But I did not decide to take part in politics to do so.
From the time I became a member of the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of Thatcher’s government who left my classroom in a decommissioned state, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in the city council or at council.
I've never committed my political views, nor have I committed my last election.
No one in Nottingham East can have any doubt about my policy reviews and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal Friday morning, I would only like to say that when the country is going to Brexit, which will damage home, business, and public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my only message, which I want to send from me, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my district, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not: I'm serving you with pride, and I promise that no threats of deviation or political disfellowshipping will cause me to refrain from doing what I believe to be for the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Team Ayr goes to the top
Two late contact targets might have clouded the final results of something, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory part in this extremely enjoyable game of the day in the Tenent's Premiership League.
They are now at the top of the list, and one of the ten team members is still undefeated.
Eventually, it was their stronger defense and their better use of opportunities that made the locals victorious, and Coach Peter Murchie had the right to be happy.
“ We've had severe opposition in our games until now and are still undefeated, so I must be happy, ” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “There is nothing to be commended for, they have made better use of their opportunities than we have,"
Mark Grant Anderson arrived at 14 minutes after Frazier Climo turned the offensive, while a yellow card on the Scottish captain, who was allowed to play the game with Warriors, enabled Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot to score the touchdown.
Climo increased the lead of Ayr by hell before he scored just before halftime and then a touchdown, and Ayr came across 17-5 at halftime.
However, Melrose, after Baggot’s return to the parish, began his second half act with force, and Patrick Anderson’s touchdown, after Baggot’s limit, reduced to five points.
Ayr still increased his lead with a touchdown from St. James McDoll, after Clamo turned the parish.
Bilir Macpherson, captain of Ayr, later got the yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of a man with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine at the end of a hard drive.
The locals, however, came back strong, and when Strutan Hutchinson received the yellow card for the achievement of Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the Ayr parish, after an extra kick.
Climo turned the offensive around, as he did again immediately after the regeneration, after Kyle Rowe captured David Amrstrong's kick from a suite and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the fifth touchdown of the team.
The Star of Still Game Parts ready for a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems ready to move to a restaurant business after he found out that he was the manager of a restaurant company.

The team has announced that the future '80s will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan has plans for his life after Craiglang.
On official records, he's the director of Amiforn Limited.

“ The Sea is ours ”: The coastless Bolivian land hopes that a court will open the way back to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are guarding the fleet's headquarters in La Paz.
A general construction flag for a blue flag.
Fleets from Titicaca, to the Amazon River, mark the slogan: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to regain it."
In fact, throughout the 19th - century bloody conflict of Bolivia, the memory of the coastal line lost to Chile, still freshly reminded — as well as the desire to sail around the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Hague on October 1, after five years.
“ Bolivia, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a natural diplomati, “has the power, unity spirit, and chaos, and, of course, wait for the decision with a positive mind. ”
Many people of Bolivia will observe the decision of the International Court on large national screens, hoping that the Court of Hague will judge Bolivia in favor of their claim that Chile is obliged to give Bolivia access after decades of difficult conversation.
The decision on Monday is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the Indian family, who will be involved in a controversial re-election campaign next year.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised late in August.
However, some analysts feel that the court would not decide in favor of Bolivia, and if he did so, it would be of little consequence.
The Court, with headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to give land from Chile, and has stated that the decision will not influence the results of possible discussions.
The fact that the Court’s decision comes only six months after the final talks indicate that the case “had not been complicated, ” said Paz Sárat, international expert.
It is also possible that in the last four years, Bolivia was not a target but, rather, a return to the land.
“ Bolivia’s current government has stolen the ocean issue, ” said Zariet.
Morale's warlike remarks have diminished all the well - meaning from Chile, she counted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged in their couriers.
Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and the representative of the country of Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken a very short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up for a new relationship with Chile, ” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue as a political crutch.
“ Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
“ The cut is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past. ”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear launch unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, says that the land will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave his talk at the UN General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His comments are now arriving when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of Foreign Affairs, appears to be about to resume a nuclear debate more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea.
Ri says that it is “dreaming ” to think that continued commercial industry and protesting the United States against a declaration of the Korean War’s end will ever be brought to the knees of North Korea.
Washington won't accept the statement unless Pyongyang first takes clear action to eliminate his nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, wants to see each other again at another meeting.
However, there are deep doubts that Pyongyang is serious about taking down a weapon that is likely to be the only way to ensure his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
fashion shows in Paris introduce the latest line of large headwear that will come into fashion studios near you.
If you want to expand your hat set or be completely hidden from the sun, you do not have to look further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers showed a variety of strange hats in oversizes for their SS19 line in the fashion field that fascinated the jet crew on the fashion week in Paris.
Instagrams have been published in summer, and these designers have had their novel creations to demonstrate their fashion vision.
Valentino’s main work was a large light brown hat with broad bars that resembled feathers and covered the heads of the modelry.
Among other surfaces, watermelons could be seen in the form of precious stones, laurel hats, and even pineapples, but these items are not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also introduced many strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had condensed lips, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One mask resembled a scuba device with a nassic tube and glasses, while others resembled an acute ice cream in bread form.
If you want customs in your fashion, you're lucky.
fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be sold in fashion shops near you.
Large hats come a little on the heels of a la Bomba, a straw hat with over 60cm large bars that have adorned their heads from Rih Panna to Emily Ratajowski.
The fashion mark behind the very incorrigible hat seen in all social media was the inspiration of another large accessory that appeared in the fashion field — a high - school beach bag almost as large as the swimsuited model that bore it.
The orange straw bag, with a straw and white leather handle, was the main object in La Riviera SS10 clothing line of Jacques during the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, a novelist of famous people, said in an interview with theEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in fashion stores for the next summer -- since the designer has caused such a great impact, it should be difficult to ignore the follow-up questions in oversize."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
The private schools in Scotland are well - known for their students ’ outstanding successes, and this has continued in 2018 with new, elegant test results, which are still supported by individual and group conflict in sports, art, music, and other community practices.
These schools have up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) premeditated to them, and they strive to give their students and their parents the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen career, and their status as citizens.
As a teacher who can put together and teach by specialized textbooks, we see that new subjects continue to be popular teachers in their schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will touch his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it will touch his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely simply in English to build relationships and trust with people from other lands.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the arts with the highest ratio of students who pass school exams.
68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages got their excellent A.
The data collected from 74 schools in SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received an excellent A in Mandarin score while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received a reading of A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that young people will surely need in the future.
At the present time, language, which is a selection, is placed in the same seat as the scientific study (tech, engineering, and mathematics) in private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey of UK Sources for Employment and Divorce revealed that for the reasons that employers did not have difficulty in recruiting, 17 percent was because of the lack of language skills in people.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future careers.
Already more and more jobs demand knowledge of languages, this ability is needed in a globalized world.
No matter what career people choose, they will have a real future advantage if they learn another language, a skill that lasts the rest of their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person the advantage of the rivals.
According to a 2013 survey of over 4,000 adult Brets, 75 percent of them were unable to speak another language well enough to maintain conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two - letter percent, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest in language education immediately.
The use of polygamy, especially in newly identified lands, will give children a better opportunity to find an important job.
In Scotland, there are different languages between schools.
A certain number of schools will focus on classical innovations, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important to Britain when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, he will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with qualified teachers.
Schools of colleges commitment to offer a study environment, which will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to achieve success, no matter what the future will bring.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global commercial environment, language continues to be necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be viewed as “an international skills in communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer options, diversity, and superiority for youths of Scotland.
I love bien le faire.
John Edwards is president of the Scottish High School.
LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of Lakers, reported that James will play Sunday during the opening season versus Denver Nuggets, San Diego.
It has not yet been determined in how many minutes he will play.
“ It will be longer than one minute and less than 48 minutes, ” Walton said at the official website of Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After earlier this week's practice, James was asked in his plans for six game games of Laker before the beginning of the season.
“ During this period of my career, ” he said, “I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare for myself.
Time for a campaign meeting in West Virginia and the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will host a number of campaigns and the first is tonight in Wheling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop in hostile places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now, when the vote to confirm his choice of a new Supreme Court judge has been suspended, Trump aims to build up support for the next middle election, because Republicans are at risk of losing control of the council when votes are voted in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheed, West Virginia, is due to begin at 7:00 an Eastern class tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below through the live transmission of YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the trial of Brett Kavanagh, the Supreme Court's Committee, where there was tension due to sexual harassment, the vote of the Senate to confirm him as a judge was courted for up to a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the main goal of the meetings at Trump is to help Republicans recover from better lands, but they are faced with difficult elections in November.
Thus, the message from Trump’s campaign that the five meetings that will be held next week were aimed at “filling volunteers and supporters of enthusiasm as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority of the Senate and council members, ” according to Reuter’s news agency.
“ The head of the council is so necessary for the President's plan that he will travel to as many states as possible when a busy campaign season begins," said an uncalled spokesman from Trump's campaign to the Reuters news agency.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheing, and supporters are expected to come from the “Ohi and Pennsylvania and that the Pittsburgh news media report it, ” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's meeting will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, but he won over 40 percent of the difference in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to assist Patrick Morrissey, a candidate of Republicans in West Virginia to the Senate, but it's a little lower in polls.
“ It’s not good for Morrissey that the president has to come and try to increase his popularity, ” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters' News.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team is willing to keep the hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one - sided laps, the four - sided game, which was Saturday afternoon, could be just what we needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
The swing of success is a sporting concept that has been invented and that the players truly believe in, and never more than the contests like this.
Where would they say that they now have success?
“ They had a six-point head start, and now it's four points, so the success goes rather on our side now, I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he set off in the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has a head start, four points ahead with another 12 at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, believe they have a little wind in their sails, and they can be hopeful of many things, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each got three points of four.
Spieth has played a great game, ranging from flat to flat, leading by her example.
The vowels rose as the ring went, and he put down a very important pillow to track all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points under two games.
His pillow, which gave them victory in the 15th hole, received a similar shout of joy, of the kind that tells you that he still believes that the American team still has a victory hope.
“ You just have to dive deep and think about your own game, ” said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to enter a score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakably story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but fascinating European couple has won four out of four games and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who got school on Saturday afternoon, but they also managed to avoid sewage on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and on the nine hollow field on Friday morning.
That game and how their energy seem to flow both to and from the loud audience clearly shows that they are the pair that must win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molina, when the sun sits over Lelf National Stadium.
The best option would be that both of them did it at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the triumph of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went easy with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the Fourth of the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
Swede and two doubles in the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swedish into a hole they could never scratch.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the four are so exciting to watch in close touch because of the communication between the couple, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how a play - game plan can change into a single blow.
Europe has played better as a team up until now, and has a considerable advantage for the final day, but this quadrilogy also showed that the American team has the wish that some had doubts that it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a fine head start for the Ryder Cup’s final day after the four ball and the fourness of Saturday, with a head start of 10-6 against the United States.
Star dupleging Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who were in trouble, and have had four points on Le Golf National Stadium.
The European team of Thomas Bjorns, who would like to get back the prize trophy, which he lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed a far superior advantage over the United States' team in the Fourth Ball Game of the morning and won 3-1.
The United States had a greater resistance to the four games and won two games, but it did not reach the score line.
Jim Furky's team required eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European team to win four points in a row, and he and Molina, who got the nickname "Mollwood" after a great weekend, are only the second couple who win four points from their first four games in the Ryder Cup history.
After complete defeat of Woods and Patrick Reed in the four ball game, they showed a great team, working downwood's hatch and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who drew himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius on rare occasions, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four ball games and four games and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the four-ball game of the morning, returned to his partner, Henrik Stonson in the fours, and worked 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka -- who are first and third in the list of the best golfers in the world.
Europe, however, was not in the best interests of this mild and prosperous day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions of golf, Jordan Spirit, and Justin Thomas set the goal for the United States on Saturday.
They worked with difficulty 2-1 against Jon Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in four ball games and later came back and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the four games after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup that a team won four points at the beginning of an individual race, although Furks ’ team would need only a tie to continue the trophy.
However, after two days of the second best, a countermeasure on Sunday seems to be beyond their reach.
North Korea says one-sided desensitization of "can't be" without trust
On Saturday, the North Korea Minister of Foreign Affairs told the UN that their lack of confidence in the United States was limited to continued business support, and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons in one side under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “an important measure of well - meaning ” during the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and rocket testing, taking down the nuclear testing site, promising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“ We have seen no consistent response from the United States, ” he said.
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty of our country’s safety, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons first. ”
Although Ri has repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to "stratified" approach to nuclear weapons where the North Korea would be rewarded for every step that it took, his statement seemed special in that he did not deny one - sided nuclear weapons pure out as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between presidents of the United States and Northocress, in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work on the “nuclear weapon of Koreacan ” and Trump made a promise to secure the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has sought a solution to bring a formal end to Korea War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang has to leave his nuclear weapons behind first.
Washington has also met with appeals to relax a strict business ban against North Korea.
“ The United States insists that ‘ nuclear weapons be first ’ and increase the pressure by using a business book to achieve its own way, and even protesting the declaration of ending the war, ’ said Ri.
“ It’s only fantasy people who know nothing about us that a customer can get us down.
But the problem is that continued business support adds to our distrust."
Ri didn't mention any plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, referred to by the U.S. leader earlier this week.
Instead of speaking of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea in the last five months, the minister added: “If the party was to replace this nuclear weapon, South Korea would not be this stand in the case of nuclear weapons in Korea."
In spite of this, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year when he said at the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to aim missiles from North Korea to the United States mainland after “the devilish President ” Trump called Kim“ a rocketman ” for suicide.
Last year Trump threatened to “rescue ” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim of the United Nations for his courage to take steps toward disarming, but he said that there was still much work to be done and that commercial industry would remain until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this and said: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months -- it doesn’t matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday, said: “The security council's business has to continue until total nuclear launch has taken place and confirmed."
The Security Council agreed to increase trades at North Korea from 2006 to shut down the funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said after that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for doing “crime demands. ”
In those months, North Korea promised a meeting with Moon to take down a missile area and a nuclear plant if the United States resorted to “the equivalent action. ”
He said that Kim had told him that the “corresponding operations ” he sought were the guarantees of safety promised by Trump in Singapore and the actions toward normal relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard attend a course of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to counteract the growing tendency of students to stay awake and learn all night with caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little or nothing when it comes to the basics of self - concern.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, developed the course, and believes that it sees the first of its species in the United States.
After giving a lecture on the effects of sleeplessness, he had the idea of doing the course.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl approached me and asked, “Why am I told this first now, in my senior year? ”
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep which surprised me," he said to the Telegraph.
The first study of this year’s study explains the basics of good sleep habits helping students to develop learning skills and sports skills and even to promote general well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of mental - health professionals at Harvard Medical School and the Director of Hospital Services, said that after learning that students were very sleepy during the week, the university had decided to study the course.
It is an hour - long course that includes effective projects.
In one section, there is a picture of a boarding room, where students snap on coffee, curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance can worsen when they are in need of sleep, as well as the importance of good sleep routines.
In other parts, subjects are told how long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“ We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we feel they have the right to know this, just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that favors those who stay awake and learn all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students meant that sleeplessness is a growing problem.
The guarantee of getting enough sleep of good things should be “secret weapons ” for students to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, as sleeplessness increases the desire of the brain to eat, so that the body is hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old professor of chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler set up his course together, one of the professor's cows of the first year of Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a class for all students at school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all teachers to complete a similar course before they begin their studies at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting alarm clocks, reminding them to go to sleep, and to wake them, and to bear in mind the harmful effects from blue light that electronic screens and LED lights give away, which can confuse their internal clocks and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark of Mega shoots down Gerrard's men
Rangers were still having trouble in the field as Stevens Gerrard's divided team had to accept the 1-0 loss of Livingston, after target from Dolly Menga.
Ibrox's team wanted to win its first victory in the field after his victory at St Johnstone in February; but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard's team only his second loss in his 18 games as manager. It's now eight points behind Hearts, which is at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiersship League.
Men scored seven minutes before Ranger’s half, and Ranger’s team seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to recover.
Rangers now fall to sixth position, while Livingston goes up to the third and is only followed by Hibernian in its limitations.
Rangers might be in further trouble after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for head injury after some object was thrown into it from the guest field half.
Gerrard made eight changes for the team that swept Ayr away and got the semifinal at the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, stayed with the same Livi 11 installation that reached a score of Hearts last week and he had been pleased with the way his well - trained teammen chose to cross the resistance.
Rangers may have been more involved with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball it reached.
They should have scored just two minutes after the play started when the first shipment from Menga came in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but he blew it past.
A long extra kick from Keaghan Jacobs then ended up with Craig Halkett, but his defense companion, Alan Litagow, shot past the far side.
Rangers regained control of the game, but they seemed to live in hope rather than believe in their game in the final part of the game.
In fact, Alfredo Morales felt that he should have got hell when he and Steven Lawless were past the game, but Judge Steven Thomson referred to the Colombian call.
Rangers only reached two targets in the first half but Liam Kelly, former goaler Ibrox, did not have to have much to protect the baldness of Lassana Coulibly and easy shots from Ovie Ejaria.
Even though Livi’s 34th - minute opportunity had come, no one can deny that they deserved it, but only because of their persistence.
Rangers failed again to make anything out of Jacob's long extra kicks.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose to send Menga, which then easily challenged.
Gerrard took action at halftime and sent Ryan Kent into instead of Coulibly, and the exchange was almost immediate when the porter put Morelos in, while Kelly quickly responded and ran forward to shut the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to beat the guests to play just the kind of game they enjoy playing, and Litashow and Halkett caught up with one long shipment after another.
Holt's team could have added to his lead at the final minute, but McGregor did well in refusing Jacobs for an opportunity before Lithgow ran to target from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Ranger's lip, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell down together, but Thomson dismissed it again.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a page from our calendar “Sundy Morning ”: 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today and AFFECTA... this is the day born in Germany as future Physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans. ” Geiger.
Geiger developed a procedure to study and measure radioactivity, and that invention eventually led to a device called Geiger.
The Geiger scale has established a solid place in the science world since then but was also popular in pop culture, for example, in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado" with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
A man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers wrote: “This is Geiger, used to find radioactive material, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on you, you can hear the effects from the atoms due to radioactivity in the rocks."
Evans: “It really is now! ”
His “Hans ” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new anticancer vaccine can teach your immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new anticancer vaccine can teach your immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches your immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of your treatment
The treatment consists of taking immune cells out of the patient and changing them to a laboratory
Then they can see a protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and is then injected back into the patient
Study trial vaccine has shown positive results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to recognise dangerous cancer cells.
The procedure involves taking immune cells out of the patient and turning them into a laboratory so that they can “see ” a protein called HER2 and found in many types of cancer, then re-injecting the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States Cancer Institute at Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our situation suggests that the vaccine is extremely effective.
HER2 “makes various cancers stop growing, ” including breast, ovary, lung, and colorectal cancers, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure in which immune cells are taken from patients and the “compromised” to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.

It didn't end well
The Kanye West of the studio in Saturday Night Live, after a long - held talk, commended Donald Trump President and said that he would volunteer for president of the United States in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he carried Make America Great derhua, he long spoke against the Democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
“ I’ve talked so often to white people who say, ‘ How can you like Trump, he's racist? ’
If I was worried about racial hatred, I'd be moved from the United States long ago," he said.
SNL started with a trailer where Hollywood Star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanagh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on sexual harassment accused Christine Bresey Ford.
Although West was not sent out, its footage was placed on a community media of comedian Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had received a bad welcome backstage because of his hat.
“ I was bullied backstage.
They said to me, “Don’t go up to the stage with that hat. ”
They bullied me!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to the Washington Examiner news.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole?" and said that he would put on his superhero robe, “because this means that you cannot command me to do it.
Try love."
According to Variety, his comments were met with a bath from the audience at least twice, and the actors SNL seemed embarrassed, and one of them attended the newspaper said: “There was a silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many when he sang the song I Love It, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, chairman of the conservative class TPUSA, who stated on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: BUT THUGH FOR THE THUGUE MEGAN. ”
But Karen Hunter’s chat shop said on Twitter that West was simply being “he himself and that is absolutely wonderful. ”
“ But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or his clothing or by supporting his “list ”) that I think will support and spread an ideologies that are damaging to my community.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was “a creature once known as Knye West. ”
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion, and the music legend Prince made his name a symbol, later called himself the former artist known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the star of the Kunu Games, criticism of the poisonous males
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventure show from the HBO, The Kruval Games.
However, 31 - year - old actor has been critical of the male hero, saying that such roles on the screen often mean that young boys often feel that they have to be hard on themselves to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that “something went wrong ” and wondered how to deal with the problem of poisonous males during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married her actress from the Muppet Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong opinions ” on how to deal with this situation.
"Personally, I feel that right now -- What has gone wrong with being male?"
“ What have we taught men in their growing up, about the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for an increase in poisonous manhood, because of a very manly person on television.
He continued: “What is born with birth, and what is taught?
What are taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel as if they must be made of a man?
I think it's one of the most important questions of our day -- How do we change this?
Because it's obvious that something's gone wrong in young men."
He also admitted during the interview that he would not play in any other Muppet show after the next summer's series of factors and said that he had received “no field or horse. ”
From November on, Kit will play in regeneration of True West, a picture by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about playing at The Muppet Games is having met his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these factors, so they gave me my future family and my life after that, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's lover that Kit played in this Emmy Award program.
The couple married in June 2018, in Lesliar’s family in Scotland.
HIV/secretion: China reports a 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people who are infected with HIV or who have AIDS.
Health officials say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported only on the second quarter of the year 2018.
The vast majority of new infections were transmitted by sexual contact, which is a change from previous sources.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly into some parts of China because of donors on contaminated blood.
In contrast, the number of HIV infections infected in this way has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese health professionals said at a Yunnan County conference.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still much discrimination against LGBT people.
Due to conservative values in the country, research estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections are caused by insufficient contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, China's government has promised access to all HIV products as part of a plan to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters deny that an employee leaked data from Republican senators, critical of “dangerous lies ” and“ conspiracy theories ”
Maxine Waters, a senator denied the charge that one of her employees had published the personal information of three senators of the Republican Party on their Wikipedia websites.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that these statements came from “supersurrendered ” fanatics and Web sites.
“ Lies, lies, and more miserable lies, ” said Waters in a declaration on Twitter.
The information published, according to address and number of American congressmen Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday from an unknown party at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate at Brett Kavanagh, the Committee of Supreme Courts, on account of sexual harassment charges.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Integrated pages such as Gateway Putit and Redstate said that the IP numbers that identify the source of the information have been linked to Water's office and published information about one of her employees, based on Capitol Hill information.
“ This false charge is absolutely false and pure lies, ” continued Waters.
“ My employer -- what personal information and security are now in danger because of these false accusations -- was in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This false charge is absolutely false and pure lies."
Water’s statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ara Fleischer, former White House reporter.
“ This denial is full of anger, ” Fleischer wrote.
“ This suggests that she does not have a temper to sit in.
When someone is accused without cause, we must not respond with anger.
There is no need to be opposed.
We cannot ask for reasons that blame us.
You have to be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters' response to the criticism of Democrat on the Kavanagh judge, who the critics said that the trial had seemed too angry on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the candidate Republicans against Waters in the mid - season election, also expressed his opinion of the Twitter.
“ Big deal if it's true, ” he hung.
In his declaration, Waters stated that her office “has made known these false claims to the authorities and law - enforcement officials.
“ We will ensure that the guilty will be found, ” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all the acts that are destructive and dangerous for all my employees."
A film critic for Johnny English Strykes discipline - a spy-grin movie with Rowan Atkinson is weak
It has become the habit of searching for British reference in all new forms of Britain, and it seems to apply in this reviving of the Johnny English comic series - that began in 2003 with Johnny English and just came back to life in 2011 with the Johnny English Reborn film.
Will this woman sitira think of how clearly we are a new export tool for the country?
Whether it is or not, the adulterer, greasy, and clumsy Johnny English have been granted renewed permission for the second time to mess up everything -- his name is above all that he is designed for a performance in other than English - speaking countries.
Of course, he's the wise, secret serviceer who claims to have charming charms, but he's a little bit of Clouseau's concoct of that Mr Bean and a little sledge of the man who played the only note for the Charts of Fire at the London Olympic Festival in 2012.
It is also originally based on the tourist and the mysterious mayor Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, where he left everything in chaos.
There is one or two fine points in this latest Johnny English movie.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English wear a medieval bramble and the helicopter blades blow his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his humor, but the sense of humor seems rather insensitive and strangely superficial, especially now that “serious ” movies such as James Bond and MissionImpossibility also offer without hesitation to laugh.
The joke seems to be more for children than for adults, and I thought the adventures Johnny English got into not the same idea as that of Mr. Beans' silent joke box.
The eternal basis for the film today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has managed to break into Britain's secret spy net and has identified the identity of all British spies, to a great deal of trouble for the agent who's on the watch -- unfortunately, that's where Kevin Eldon comes in for too little.
This is the final stage for the prime minister, who is a haughty and controversial person and already in great trouble because of the tremendous political hostility: Emma Thompson does his best with his role as a person to remind Theresa May, but the manuscript is not a list of fish for her.
Her advisers tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had retired.
And there comes Johnny English himself, now the principal of some fancy school, but also provides a secret lesson in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes, which English offers to a spy school that reminds us of School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall to an emergency meeting and meets Bough, his former long-lost partner, Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in that energyy role, Vicki Pepperdine does not quite let his light shine.
The Christmas twin that messes everything up in Her Majesty's service is back in gear and meets the dangerous cry of Ophelia Bulletovu, the game of Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister is fascinated by the magic of the fascinating billionaire within the technical sector, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: it is the evil Jason Volta, the game of Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their symmetry: they set fires to a fine French restaurant disguised as servants, creating a charge when they smuggle in Volta’s luxury yacht, and English turns everything upside down when trying to use virtually visible glasses to study the interiors of Volta’s house.
There's no savings in the finals, but even if the picture is live and energy, it's a bit of baby stuff in it as a whole.
Medium stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn't help but think: Can a British movie industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his abilities?
The union refuses to create a four - day schedule for the British, with the same salary as it was five days ago.
The union, led by Jeremy Corbyn, now ponders a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the report, the category wants to make corporate managers use savings produced by the revolution in artificial intelligence and to make workers benefit by getting a day off.
If so, workers may spend three days on long weekends without less pay.
Sources say that the idea would “pass ” on the category’s economy and its policy of improving the welfare of workers.
Trades Union Congress has been supporting the short working week for four days, as a way for workers to make changes in their economy.
A member of the upper union of the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that policy reviews will be announced by the end of the year.
“ The change will not take place overnight, but four days of work is a goal that matches the approach of the category to change the economy for the workers and for the class’s overall policy. ”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the green party promised four days of work during its campaign in 2017.
The objective, however, is not supported by the entire strike party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: “Four days of work weeks are not on the pack policy sheet, and the party is not considering introductioning it. ”
John McDonnell, the Secretary of Justice, used the Labour Party conference last week to describe his ideas about social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from “unknown presidents ” and“ cults ” of corporations.
The aims of the Minister of Shadows also mean that the current shareholders in water - irrigation companies may not be able to get all their share back, since the Labour Party’s government could put on “delivered ” because of alleged errors.
He has also confirmed plans to place workers in the Commission and create a common holding fund to give 10 percent of the private companies' property to their staff, who could get 500 pounds of them annually in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say, "60 minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanagh could induce them to change their minds.
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week long delay in the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, and raised the question of whether its findings could bring back the senators of Republicans.
During a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, a reporter in the “60 Minutes, ” asked Republicans and senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“ I mean, of course, ” said Kennedy.
“ I said when the trial began, ” I said, “I talked to Judge Kavanah.
I called him after the charges were made, and I asked him, “Did you do this?
He was firm, steadfast, unconvincing."
Graham’s act, however, seems unchanging.
“ I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanagh and it would take an amazing charge to change it, ” he said.
“ Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this is what I know: Brett denied it firmly, ” said Graham, addressing Christine Bresey Ford.
“ And all the people she mentioned could not confirm that name.
This case is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new going to change."
What is the international Civil Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The International Civil Cities Festival will be held Saturday in New York, a annual music event in which a superstar series will appear and with a similar dramatic direction; ending poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year that the International Civil Festival is held, and tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park, not only to listen to music from including Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to bring an end to extreme poverty for 2030.
The International Civil Party, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight it.
To obtain a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for the VIP ticket), musicians had to complete a number of tasks, or “actions, ” such as doing volunteer work, e - mailing one of the world’s leaders, calling a phone call, or using other valid means of helping them to draw attention to their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the festival been, now that there are 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of winning people with free concerts really a way to convince people to call for action, or is this just but one so-called "clicking" - where people think they do something that matters by signing a list of requirements online or sending a message to Twitter?
Global Citiesen reports that since 2011 it has recorded over 19 million “actions ” from its supporters, in order to call for many different objectives.
It says that these measures helped to make the world’s leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to $35 billion that will affect life over 2.25 billion for 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements for his actions, including investing or collecting at least 10 billion dollars.
The group estimates that the funds collected have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a union of investors and executives in Britain who, after receiving 4700 messages from Global Citizens, “helping children to enjoy their full lives, ” promises to give 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country.
“ With support from Britain’s government, sponsors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can make the social injustices of malnutrition the past, ” said Tracey Ullmann, representing The Power of Nutriion to audiences at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 pleas were sent that Britain should improve feeding for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
For a list of common questions on the team’s website, one question is, “Why do you think you can end up in poverty? ”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult project - sometimes we will fail all the time.
But, we will reach our goal, just as movement that fought for citizens' rights and execution of racial separation before us, for we are stronger together.
Among the people who present this year at the event are Janet Jackson, the Weekand, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York, and the introductions are Deborah-Lourness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to block Russia's energy export, says Internal Affairs.
“ If necessary, ” says Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of State, according to a Washington Examiner report, Washington could use Washington to prevent energy from reaching the market.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s assistance in Syria, especially where the land works in the hands of the legitimate government there, would be a stipulation to explore the new market.
“ I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is then that they want to do business with energy, as in Eastern Europe and southern Europe, ” he should have said according to his sources.
And, according to official announcement, there are ways and methods to resist it.
“ The United States can use the Navy to make sure that sea roads are open and to form an obstacle, if necessary, to make sure that their energy does not come into the market, ” he said.
Zinke addressed a gathering at the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group that calls himself “the voice of the energy consumer ” in the United States.
He continued and compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said it was more or less the same.
“ The economic advantage for Iran and Russia is more and less practical for energy sources and to exchange them for others," he said, and he said that Russia has only one card in memory with economics dependent on fossil fuels.
The information follows that Trump's government wants to increase its export of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a much cheaper alternative for European consumers.
To do this, public employees on Trump’s board, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to cancel participation in the “unacceptable” Nord Stream 2 projects to put on a new energy pipe, which Trump says would make Berlin a“ prisoner ” in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly claimed that Nord Stream 2 is only an economic task, which will double the transport capacity of the current line to 110 billion cubic feet [110 billion cu m].
The Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply moved forward for economic reasons and that it is an example of unreasonable competition.
“ I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Russian energy minister after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. energy minister, in Moscow, September.
The United States has been criticized by Germany, who has confirmed their commitment to the project.
The Federal Industrial Organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has invited the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and two-sided agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“ I'm very unhappy that the external state concerned itself with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industries (BDI) after a meeting recently held with Angelu Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will “consider seriously ” to volunteer for the presidency in 2020, she says
On Saturday, Elizabeth Warren, a senator of Massachusetts, said that she would “consider seriously ” to volunteer for president after the mid - season election.
Warren confirmed that she would consider volunteering for a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“ It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then she also needs a woman as leader, ” she said according to a report from The Hill.
“ After November 6, I will seriously consider presenting myself to the office of the president. ”
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting and said that he was “going to take the country in the wrong direction.
“ I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, ” she said.
Warren has been impressed with his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanagh, his Supreme Court judge.
On Friday, Warren told Twitter that “we have to have the FBI investigate the case before the vote is done."
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of the voters in Warren’s state do not feel that it should be presented in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not volunteer, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent claimed to support her supply.
The poll showed greater support for Deval Patrick, former governor, where 38 percent claimed to support his potential supply and 48 percent said that he was opposed.
Among the other popular Democrats who were discussed for possible presidential campaigns in 2020 were Joe Biden, former vice president, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he was going to make a public decision in January, according to a report from Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks of Track Palin's traumatic stress disorder at a campaign meeting at Donald Trump
Track Palin, aged 26, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“ My son is going through a lot of trouble after he has returned, I feel for other families affected by a traumatic stress disorder and the spiritual wounds our soldiers return home with," she said to the audience at a campaign meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room ” and said that her son and other war soldiers“ return a little different, they are hardened, and wonder if there is any respect for what their fellows in the army and the air forces and other military forces have done for the country. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for trying to prevent the announcement of domestic violence and the use of weapons under the influence of alcohol, as seen by Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wazilla Police Department.
18 Battalion and Washington D.C. support a challenge against new refuge policy
Eighteen state and Washington City support a legal challenge against new U.S. policies that deny victims of gang or domestic violence for asylum.
The 18th and City representatives sent in a court report on Friday, Washington, to support a client who protests the course, according to a report from NBC News.
The full name of the accuser of Grace V. Sesion's attorney, which the American Civilist Liberties Union has not been issued against the federal policy.
She said that her mate “and his violent sons who were members ” were violent, but American government officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
They put her in custody in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where there are ever more problems with gangs and domestic violence than a number of clients in the United States come from these countries.
The new client’s policy cancels a decision issued by the immigrant appeal committee in 2014 to allow the unsolved immigrants who fled from domestic violence to seek asylum.
In a statement by Washington State Attorney Karl Racine, Friday, the new policy “resented more decades of state and international law. ”
“ Federal law insists that the decision be made on all the positions of protection based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this order, ” said the court report.
The police also said that the policy that refused the importers was harmful for America’s economy, claiming that immigrants were more likely to establish companies and “preserve important labour."
In June, General Jeff Sessions ordered court officials to stop providing asylum for victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence.
“ Those leaving their homeland because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or involvement in a certain community or political inspection may seek refuge, ” said Sesions in his announcement of policy on June 11.
There was never an all - out period of problems, not even all serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue measures in a race to find survivors in Palau, who speak the dead double
Conditions become increasingly difficult for survivors.
“ There is a lot of tension in the air, ” said a 35 - year - old mother, the Giant Kusuma, who comforted her sick son in the relief center of Pala.
“ Nurses bring their bodies here all the time.
There's little clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their desolate homes and looking for water - waste resources in an effort to save what they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged after the earthquake measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke the back and shoulder, lay outside the military hospital in Pala, where patients were in favour of continued vigorous aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pressed up to the wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and said his family had been in town to go to the wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “the persecutions ” with the“ propaganda ads ”
A week after a government newspaper in China published a four - page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper to discuss mutual advantages in business between the two countries, U.S. ambassadors in China Peking accused of exploiting the American media to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, spoke on the last Wednesday of the Chinese newspaper’s advertising in Des Moines Register -, the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to get involved in the U.S. congressional election that will become November 6.
Trump's complaint that Beijing wanted to get involved in the U.S. congressional elections was what official U.S. representatives told Reuters' news agency that was a new stage in an expanded campaign from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal that foreign governments published advertising to promote business, Peking and Washington are involved in a chronic commercial war, with new customs on imports from both countries.
Chinese and American experts say that China's revenge in the early business war was designed to damage immigrants in states such as Lowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, ambassador of the United States of China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, but that state exports a lot of agricultural products to China, said Peking had damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
Branstad said in his article in Des Moines Register’s Sunday newspaper that “PRC is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free media. ”
“ By spreading its propaganda, China’s government is taking advantage of the United States’s beloved freedom of speech and our free media by publishing a forced advertisement in the magazine Des Moines Register, ” said Bronstad in his article.
“ There are few protesters on the streets of Beijing, ” he wrote, “and there are no real reflections of the different opinions that the Chinese might have on China’s worried economicism, where the media are trapped in the heels of the Chinese Communist Party. ”
He added that “one of China’s biggest press escaped the offer to publish ” his article, but he did not reveal what magazine it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are making female voters disintegrating them for the midtime election with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid - period elections, because many Republicans have been brief and have defended Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual harassment.
Such strong feelings have been involved, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted to begin a vote.
“ There is no way to back it up, ” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School Institute at the University of Syracuse, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he didn't think that Jeff Flake, the Senator of Republicans in Arizona, in the last minute of an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the voters' anger.
“ Men will not forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow and not in November, ” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the head of authority and the spokesperson for the Moveon liberal group, Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang, “November approaches!" when they protested in the march of the Senate when the Republicans who ruled the decision decided to continue with the appointment of Kavanaughs, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Bersey Ford, according to Myc.
“ The interest and enthusiasm of voters will go out of control, ” said Stu Rothenberg, independent political analyst, on the news page.
“ People will say that the interest has already been intense, and it is true.
But he could be greater, especially in the women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who don't like the President much, but rarely choose."
The analysts predicted a relapse if the Republicans were to press a confirmation of Kavanaugh, even for the testimony of Ford, in which she declared her accusations of sexual harassment from him.
“ It’s become a big mess for the Republican Party, ” said Michael Still, former member of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“ The matter is not only the votes of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it, ” said Guy Cecil, chairman of Prorities USA, a group that helps vote for Democrats, the news station.
On the other hand, the United States seems to disagree with whom to believe by testimony from both Ford and Kavanagh, with the few majority supporting the latter.
A new poll from YouuGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed, or likely the Ford testimony, while 35 percent claimed to believe safely or probably the testimony of Kavanagh.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that they believed Kavanaugh had probably or probably lied in their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the flash call, the FBI is now investigating the charges Ford made and from at least one other woman, Deborah Ramírez, according to a report from Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate decision committee last week and said that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramírez says that Kavanaugh carried her genitals in front of her when they were both at a feast held at Yale University in the 1980 ’ s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans for starting a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to start a wand company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, an open factory for Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are saved and which people are allowed to access which information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joking that the intent behind Inrup was “world domination. ”
“ We have to do this now, ” he said about the wand company.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store" or PoDD.
There you can have a list of contacts, to-do list, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work-related tools.
It is similar to that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slap, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
It is unique to the personal data store that it is entirely up to the user who can access any information.

Bernard Vann: The priest andholder of the Victoria Cross of World War I honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victoria Cross during World War I that a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
Father Bernard Vann, who served as Lieutenant Colonel in the Army, was led by the cross on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellengglese and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper, and he was never told that he had received the highest honor of the British Army.
Two of his grandfather’s sons exposed him in a procession in Rushden, Northamptonshire, Saturday.
One of his great - grandson Michael Vann said that the monument was exactly exposed 100 years from the honors of his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, Vann led his chief military force on September 29, 1918, over Canal de Saint-Quaint cut “through a very thick fog and under a severe shooting from cannons and machine guns."
Later, he ran to the firing line, and with “a great courage, ” he continued the line before he attacked one of his own guns and defeated three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, just one month before the war ended, undertwined a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that the heroism of his grandfather was “something I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the flowers for the procession, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youuth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was “a great honor to join in the procession, ” adding that“ the admiration of the true hero is shown by the support shown by so many. ”
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, got instead to see a gurru pig
Imagine, having woken all night to see a full Bellator 206, just to be denied seeing the big event.
The program had 13 battles from San Jose, six of which were shown live all night in the Channel 5 Channel.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers got a surprise event when the broadcast changed to Gurru pig.
Some were unhappy after staying up all night to see the battle.
One fan of Twitter described the exchange to the children's stuff as “any sort of sick joke. ”
“ In accordance with official regulations, it was not appropriate for viewers at six o’clock in the morning, so they had to switch to child material, ” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication for Bellator when asked for broadcasts.
"Gurgar pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that they would review their time schedules and take viewers in Britain into account in the future.
“ I think when I think of the replay that we could probably sort this out, ” said Coker.
“ But it is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we can’t figure this out until Sunday in our time, which is Monday with them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the transmission was changed, a lot of text messages were sent back and forth, and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't so, it was an official problem.
I can promise you this won't happen the next time.
We limited the night at five fightings instead of six, as usual, but we tried too hard and got ahead of ourselves.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley experienced “mightiness ” as a result of sexual orientation
Olympic scholar Tom Daley said that he had experienced an inadequacy toward other people in their growing up because of his sexuality, but he was encouraged to succeed.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different from others ” until he went to high school.
In Desert Island Island, at Radio 4, with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give “hope. ”
He also said that his role as parents reduced his interest in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular factor manager, has taken several months off because of illness.
Daley said that he was “a smaller man ” than everyone else when he was a child because“ it was not approved in the community to be attracted to both boys and girls. ”
“ Until today, ” he said, “these feelings of being inferior and otherwise given me the strength and strength to succeed, ” he said.
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation ended.
The double Olympic bearholder has made great efforts as a supporters of LGBT and has used his involvement in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said that he heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The World Champion triple said that it was “a surprise to him ” to fall in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar Prize winner, who is 20 years older than he was last year, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
“ When a man goes through so much at an early age, ” he participated in his first Olympic Games at age 14, and his father died of cancer three years later — he said that it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and hardship.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his “all the answers to life ” had taken place.
“ If you had asked me last year, ” he said, “it was all about winning a gold prize. ”
“ You know, there are more important things than a gold medal in the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic medal."
His son is baptized in the head of his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he had asked was if they had received their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in front row.
“ I couldn’t say to him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row, ” he said.
“ When he stopped breathing, I held his hand, and it was only when his breath stopped, and he was told that I finally admitted that he was not invincible, ” he said.
The next year, in the 2012 Olympics, Daley won a bronze prize.
“ All I knew was that I had dreamed about this all my life, to dip in front of the local audience at the Olympics, and it doesn’t feel better, ” he said.
It was also inspired to choose the first song - Proud by Heather Small - who had inspired him to the Olympic Games and had still given him goose skin.
Desert IslandDiscs is on the BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 p.m.
Mickson in bad shape and get on the bench at the Ryder Cup Saturday
The American Phil Mickson will beat his record on Sunday when he plays 47th in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find his old rhythms again so he doesn't have bad memories covered.
Mickson, who plays his 12th World Series, was assigned to sit on the bench after the decision of the captain Jim Furk for the four-ball game and four-players on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as it has been so many times before for the United States, the day was divided by the fivefold champion between being a cheerleader and practicing the games on the field, hoping to correct what's wrong with him.
Mickson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot the slut, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, where long grins often punish for bad shots.
And not only is the golf course a challenge in itself, but Mickson has to compete against Frances Molina, the winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday, with newly joined Tommy Fleetwood and together they have won all four games this week.
If the Americans who are four points under when they take the first game of 12 monomers, get a good start, Mick's game could make a difference.
Fur dust expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“ He fully understood the role he had today, clapped my back, and held my arms and said he'd be ready tomorrow, ” said Fur dust.
“ He has great confidence.
He's in the Hall of Fame, and he's been such a help for the past and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I could see more, but that's how it ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everybody else."
Mickson will beat Nick Faldo's record in a lot of games at the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could lead to the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never reached just as much as other achievements in his record.
Mickson has 18 victories, 20 taps, and 7 draw, but Furky said his presence had a vague effect on the past.
“ He's funny, he's cynical, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and it's great to have him in the teamroom, ” he explained.
“ I think that the younger players loved to tease him too this week, and it was fun to see.
He's giving so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Byrn, Europe's captain knows that much advantage may disappear quickly.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dan was first played in Valderrama in 1997, where a gate under the command of the Commander Seve Ballerstos had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but he managed to squeeze right forward the final victory with the least possible stairways, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
“ You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama, we had a big head start at Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but only right then," said Bjórn, who is seen on the picture, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 both Friday and Saturday, and reaching the lead of 10-6 on Le Golf National Stadium.
History will show me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
We'll work hard tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not over until all the levels are on the tablet.
We have our objective, and it's trying to win this cup, we focus on it.
I've always said this, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're very conscious of our opponentes in the best golf team in the world."
Bojarn was thrilled to see how his players had successfully survived, and he added: “I am never going to get ahead of myself in this.
The day will be very different.
Tomorrow's the performance of the individuals that matters, and that's another thing.
It's great to play with partners when things are going well, but when you play one, all your talent is tested as a golfer.
It's the message that has to be sent to the players, getting the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Fury, will seek to be more successful in the games of individuals than with partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Fur dust has personally experienced both sides of this big transition on the last day, but it was successful with its team in Brookline, but it ended in losing when Europe performed “the miracle of Medinah. ”
“ I remember every goddamn word, ” he answered, asking how the president, Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, had encouraged his players to continue for the last day.
“ We have 12 important games to play tomorrow, but you want to start fast as you did in Brookline and Medinah.
As this momentum builds up, it exerts tremendous pressure on the games that are in the center.
We put our players in line, and we make them play like we feel will go best tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the defense and to play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
“ I chose these players in this order because I think they're gonna tire all the way through," Bern said about his choice of players in the individual race.
Germany’s New Warship Resurrected
The latest German Navy warship should have been built in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War Age, but it will not be ready until the first year of the next year because of broken systems and rising costs, according to local news reports.
Based on the “Roinland-Pfalz, ” the lead ship of the brand new military vessels of the Baden-Wettemberg Party, has now been postponed until the first half of the year 2019, according to the military spokesman who spoke to the Die Zeit magazine.
The ship was to be accepted by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the operation was handed over.
The four Baden-Wuertemberg ships ordered in 2007 should replace the Bremen Arms, which are now in their early years.
They should be equipped with more potent cannons, many anti-aircraft and ship-protector missiles and hiding technologies such as reduced transponders, and audio signals.
Other important qualities are longer use -- the latest ships should be used for up to two years away from their homeships.
However, constant delays mean that these modern warships -- which are said to enable Germany to demonstrate its scholarship to sea -- will be when finally out - of - date, says Die Zeit.
The F125 warship arrived in the news last year when the German army publicly refused to accept the water and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Snoop in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to its manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but the German media spoke of a number of serious “bads in software and hardware ” that made the warship useless if sent to war.
Software problems were of particular importance because the Baden-Wettemberg Armada will be controlled by 120 crews, which is twice as important as the Bremen Arms.
It was also found to be too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the ability of the Navy to improve it in the future.
The 7,000 - ton ship “Rheinland - Phillz ” is thought to be twice the size of a group similar to that used by Germany during World War II.
Apart from hardware defects, the costs of the entire project - including training of the crew - are beginning to cause problems.
It is said that it reached 3.1 billion euro (3.6 billion dollars), but it was originally expected to be 2.2 billion euro.
Problems afflicting the latest ships are particularly important in view of warnings that German superiority has diminished.
Earlier this year, Hans-Perter Bartel, head of the German Defense Committee, admitted that the Navy was actually becoming “an uprooted ship. ”
The deputy said that the problem was over time, for older ships were taken out of use but no ships replaced them.
He was sorry that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuertemberg party could be taken in use by the Navy.
National Trust Nature Protection Agency spying on the secret life of bats
A new study conducted in the Scottish Highlands has the goal of discovering how bats use the landscape when fishing for food.
The results are hoped to shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and to help guide future conservation measures.
The study, conducted by researchers at National Trust for Scotland, will monitor different species of bats in the Inverewe Gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be installed in key locations around the area to monitor leather behaviour over the period.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also have hand-to-hand surveillance tours.
Experts will analyse all recordings to reach the frequency of what the bats produce and what species do.
Maps of habitats and report will then be published to make a precise picture of their behavior on geographic scale.
Rob Dewar, a nature guardian for NTS, hopes that the results reveal the most important habitat for bats and how they are used of each kind.
These data will help to determine the benefits of agricultural management, e.g. by creating meadows and the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout Britain, bats have dropped dramatically.
They are at risk for construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their habitats.
Windmills and lights can also pose a risk, including flight paper and certain chemical treatments on construction materials, as well as home tax attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, when it comes to catching prey, their ears are much better than their eyes because they are accustomed to fishing at night.
They use advanced echomedia to locate insects and objects on their route of flight.
NTS, who are responsible for maintenance of 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization operates ten specialists who regularly conduct tests, nest checks, and sometimes rescue operations.
The Union has even set up Scotland’s first and only batland at the Treve Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten bat species of Scotland have their own home.
David Thompson, overseer of the ranch, says he is a perfect area for them.
“ The bed here at Threave is great for bats, ” he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of tall trees, and lots of good habitats.
But there are still many things we don't know about bats, so the work we work here and in other places will help us understand more fully what they need to thrive."
He emphasized the importance of checking bats before maintenance, since possible accidental destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 bats and young bats and destroy all bats in the area.
Bats are protected, and it is forbidden to kill them, harass them, or interfere, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish agent at Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about bats, and we don’t know how well many of their species are going."
Ronaldo renounces the charge of rape when lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristian Ronaldo has called charges against him about the rape of “good news ” and says that people want to“ pay attention ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The front of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's said that he paid her $35,000 later for silenting the incident, according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
A few hours after the charges were published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, in the Instagram Live video, said to his 142 million followers that they were “fun news. ”
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the World Champion five times a camera.
“ These people want to call attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player to smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations they have called “unacceptable reporting of privacy - related suspicions, ” according to Reuters’ news agency.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, Ronaldo would require improvement “in recent years as much as the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
The alleged incident has occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and the Las Vegas casino.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her in the rectum, according to the documents laid before the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the tragic incident and told her that he was “99 percent good man ” who fell into temptation because of“ 1 percent of the time. ”
The documents claim that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that they had both consents.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and had pictures of her injuries taken in a hospital, but she finally agreed to peace outside the courtroom because she was “fearful of revenge ” and was concerned about becoming“ publicly humiliated. ”
She says she now wants to cancel the reconciliation because she's still in shock after an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was near to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was due, and in summer he crossed over to Italian giant Juve with 100 million euro contracts.
Brett: Britain would “be sorry forever ” for losing car manufacturers
Britain would “be sorry forever ” if it lost its position as an international leader among the car manufacturers, says Secretary Greg Clark of Business.
He added that it was “anxiety ” that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily quit production in his factory in Buraston, near Derby.
“ We need a deal, ” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit did not have a contract, the effect of delays at the border would be that reality would cost jobs.
The Buraston factory, producing Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Unions.
“ I believe that if Britain falls out of the EU at the end of March we will see the manufacturing plants in our factory, ” said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota, Buraston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concern over EU exits without agreement on how international trade should take place, including Honda, BMW and Jagar Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close his Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that what car manufacturers say is a phase chain risk if Brexit without a contract becomes a reality.
Toyota's production line is based on "last minute", where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers both in Britain and the EU for automobiles manufactured by order.
If Britain declines the EU without a contract on March 29, interruptions at the border that the industry considers can lead to a loss of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's fighter in his factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and therefore production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers program Theresa May for the future relationship with the EU “is specifically aimed to prevent these views at the border."
“ We have to have a deal, and we want the best deal to make it possible to enjoy not only success in our modern world but as opportunities we can use it, ” he said on a radio show on the BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not just from Toyota, but from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue with a very effective approach.
Toyota could not tell how long their production would stop, but warned that for a long time the cost would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Buraston for 24 years and is a confidant of the union at the factory, said that his colleagues are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that once these jobs are done, they will never come back.
The government spokesman said: “We have provided an accurate and complete plan for our future relationship with the EU."
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House declared it on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy attorney Rod Rosenstein might be “replaced one week again, ” now the issue of Brett Kavanuthh’s committee of the Supreme Court will continue.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Muller, a special prosecutor who studies Russian initiatives in elections, connections between Trumps and Russia's assistants, and possible obstacles to the development of justice by the President.
For many weeks, the Washington legends of whether Trump will put an assistant attorney in harm’s way and thus jeopardize Muller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of recorded recording devices with Trump and the possibility of turning the president aside by using an additional 25th paragraph of the Constitution.
Rosenstein refused those claims.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, reporting that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday at the United Nations in New York City.
Trump said he didn't like to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he wouldn't be at the same time as the Senate judicial committee, where Kavanah and Dr. Christine Bresey Ford, one of the women who has charged him for sexual harassment, witnessed both.
On Friday, Trump’s weekly investigation of the FBI issued a further stand against Kavanaugh, who delayed the Senate votes.
Sarah Sander, Trump's press agent, was on the air on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked out at Rosenstein’s meeting, she said: “It has not yet been determined a date for him, it could be this week, and I think it may be possible for him to be delayed for another week because of all other things going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and it's always my pleasure to inform the press."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Participator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not for dissatisfaction about the fact that TV reporters had “softness, ” but she said:“ I don’t disagree with the fact that they have virtualism. ”
She then gave evidence that a direct relationship between Trumps and the media would increase.
“ The president answers more questions from the media than any president has ever done before, ” she said, without referring to a source, “We have reviewed these figures."
Sanders said, but “if the media has a chance to directly ask the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you've seen us do a lot of it in the last few weeks, and it'll replace press conferences when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with other leaders who visit him.
The press conferences with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown why in New York this week, when he displayed a lack of restraint and at times strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
A health minister writes EU health care staff in Scotland due to the anxiety of Brexite
The Minister of Health has written a staff from the EU that works within the NHS Scotland (NHS Scotland) to declare the appreciation of the nation and to wish it continued to work after Brexitt has passed through.
Jeane Freeman sent letters in less than six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already promised to be at the expense of license application for EU members who work within the public service sector.
In his letter, Miss Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between Britain and the EU have continued as a result of their resignation, and decision making is expected in the fall.
The British government has also worked on preparation if possible agreements.
I know this must be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to say again how much I appreciate the work of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
Community partners from the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit for the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home, and we want you to stay here very much."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after having had a head injury at a 31-27 loss against the Vanderbilt Commouses team on Saturday, according to a report from Mike Organ, journalist Tennessean.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury had just been halftime.
“ He came to the sideline and fell down there, ” said Reed.
Abercrombie was given oxygen on the sideline before he was put on a bar and worn out for a closer examination.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris, a radio man at WSMV, Nashville, Tennesse, that Abercrombie was in surgery at Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there was “no information on the type or severity of the injury yet ” and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, in her senior year at school, plays her first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five adults all Saturday before he left, who raised his total number of bitches to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp charges when buying property in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp fees when buying property in Britain.
The action will undo the success of Corbys campaigns to attract young voters
Increased plunger rates will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
A government fund estimates 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp fees when they buy property in Britain, and the excess money will be used to assist homeless people.
The operation will be considered an attempt to undo the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by promising accommodations at more manageable prices and taxing high incomers.
In Britain, individuals and companies who don’t pay taxes have to pay higher price, and the extra money will take the government’s operations to help homeless people.
The increase - this is in addition to current stamping, including the increase that was applied two years ago in an additional home and real estate pay for rent - may be up to three percent.
A government fund estimates that the rise will increase as much as 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s new buildings are bought by foreign sources, resulting in high prices and making it harder for those who want to buy property for the first time to get into the market.
Many wealthy areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become “darries ” because of a number of foreign merchants who spend most of their time abroad.
The new direction comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a drop in plunger charges to help more young people gain their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining real estate prices by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel their quotas in their manageable homes to fix Britain’s “houses. ”
Mr. Corbyn has reported a number of renovative improvements in housing, including rent control and the end of an rented house without cause.
He also wants to give the counsel more authority to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “In the past I said that I would devote myself to the restoration of the British dream during my first season -- that each new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our ruined real estate.
Britain's doors will always be open to those who want to live here, work, build their lives.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for foreign parties as it is for companies with foreign headquarters to buy homes as it is for hardworking British citizens.
For many, the dream of their own dwelling is far off: and the shame that followeth homelessness is still too real.
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland. ”
Jack Ross, a coach of Sunderland, says that becoming a coach of Scotland someday is his “most important goal. ”
The 42-year-old Scotsman now enjoys the challenge of starting a new life in the North-East Club, now sitting in third place in the first ward, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after he got St. Mirren back to the Scottish League in the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I injured my knee and so it was over," said Ross in an interview with an Sport sound at the BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there is always something that has pulled me back.
But that chance would only happen if I did well to train a platoon."
Forevers Ross as coaches of Sunderland include Dick Advocaate, David Moyes, Sam Allydece, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
A former trainer of the Allo Athelletic Club said that he felt no fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names at such a large club, which he had previously rejected coaching places at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ At present, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘ Can I get this club back to the big leagues? ’
This club certainly belongs in the elite unit because of its building and position," he said.
“ It's not easy to get him there, but I'd probably think of myself as a success here if I could get the club back up there."
Ross has only three years of experience as a trainer, after a period as an assistant trainer at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alla to recover from falling into the third division, changing St. Mirren, who was about to fall through a division, to the head of the League next season.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he ever was in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
“ It was probably a real breakthrough, ” he says about the season when he became a coach for Alloa.
“ I really believed that training was more suitable for me, even more than playing.
That sounds amazing, because I did fine, I had a decent income, and I enjoyed fitting success.
But adjustments can be difficult.
You have a lot to go through every week.
I still go through it with stress and pressure from my job, but training seems just right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do, I've never felt better about myself in all my adult life."

The best time for beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to polls.
This summer’s heat wave has proved to be profitable for British barbers struggling, but pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
Sales at pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, while sales at restaurants dropped 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the business adviser’s CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to that of the month of June, when bar sale increased by 2.8 percent, except for what restaurants sold even less.
Salan fell by 1.8 percent at the restaurants in June and got worse in July.
Pubs and barers, which aim mostly at a drinking sale, did the best they could to cope with as the restaurants went down.
Pubs who sold food also found it difficult to do the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
Sales of drinks at the pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent before the month; but the number of foods was reduced by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the analyst RRM, said: “These results are continuing in the swing that we have seen since April.
The weather and effects of important social events or sporting events are still the major factors when it comes to selling to markets outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still have difficulties, although the reduction in sales to 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful on continued costs of pressure.
This long and hot summer could hardly bring a worse time for restaurants, and only time will show whether changing temperatures, as we've had in August, will improve the situation."
The total growth in sales at pubs and restaurants, including newly opened sites, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the rate of opening.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the surveillance company with sales in the British puba and restaurant sector, gathers and separates data from 47 drivers, combined with an estimated 9 billion pounds, and is the industrial target for the sector.
One in five children has classified accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
One out of five children, down to 11 years of age, have classified accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the results of a survey.

The News Has Added Anxiety That Sex Is Revealed
Twenty percent of students claim to have a “almost ” account that they show to parents
One out of five children, down to 11 years of age, create secret accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a large increase in the “Insta ” account — a reference to the website Instagram.
The news has added concern that sexual material is published.
Twenty percent of the students said that they had a clean “almost ” account to show parents, as well as to have secret bills.
One mother who fell on her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website found a teenager who urged others to “enrage me. ”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC (HMC), showed that 40 percent of 11-18 - year - olds had two accounts and half admitted to have secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s a concern that so many youths are tempted to create an area on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a director without authority at the annual government meeting.
Doyle is the most successful liberalist of Scotland, and Ian Beatie, director of the Committee, said that the nomination would be an excellent opportunity for those who led to the sport to benefit from her great experience in the international field of the past decade.
“ Evaldh has great respect within the sports community in Scotland, Britain, and international, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money about it in the committee, ” said Beatie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hoping that I can contribute and help lead the sport ahead in Scotland."

Heart pump advertisements, which compare mothers with cows, cause online conflicts
A company producing breast pumps is now referred to on the Internet because of advertising that carries lactating mothers with milked cows.
The company Elvie published a puny advertisement to mark a presentation of what is said to be “the first silent bras of the world that can be worn on the outside. ” The advertisement is inspired by music videos and should be shown the freedom that the new pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and catch a song like: “Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail on me ” and“ If you did not notice, these are not the cubs but my breasts. ”
The pressure continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, pump, pump, I pump milk out of the udders."
However, the advertisement displayed on the company Facebook page has caused an online talk.
The video has 77,000 ratings and hundreds of comments and has had different reactions from viewers, many saying that it was missing with the “scroller ” that follows the milk industry.
“ Really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
As we do, they have to grow young and bear to produce milk, except what their calves are taken away from them just a few days after they are born," said one of the commentaries.

Another observer wrote: “It is understandable that it is difficult for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely off the beat of time. ”
Others came in defense of the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she was “very funny. ”
“ I think this is a big idea.
I would've bought one of these if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk.
The ad's a little crazy, but I took it the way it is.
It's a brilliant warning," wrote one of the audience.
Another said: “It’s a pleasant advertisement, which is directed to mothers who pump milk (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel as if they were “cursed. ”
It's not an advertisement to praise or judge the milk industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the women ’ group shows that they were all dancing with their breast pumps hidden in their bras.
The idea behind the ad campaign is that many women say they feel like cows when they pump milk out.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, has no wires or pipes, and fits in a bra, which allows women to move, hold their child, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner and supervisor at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a prominent presentation that would arouse publicity.
By comparing women to cows, we wanted to direct the light to the chest pump and all its challenges, even showing in a fun and familiar way the sense of freedom of the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie pump has ever been in the news.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two came across a fashion show for the designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in custody has increased suddenly, even though the number of people crossing the border every month has remained close to the same, and part of the reason is that hard speech and policy proposed by the Government of Trump has made it harder to get children into a temporary fetus.
In most cases, foster parents have been unwanted immigrants themselves, and they have feared risking their lives in the country by volunteering to give birth to a child.
The risk increased in June, when the government announced that the possibility of foster parents and other adults within the home would have to submit prints, and that the data would be shared by the INS.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of the INS, witnessed before the Senate and said that his institution had arrested a number of people who applied to nurse lonely children.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests were not registered.
“ Less than 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in homes that foster children are illegal, and much of them are illegal immigrants in criminal records.
“ That is why we keep looking for them, ” said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to deal more quickly with children, representatives announced new rules that require some children to appear in court within a month of being held in custody, rather than after 60 days of the previous reference, according to staff working in the shelters.
Many of them will come through a video conference, rather than in person, to give evidence for their legal position before a local judge.
The children who are doomed to enter the land are quickly shipped out of the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent tendencies or escape attempts, according to the personnel of the shelters and reports published by the system during the past few months.
Scholars said that these problems were even more likely to be in a larger institution, such as Tornillo, where it is likely that no one will notice that a child has problems because of the number of them.
They added that moving their children to the tent city without providing sufficient time to prepare them spiritually or say goodbye to a friend may add to the shock that many of them already face.
Syria says the United States, France, and Turkey are immediately withdrawn from the United States.
Walid al-Moualem, Minister of Foreign Affairs, also said in his speech at the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the country’s war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also acting as prime minister, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false assumption that they were fighting terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly. ”
“ They must withdraw immediately, without any condition, ” he said to the council.
Moualem firmly claimed that “the war against terrorism was almost over ” in Syria, where over 350,000 have died since 2011, and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred struggle until we clean up all Syriac areas“ from both terrorist groups and from “all foreign sources. ”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, with most of them training and recommending both Cuban troops and Syriac Arabs fighting the President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the situation was good enough for them to return, and he taught “some Western countries ” to“ spread unsatisfactory fears ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“ We have called on an international society and an humanitarian organization to make it easier for them to come back, ” he said.
“ They make politics out of something that should be purely humane. ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not give any money to rebuild Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the Resistance to end the war.
The U.S. ambassadors say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral area at the last major resistance stronghold has created an opportunity to continue political conversation.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a severe attack by Syrian troops strengthened by the Russians into the region where three million people live.
Moualem, on the other hand, stressed that the treaty had “a critical deadline, ” describing the hope that military action would be directed toward Yishdis, including Nasra Front fighters, who have ties with Al-Qaeda, and that it“ puts out. ”
The letter de Mistura, ambassador of the UN, hopes to bring the first find with a new committee composed of members of the government and resistance, to write a constitution for Syria after the war and pay the way to vote.
Moualem proposed conditions for participation in the Syrian government of the Committee, saying that its work was to be limited to “go over the regulations of the present government, ” warning against all interventions.
Reasons Trump will win another election period
According to that argument, Mr. Trump would win the reunion in 2020, unless the charges and scandals put an end to his presidential career, as many liberal viewers would likely hope to.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dreamiest end ever to presidential life!"
At present, the audience does not have any signs of weariness.
Since 2014, ratings have doubled to 1.05 million in CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million viewers at the best time, which is an increase of 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and a part of the MSNBC, “The Rachel Maddow Show, ” has reached peaks with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news evenings.
“ This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don’t understand, ” said Neal Baer, a member of the ABC drama program "Designed Survivor" about an employee inside the government who will be president after the councilhouse is completely destroyed.
Nell Scovel, experienced comedian and writer of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys, ” has another hypothesis.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The cab driver told her he was gonna vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
“ He said, ‘ Because he makes me laugh, ’ said Miss Scovello to me.
There's a value of entertainment in the mess.
However, unlike TV shows, Washington stories could determine Roe v. Wade's fate, whether families of immigrants can be united and healthy to the international economy.
Only the audience who enjoy what is most privileged can afford to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than being an informed citizen when you look at a sixth - time group of experts reasoning on Bob Woodward’s “very close ” sources for his book“ Fear, ” or a $15,000 jacket of ostriches that Paul Manoft wore (“a body born with presumptuousness," said the Washington Post), and the consequences of the precise biological descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump.
I will at least never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“ A lot of what he does and makes a person feel like a reality show, is that he gives you something every night, ” said Britisht Montgomery, director of the Wellhouse Enterprises and author of the show "Pawn Stars" when he spoke about employees in Trump's show and daily changes in the narratives (e.g., starting a fight with N.F.L. and praising Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one act, or you'll lose it.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss, there was a temperature of 26 degrees and sunshine outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, who remained indoors watching the MSNB while he picked up CNN.
He could not tear himself away, not when Brett Kavanagh was to witness before the Senate Court of Justice, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“ I remember when we were making all these crazy features back in the day, and people said, ‘ This is the beginning of Western civilization, ’ said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“ I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out people were right. ”

Money Outside the Highest Controversy of the Middle Ages
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th ideal area sees the money flowing, thanks to the rest of the budget, which led to two delegates competing for the same seat.
The newly organized Pittsburg area sends forth the democrat Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another ideal area of special elections last summer.
Lamb volunteers to meet another Republican Keith Rothfus, representing the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th Precinct.
The national maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old election areas were organized in the interests of Republicans and that it violated the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th election area has been set up to compete for campaigning between the main financiers of both classes, the Democrat Committee (DCCC) and the Nobel Committee of Republicans (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th election area in Pennsylvania, but many were watching the elections.
The Republicans had once spent more than a decade in that seat, and President Donald Trump was defeated in the election area with a 20 - point difference.
Political experts have given Democrats a little advantage.
In the United States, consider punishing El Salvador because of China's support, but then cancel.
Kingdom ambassadors noticed that Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Peking, with little protests from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, the president of Panama in June 2017, staying at a Panama hotel until partners drove the Trump Industries out.
The officials of the State Department decided to call back the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama because of “a new decision to accept Taiwan no longer," said Heather Nauter, the Ministry’s spokesman in a statement early this month.
However, punishment was considered solely against El Salvador, estimated to have received 140 million dollars from the United States for relief work in 2017, including for drug surveillance, development and economic support.
The punishments that were proposed and included loss of financial support and the limitations of the publication of residence clearance would have been painful for the Central Americas, where unemployment and murder rates are high.
As internal workers continued, U.S. and Central American representatives delayed a conference on security and economic success and were to follow a similar meeting that was held last year and believed to be a step forward in action to prevent people from moving to the United States.
However, in mid - September, representatives from the top row made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending all speculations about punishment against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now to address the conference, which is to be held in the middle of October, as a symbol of its importance in the eyes of the government, the ambassadors said.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss further the discussion described by the three American delegates, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the interior reasonings against the privilege of being anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the government and also spoke about the matter against anonymousness.
Learn History
The next scandal could be Robert Mueller's report, a special prosecutor, on the possible action of Mr. Trump to prevent justice, but there are many official evidences.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller will also reverse his investigation whether Mr. Trump's campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If the council is to be ruled by another category, Trump may have to be responsible for it, at the time he prepares to see his voters again, and perhaps the jury of his appointed peers.
But it's very uncertain, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall is flat, nor is it the fall of his coal in Europe.
We all have to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take Hitler’s power, only if Western countries had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed to do so and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of distress that followed.
History revolves around such important points, and it delays or delays the irrefutable march of democracy.
The United States faces some of these important points now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump drives Governor Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Muller's fate?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had suggested secret recordings of the president and had discussed whether he was not qualified for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
“ How will we react if the newly asked FBI investigation of Brett Kavanagh is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court despite likely charges of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we choose a council in the middle period that will allow Mr. Trump to assume responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have to last a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz of the same Nazi government and was formerly assigned to my city of ambassadors.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, how can I help but maintain a positive view of our future?"

Graham Dorran, Ranger team man, optimism for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrias will put them in a strong position to get up from the G-group of Europe. Rangers made a spectacular draw in Spain against Villreal earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented the centrer Graham Dorran from playing his first game in the season until the game against Villareal, which ended with a 2-2 tie, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a jumper for better success.
“ It was good to get this level for us, because Virrreal is a strong point, ” said the Dorran, 31 years old.
“ We began to believe that we could achieve something and ended up taking one step.
Perhaps we could have squeezed out a victory at the end, but in general, a reasonable outcome was likely drawn.
They were probably better at the first half, and we got strong into the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European League.
I hope we can make three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they did well in their last game, but with the audience who's supporting us, I'm sure we're gonna make it, and we're gonna have a positive outcome.
The last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that occurred at the club itself, but now there is a good feeling.
The team's good, the boys are enjoying themselves, the training's good.
"I hope we can go further now, put the last season behind us, and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing their pension saving
Although participants in the poll had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said that they talked to their mates about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said that they would discuss this with their children.
“ People want a family member to take care of it, but it doesn’t take the right steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Social Security Department.
That's the way to start.
Talk to your mate and your children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not give them good warnings.
Talk with your counselors and your family about where and when you are treated, since these options can change a lot in terms of expenses.
In this case, ask your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance through a long-term designer, mixed life insurance that pays in cash, to help pay expenses, or self- insurance with your own money--as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Avoid legal differences in advance.
Get a health care provider so that you can specify someone you can trust to take care of your healthcare provider and ensure that your wishes are met by health care professionals if you cannot tell them straight out yourself.
Consider, too, your financial finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your aged father or mother is in an emergency and is going to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please fill in this information carefully in your written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It’s not just about money, it's about who the doctors are, ” said Martin.
“ What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you have that plan ready."

Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
At least 384 were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, said representatives, and the number of the dead is expected to rise.
Since all communications are down, relief workers have not been able to provide any information from the Dongla County, a region north of Palu, located near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left leaving their homes in Pala after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Dongglah, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu, the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, is located on the central coast of Sulawesi, a population estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and the tsunami struck.
Dongglala is a county that covers over 380 miles [380 km] of coastline in the northwest island of Sulawesi.
The management area under the province had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the Central Sulawes region, especially in the Dongal coastal region.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but most of them are in Morowali, which is on the beach in the face of Solwesi.
In the last century, the effects of tsunamis on Pala and Dongla, according to Indonesia’s disaster organization, have been several times during the past century.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a tsunami hit and hundreds of Dongga houses were destroyed.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Dongga in 1996, where nine died.
Indonesia sits on the active fire cycle of the Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A big earthquake on the west coast of Aceh County in the north of Sumatra River of December 26, starting a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coastline of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes crossed the western coast of Sumatra late March and early April.
Hundreds die on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 at Richter’s capital stage hit Jöu, Indonesia’s largest island, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 at Richter’s, near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra region.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake on 7.5 at Richter rode over one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, raising up as much as 10 feet [10 m] of tsunamis that destroyed many villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: The Pidie Jaya County in Aceh was the foundation of an earthquake that caused destruction and panic when people recalled the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
No tsunami was formed this time, but more than 100 died as a building collapsed.
2018: Great quakes ride over Lombok’s tourist island in Indonesia, and more than 500 people died, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, aged 29 years and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, for trying to prevent reports of domestic violence and stress arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, Palin took the phone from her friend when she tried to call the police to report an alleged crime.
Palin is held at the Mat-Su Station where he is awaiting court hearing, and he is held against $500 insurance, according to a report from KTUU.
On Saturday, when asked to declare guilt or innocence on the news station, he faced a judgment hearing, stating that he was “not guilty. ”
Palin is charged with three crimes of Group A, which means he could be sentenced to prison for up to one year and had to pay a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with crime in Group B, which has been punished for one day in prison and a $250 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is now being treated for the Alaska Service Centre.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing the announcement of domestic violence, and of carrying weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of surrenderers after she suffered a traumatic stress disorder about his son’s violent behavior after his military service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake on Richter triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems are down and the number of deaths are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred right near the middle of Sullawsi Island, located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident took place on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in Pala when the tsunami hit the beach.
The prosecutors seek rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
In New York City, prosecutors want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of participating in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, and this is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violation of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is believed to have rented a Home Depot truck to attack people on the bicycle path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, where he drove down a walking and riding roadfarers in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “striking ” and causing serious physical injuries“ wishful, ” according to the Declaration of Domination, which was registered in the southern state of New York.
Both of these prosecutions can lead to possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Many weeks after the attack, the 22 - point federal court of Saipov charged with 22 counts, including eight counts of criminal murder, usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized criminal organizations, including Saipov charged with violent crime and for destroying automobiles.
The attack included “a relatively intended scheme, ” said accusers and described Sapiov’s act as“ terrible, cruel, and immoral. ”
“ Asyfullo Habibullaevic Saipov became the cause of physical injury, damage and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, ” says the Declaration.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
In the United States of New York, it was a decade since the last capital punishment took place.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a court of justice in New York City in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of practicing spies for the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal record.
He told an investigator that he was comfortable with what he had done, said a police officer.
Saipov told the authorities that he had the idea of an attack after looking at an IIS video tape on his phone, as stated in the charge.
He also asked to show an IIS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 counts of the charge.
David Patton, one of the public defenders Saipov, said that they were “consciously disappointed ” with the prosecution’s decision.
“ We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accept the guilt declaration against life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only extend the shock due to this event for the whole subject," said Patton.
The defenses of Saipov's had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the penalty of death.
A member of the League says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead negotiations for Brexet.
Nigel Farge promised that today he would “encourage the army of the people ” to protest at a conference of conservatives.
This former leader Ukip said that politicians must “taste pressure ” from skeptics about the EU at the same time as one of Theresa May's members suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
At the Birmingham protester Peter Bone said that Britain would be “went out ” now if Mr. Farage was the leader for Brexit.
However, the challenge May faces to settle deep differences between her own team was even more apparent when conservatives who want to remain in the EU participated in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is having difficulty keeping Chequer's plan in the right direction and is subject to criticism from those who are in favor of Brexite, those who oppose, and the EU.
The Allies claimed that she will continue to fight to negotiate with Brussels despite opposition and forcing those opposed to Brexitet and the Labour Party to choose between her plans and her “rage. ”
Mr. Bone said to the Leave Means League protester in Solihall that he wanted to “get rid of the Chequer's plan. ”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been allowed to participate and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“ If he were in charge, we would have gone out now, ” he said.
The Witness from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequer's plan."
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own songs in our own country."
Mr. Bone referred to indications that the public opinion had changed from the election in 2016: “The idea that the British public has changed their mind and wants to stay is completely false. ”
Andrea Jends, a conservative supporter of Brexit, also said to reporters: “I just want to say, ‘ Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequer's plan is unpopular in public, and opposition will not vote for it, and it will be unfriendly among our party crews and in the operations that are on the streets and choose us.
Please, call off the Chequer plan and start listening."
In direct message to May, she added: “Parent ministers keep the job when they keep their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said that the politicians must be “tempered ” if they were to succumb to the decision that was taken after the vote in 2016.
“ It is now about trust between us and our political party, ” he said.
“ They want to try to cheat Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you get away with this."
He added in his message to the crowds: “I want you to put pressure on your political party, who is about to cheat on Brexit.
We support the public forces in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become independent, self-controling, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters held protesting in Birmingham, which ended with a two - hour protest meeting in the center of the city.
A small group of unionists waved their flags against Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis, of the Labour Party, made fun of conservatives because of security problems that appeared in the class’s phone program when the conference was opened.
“ These are the people who tell us that they can have every computer system in order and all technology for Canada plutonium, without barriers, for free business with Ireland without borders, ” he added.
“ It’s a total scandal.
There's no such thing as good Brexite," he said.
Warren is going to “consider seriously ” to volunteer for the presidency.
U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the election in November, he is “consuming a serious campaign for the presidency. ”
A report from Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat discussed his future at a civil meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has recently criticized President Donald Trump of the United States, volunteers to requite in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was a member of Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been the center of speculation that it could volunteer against Trump in 2020.
The meeting at Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th meeting in the form of a community meeting with its voted citizens, from Trump’s office.
One of those present at the meeting asked her if she was planning to volunteer for president.
Warren replied that it would be time for “women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then a woman will also need a leader. ”

Baton Roge Police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old at a press conference at 11 o'clock in the morning.
She had previously published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man that saw on the tape.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near Southern University University University's university campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got shot in the head and died as a result," said Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, with the press on Saturday, according to a 24-7sport report.

In Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat as ordered by their team.
It was evident from the fact that the Valtterti Bottas reached a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday before launch, that Mercedes's team orders would play a major part in the race.
Botts had a good start on startup and almost left Hamilton standing in the first two corners and invited Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel went first into the pit and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but he should have been able to decide the outcome.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, while Hamilton survived a bit of a conflict where a driver of Ferrari was forced to leave his inner side after he had been in danger of staying behind, after defense attempts in the third corner.
At the end of the first lap, Max Worstappen started from the back of the group on his 21th birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he delayed changing tires to try to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonn and reach fourth place.
He finally entered the pit into the 44th circle but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight rings, and Raikonen took his fourth place.
This is a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman letting me get out of the way.
The team has accomplished a great job to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump, U.S. president of the United States, made fun of senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting Saturday because of her claims that she did not leak the letter from Christine Bresey Ford, with the accusation of Brett Kavanagh, the highest court judge, on sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but he did not directly comment on the Ford for the Senate decision committee, and instead he said that what was going on at the Senate Assembly showed that people were “hopeful and cruel and untrue. ”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on during the last days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and cruel, and untrue, ” he said.
“ When you see the signals and leaks, you say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak that?
Do you recall her reply... You leaked the document -- “O, ha, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Wait a minute.
No, we don't lie there," he said and imitated the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the charge of Ford against Kavanaugh was raised, and therefore it was leaked early in September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
“ I didn’t hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I didn’t write her story, ” said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill story.
“ She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did as she asked me to. ”
But her denial did not seem to go well into the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “Let me tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't leak anything, but this was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense for Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, suggesting that a Democrats are taking advantage of the charges.
“ They are determined to regain their power, no matter what methods have to be used.
You see the cruelty, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to roll over to gain power and control," said the president, according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League Division: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two targets for Giants versus Dundee
The Dundee Stars improved their losses on Friday at the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, by winning the next game, 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-yard head start after the line from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beaullier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were in the home, but Dwyer got the Giants back over.
Francois Bouchard’s standard for Dundee, and two bounds from Lukas Lundendir Nielsen, then ensured their victory.
This was the third loss game during the season for Adam Keese, Elite League, who had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.

An airplane driver loses his life to make sure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape from an earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died making sure that an airplane with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed, and many are missed after a big earthquake hit the island of Solwesi on Friday and then started a tsunami.
Large aftershocks continue to plague the area, and many are trapped in the city of Pala.
The 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, even though his fellow workers had fled the control tower that was raging violently at the Mutira Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake struck, could surely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He died in a hospital later.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to a report from ABC News, Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpan, Kalimantan, to take it to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palau.
“ We are very sad to hear this, ” he added.
Authorities fear that the number of the dead could exceed a thousand when the U.S. disaster agency says that access is restricted to the town of Dongla, Sigi, and Boutong.
“ It is estimated that the number of deaths are still rising because there are many bodies still in ruins and cannot be reached, ” said Sutopo Purw Nugroho, chairman of the Agency.
As many as six feet [6 m] high, Pala has been devastated by mass funerals on Sunday.
The military and passengers are working to bring supplies and supplies.
A giant Kuusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There's little clean water.
The ministries have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross strives to find survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, president of Indonesia, came to Pala on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete any mission related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said a story from CNN.
Earlier this year, earthquakes attacked Lombok, Indonesia, where more than 550 people died.
An airplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niglin now reports that the same thing is missed after a plane crashed into a lagoon.
The airline, whose plane crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one person is missed, after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew had survived the sinking plane.
Air Niugini announced that from afternoon onward, it did not know the outcome of one male passenger.
The airline said that they work with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators in an effort to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
A boat in the area helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
The delegates said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of all of them was stable.
The cause and exact order of the incidents are still unclear.
The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the aircraft was very low.
“ It was really good, ” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others could walk down the side of the deep water and find an emergency exit in the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots were afraid and shouting and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that fishermen who were at work near the end of a dock also helped with the rescue by using a well - oiled boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in some 30 feet [30 m] of water.
Data from the Air Security Agency show that 111 people have been killed in the PNG-registered aircraft accidents over the past two decades, none of which had anything to do with Air Niglin.
One expert describes the timeline of the evening when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutors completed their case on Saturday in a review case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, U.S. Department of Justice, was in court for hours as an expert on information.
He described the jury as using cell - phone records to pool the defendant’s trips, 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had received a location data from several cell phones showing that Telisis was with the Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his earlier statements, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time that he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
On Saturday, Sanford witnessed and said that he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville."
Another imbalance was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Telalis had erased text messages, phone calls, and her contact information from their phone.
“ He destroyed her from his life, ” said Hale.
It is estimated that defenders will give their final talk on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the matter to be passed on later that day.
The High Breed: what is a conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trike wants to fight against negative opinions about the music model by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hops were distant from their origin where it contained political messages and discussed community matters.
They want to search the source again and make a conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently seen changes in Britain through artists like Akka and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Mother in New York City legalized couple for disfellowshipping after "mighty" text messages
A nurse in New York City legalized a couple for an illegal disfellowshipping after she accidentally received text messages from the mother because she complained that she was “a different black person. ”
The couple refuse to be prejudiced and likens the lawsuit to “ocraft. ”
Lynsey Planco-Flaxman, a mother of two, declared dissatisfaction when she found out that her new fetus, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first arrived at work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering their failures, the "smart" of Plasco-Flaxman, Ms. Maurice, said that their former fetus, who was black, had failed, and that she would have expected to get a Filipsey woman, according to a New York Post report.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice now sues the couple and wants compensation for the disfellowshipping, worth $350 a day for the six - month job she had originally been hired, even though no contract was signed.
“ I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do this, ” she said in an interview with the Post on Friday, adding: “I know this is discrimination. ”
The couple have objected to the charge that they were prejudiced and say that the right thing to do was to fire Maurice, because they felt that they could not trust her after taking offense.
“ My wife sent her a message she wasn’t going to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We're not prejudiced people," said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“ But even if it was surprising, who would trust their children with someone after acting rudely toward them?
The newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “occupy, ” saying that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this condition?
That's not very nice," said Plasco, who works in the investment industry.
The matter is still in judgment, but the common people have spoken against the couple in the community, and have reproved them for their ways and their reasonings.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, says in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
“ It is very funny now that we know of the tremendous success of Paddington. ”
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write a children’s book on a little toy bear, took rejection of his work with a calming positive attitude, and added that the 60th anniversary edition of the book was “outraged ” after his death last year.
As for Paddington, described as “a very important family member, ” she added that her father had shown a quiet pride in his final success.
“ He was a very quiet man, and not accustomed to showing off, ” she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who accomplishes something.
I think that's exactly how he viewed the success of Paddington.
Though Paddington was creation, and his imagination, he always gave thanks to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 of the Hospital in Nice, where doctors did all they could to save her life, but in vain.
“ Nod regularly called me and told me that the situation was very bad, that she wasn’t expected to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then Nad called me and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that I would have to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart rate alive were slowly losing its activity and being eliminated from her body.
She had died recently, and this was her body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I could not sleep or cry, for I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her dead daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the trouble she suffered.
“ No one knew anything, ” she said.
“ I bowed down my head, and tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang messages to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have set up messages on a Wales bridge with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, a son of Ms. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and suicide when he was 18.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel as I have to feel every day, ” she said.
Miss Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney and said that her son had been a successful cook with a contagious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could shine up any room."
He stopped working before he died, for “he was taken down into a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, at the age of 11, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Miss Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that it will be the aftereffects."
Miss Davis created the message “to let people know that you can go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don't sit there and say nothing--you need to talk to someone."
Miss Humphrey, who has been friends with Miss Davies for years, lost his mate, Mark, to 15 years of age, shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t talk about how he felt or was depressed or anything like that, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at the worst of his Christmas day, when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a shock to them, but they had to work out: “It’s a hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we must endure and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on a thread when the FBI has his investigation.
“ I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a study with a limited time and scope -- maybe we could get a little bit of peace, ” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was ‘ breaking apart ’ in the middle of a conflict between groups where everything was in reverse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their tabloidness is due to the timing.
The mid - season election is only five weeks, on November 6, and if the Republicans are doing badly, as expected, their serious efforts to get their man elected to serve in the Supreme Court of the United States will be weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met Ashley, his wife through him, but she was a personal secretary for Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes his investigation?
There will be a vote at the Senate Assembly, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit right now.
It is not yet certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, but it would allow the Vice President Mike Pence to break up the tie and confirm it in the office of the Supreme Court.
Number of escapes of North Korea under Kim's control
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korea congressman.
Park Byeong-seag, quoted data from South Korea’s Union Council and said that 1127 people had fled last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that a more strict border check between North Korea and China and the higher costs of smugglers with people being key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those who escape North Korea are invited to a South Korean national rights.
Seoul says that over 30,000 North Korea residents crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most people flee to China, which has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross over than the well - concerned objective area between North and South Korea.
China sees refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Communication between North and South Korea, still in war, technically speaking, has improved substantially within the past few months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for a debate that focused mainly on delayed negotiations on nuclear weapons.
This was after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump of the United States and Kim Jongun in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in a rough way toward the nuclear-free Korean.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong Ho, foreign minister of North Korea, blamed U.S. clients for the lack of progress since then.
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty of our country’s safety, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons first, ” stated R in his speech at the U.S. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “motherly diseased ” and says he is incapacitated to perform the work of the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority, called Brett Kavanagh, the Supreme Court of the “motherly Disease, ” and said he was too quick to serve in the Supreme Court.
Upon Saturday, at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas, Palosi said those words.
“ I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called hysterical, ” said Pelosi about her reaction to the testimony of Kavanaugh to the Senate Board on Thursday.
Kavanagh denied strong accusations that he had harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he began to cry out with a lump in his neck when he discussed his family and his school years.
He also publicly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the charges on him “a disgusting and organized reputation, ” which was organized by liberal men who were angry at Hillary Clinton’s loss of the presidential election in 2016.
Golosi said that the testimony of Kavanaugh proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was biased toward the Democrats.
“ I think these statements and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is incapacitated for the job, ” she said.
When she was asked if she would try to get Kavanagh expelled if confirmed and if Democrats reached the majority of the council, she would not respond.
“ I'll say this, if he's not telling the council or the FBI the truth, he's not only unauthorized to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now, ” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now acting as judge at the appeal court in Washington D.C.
Pelosli added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions made by Kavanaugh against the health laws of Affordable Care Act or the abortion laws of Roe v. Wade, since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh turned to questions as to whether he would surround certain Supreme Court decisions.
“ This is no time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say, ‘ Great is the wonderful thing. ’
And women need to take advantage of this.
This is a just saying, a month and a year of wrath coming up, and it doesn't come out without crying.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
“ I don't think it's uncommon, do you? ”
She continued, “I received a lot of help from a woman who was the manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had developed technology, so when she got angry and started crying, she said to her interviewer, ‘ You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to express some anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories from my previous job in an office with men in the majority, where I started crying out of a rage I couldn't express, came an older woman and took me in the back of my neck, and she was a cold officer whom I had always feared a little, and she dragged me into a ladder.
“ Never let them see you cry, ” she said to me.
They don't know you're furious.
They think that you are sad, and are glad that you have obtained your place."
Patricia Schroeder had served with Gary Hart when he was serving as president, then a representative of the Democratic Republic of Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in the grip of adultery on a boat named Money Business (Apaness) and withdrew, Miss Schroeder felt that there was no reason for her not to consider presenting herself to president.
“ It wasn’t a very well - thought - out decision, ” she said laughing to me, 30 years later.
“ It was already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone named it “The White White and the Seven Dwarf. ”
With a long time gone for the campaign, she was behind what was involved in the fund, so she promised not to volunteer unless she was able to collect $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
“ Do they think I can get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not formally offer herself, she was so superior to the emotions -- thanks to the people who had supported her, resentment to the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and focus her eyes on the voters instead of representatives, and anger into the gender discrimination -- that she burst into tears.
“ You'd think I'd had a nervous breakdown, ” said Miss Schroeder as she recalls how the media responded.
“ You might think Clerex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
The reasons why a business war between the United States and China might be good for Beijing
The first shots in the commercial war between the United States and China were rickety, and even though the war is far behind, the national gap could be a advantage for Peking in the long run, say experts.
President Donald Trump of the United States shot the first warning shot earlier this year by bringing taxes on the main exports of China, including solar cells, steel, and aluminum.
This week, the largest escalation came with new customs covering the value of $200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), and taxing as much as half of all good products that are imported into the United States from China.
Peking has responded in the same way each time and recently placed 5 to 10 percent of customs on U.S. products at $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. taxation, and it is unlikely that one of the world’s largest economic systems will be released.
To get Washington to hobble, you have to give in to demands, but it would be far too humiliating for the China president Xi Jinping to bend out publicly from under the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Peking holds the cards right, pressure from the business war in the United States could have a positive effect on China for the long run, reducing the mutual need of both economys for each other.
“ The fact that rapid political decision either in Washington or Peking could lead to conditions that lead to economic collapse in either country, is in fact much more dangerous than the audience has previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria “prepared ” for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the land and seek help to rebuild the land, now in bad condition after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, secretary of state, spoke at the UN General Assembly and said that conditions in the country would improve.
“ Today, ” he said, “the situation on earth is more stable and secure, thanks to the success of the battle against terrorism.
The government continues to arrive at normal circumstances by building areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
All is now ready for refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave because of the terrorism and the one - side economic decisions that dealt with their daily lives and employment.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million still living in the country needs help.
Al-Moualem said that Syriac authorities would be pleased to accept assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept assistance under conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe’s team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by conquering the United States team with a final result of 16.5 at 10.5 points on Le Golf National Stadium outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the throne when the troops, led by the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickson, who was having difficulty most of the race, struck his initial blow into the water in a 16th hole, which is a pair of 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molina.
The Italian golfer Molina shone brightly in all of his games and became 1 of 4 players for the results 5-0-0, from the beginning of its current format in 1979.
U.S. man Jordan Spieth lost 53/4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was at the bottom in the order of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the world's best golfer, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who possibly played in his last race for the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times on the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European champion with a 25.5 record level.
“ I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get that trophy back.
It's about the past, and it was a pleasure to be able to help," said emotional Garcia after the triumph of Europe.
He handed his countrymen John Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 23/41 on Sunday.
“ I was incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said the 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now registered with 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 great titles and has only second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had trouble finding themselves on the field, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finaa, who played a good game through the whole race.
The captain of the United States, Jim Furky, said after disappointment with his team’s performance, “I am proud of them, they fought.
It was sometime in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'm putting Thomas on top.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with PGA in the United States, and I'll name Ryder of the Cup, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You gotta take off your hat.
They played better than we did."
