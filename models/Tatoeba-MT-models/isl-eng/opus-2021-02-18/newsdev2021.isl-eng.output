Biden leads polls in three key countries
In just 100 days of election, Joe Biden, a candidate of Democrat, enjoys a head start in three important cycles.
CNN reports today that Biden was in Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden is measured by 51% and 46%, respectively.
In Arizona, the score is 49 % ~45 % Biden in favor and Michigan is heading for the highest level of Biden, where it leads at 12 points, 52 %–40%.
To win the election in November, after 100 days, Trump has to turn all these states around, and actually more.
Trump, who lives these days, is plagued by a crown virus epidemic that is increasingly blamed by the people, saying that the vast majority of people in the country have responded poorly, or very badly, at the beginning of the pandemic.
In addition, Trump has been misinformed by protests and riots raised by George Floyd’s death.
Trump and his government have been mismanaged or wrong about these matters.
To give a crown of Trump's problem, he is now subject to more serious criticism for ordering the FBI to break up protests in cities where city or governors are Democrats.
Has it produced an enormous pile of wolf among its citizens, and this anger spread to other Americans.
Also, photos of FBI agents pulling Protestants into unmarked cars have not helped the United States cause.
Did the advertisement of The Lincoln Project pay attention just to this, but it can be seen from below.
Trump conquered all three kingdoms in 2016, but with very little votes.
In fact, Trump won a very large number of states with little votes and won the election with a minority vote.
Michigan, for example, conquered him with only 10,704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Almost all polls that political commentators say are significant are to show the same conclusions, Biden is passed out.
A new study by CNN, Arizona, shows that the lead of Biden has now passed the margin of the survey.
So do CNN and Quinpiac University studies on Florida.
In fact, Fox News, who leaned to the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published studies of the same substance in its mediums.
The president’s last hope, based on the results of the questions, is that Trump might hope to return to an important location within the world if attention to the campaign is focused on the economy.
U.S. economy was severed after the Covid-19 pandemic, but voters do not seem to be linking the economic crisis with the crown virus epidemic.
It is to say, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for having responded badly to the crown virus epidemic, but they are more confident that he will deal with the economic crisis that now strikes on the State.
Trump, however, has failed to control the debate in the campaign.
As a result of the riots that have been burning almost continuously since the news of the video was released with four police officers killing George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the discussion over to law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order became his identifying words.
It seems to have failed altogether, as once said.
As the polls lean more on Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to leave Trump behind and give support to either Biden, or to someone else, who is then Biden without even mentioning him by name.
This is what they do because of the arrangement in the United States to vote in many elections at the same rate.
Thus, the voter can simply mark the second category of the voter’s section, making it a matter of votes for all other candidates of the vote.
Thus, candidates of the Republican Party try to separate themselves from Trump's low gang and to achieve their own results in the election.
The Olympics of Youth in Dakkar are suspended until 2026.
The Olympics of youth were to be held next year at Dakar, which has been postponed until 2026 because of the Korean epidemic after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal agreed to do so.
However, the delay of the first Olympic Games to be conducted in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
Volunteer arrested for the fire at Nantes
A volunteer at the Cathedral of Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with a fire destroyed by the church.
Le Monde quotes the prosecutor as saying that the suspect, a Rwandan fugitive who served as an overseer in the church, admitted to having set the fire on fire.
The man’s lawyer says in a conversation with another crowd that the man was greatly sorry for his actions.
Among the things that were destroyed in the fire were organel of the 17th century, and historically illustrated windows of the church.
The 39 - year - old volunteers whose name has not been mentioned were arrested shortly after the fire of the last July 18th, but he was released.
He was reassigned last night and then entered the custody post.
"No way out of this"
I am warmly welcomed in Baltasar’s home and Christian Samper, Copavogi.
The purpose of my visit is Baltasar's new art show and his daughter, Mireya, which will be opened on August 1 in the Little Kombi in Snæfells.
Is this the first time my father shows up?
I am led down to Baltasar’s workshop, where a magnificent painting appeared.
Large, gloomy pictures of old women but also of flying creatures; eagles on one; shadows on another.
From the workshop, the home is properly covered.
“ We had a horse here with us that bit the grass, ” says Baltasar.
“ The horse works much better than a mower on this hill and the hills we have. ”
Mireya is with me and Kristja and Baltasar, and she tells us how her work rhymes with what is here.
“ Implantation, a combination of paperworks and ornamental fabrics.
They're all very white and it's like, "What my dad's doing, 'cause I'm working with the light and stuff," she says.
“ It’s been a year since that idea.
There were certain things I was working on and wanted to show there, but they got stuck in Tokyo because of Covid.
When my dad started painting and I saw where he was going, I rethinked my part," says Mireya, but Baltasar's work has a strong appeal in Icelandic legends about misogynistics.
“ When I saw that my dad was making these paintings with my wives, I felt that I had the right to make jewelry that relates to them, ” says Mirera, whose jewelry she works with Victory, Inga Bjarnason, a gold ticket for Sign.
“ This is what I am making out of my jewelry. ”
Last year, Mireya attended 72 artists Aademia perceptions at Snæfellsnes, including the Little Cambodia complex and found the building fascinating.
“ It’s a new space, an old pile that has just built up, ” says Mireya, who spoke there with Baldvinu Sverisdott, an artist who suggested that Mirea and Baltasar put together a show.
“ She wanted us both to show, and then we thought:
“ Why not?
This is a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain, and he attended the Barcelona School of Arts before he was held in the world to study art museums and research.
He stopped here in Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by land and nation.
He returned here shortly thereafter, met his Christian wife, and has lived here continuously since 1963 for 57 years.
Baltasar, an outstanding artist, has held dozens of private shows, and a show of Christ’s Evening Meal in many places.
It is best known for its large murals, including wall decorations in the Flatrean Church and French in a Fundamentalist Church.
“ What affects what I do is the bite Iceland has and no other place, ” says Baltasar.
“ This low sun and these shadows that stretch and stretch.
As soon as I got here, I thought, "Wow, here's work."
Mireya is the eldest child of Kristuna and Baltasar, born 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was absolutely clear, that I wasn’t going to be an artist, ” she asked me if she wanted to follow in her parents ’ footsteps.
“ So I went to a high school science course and did everything I could to get away from it.
Then I realized I was running.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laugh.
She, like her father, has shown in many parts of the world.
A lot in Japan to film.
All the children of Baltasar and of the Christian congregation have followed the way of the arts.
“ I call this virus, ” says Mireya.
“ There was no way out of this. ”
Countes Icelandair have been in the gray area when the stewardesss was laid off
Social minister believes that Icelanda has been in a gray area when the Society quit all the stewardess in the middle of a dispute.
Then he says that a law forbidding firemen to enter an apartment building will be taken into account after the fire on the Brosbourg path.
On July 17, Icelandair decided to quit all 38 stewardesses who were then serving at the club while the stewarde company was still on the national social table.
The Department of Conjugation was about whether Icelanda could take these statements, and it was expected that the case would be resolved for social security.
However, it never came to an end that the stewardess and Icelands met for 24 hours after the announcement.
On the other hand, Ásmundur Einar Dadason, a social minister, says that he thought that Icelandir’s decision was in a gray area and went to the right of payers.
“ My opinion is that this is a certain right to defend the employees.
When you're in conversation, when you're in a peacemaker's room, it's not an option to go this way.
It is obvious to me that this could not have been true.
I think it's quite clear, in my mind, that the men had entered the gray area there what it touched, says Ásmundur.
He will thus not speak of other companies taking the same route as Iceland.
“ You also see a dangerous debate that it is only natural to jump this system up to reduce this right, so I’m completely opposed. ”
In an explosion this morning, Ásmund was also asked about the government’s reaction to the fire on the streets of brothers at the end of June, where three died.
The minister now points to the investigation of the case at The House and the Engineers ’ Table, to which he directed.
“ Today’s law is that the fire department must not enter an apartment building.
I've specifically asked Housekeeping and Human Resources to see if there's any reason for any legal changes.
I'm ready to act on the legal changes it takes to reduce the likelihood that this could happen again," says Ásmundur Einar.
You can listen to the interview with Ásmund for the whole time in the player below.
The United States claimed to increase pressure from North Stream 2 - RT Business News
According to Welt am Sonnta, a representative of people who are aware of the issue, the U.S. government has made further efforts to force European companies to leave behind the gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which is led by Russia.
According to the newspaper, officials of the State Ministry, the U.S. Department of Money and Energy have contacted European contractors to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing in the project.
Up to twelve officials should have held at least two online meetings with the representatives of the companies during the last few days.
Those who witnessed the interview said that the Americans had “friendly ” tones emphasized that the United States wanted to prevent the reality of Nord Stream 2.
“ I think this is a very, very serious threat, ” said one of the droughts to the German media.
These threats are in accordance with Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of Foreign Affairs, last week, warning that companies who participate in the project would be best “get out now ” or risk punishment according to the 232 percent of the infamous County Laws of America's Adversies Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to Russian energy giant Gazprom, who supervises the development of the project, five European companies are involved.
This is the French Enterprise Engie, OMV from Austria, British-German Corporation Royal Dutch Shell plus Wintershal and More from Germany.
In a conversation with Welt am Sonntag, a representative of the firm said that the U.S. efforts to undermine a “important infrastructure” project was a clear intervention in the European Union.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Council approved a change in national protection laws designed to reverse the U.S. criminal action against companies participating in the installation of the Russian North Stream 2-gas induction.
According to one of the legal regulations, the provisions may be directed to companies that pay or supply ships, insurance, dock status, or linking services for such ships, as well as to those who offer evidence for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and government officials have repeatedly declared their disapproval of the U.S. efforts to interfere with European energy issues by punitively applying punishment against Nord Stream 2, some of which have even called for Brussels’s countermeasures.
In Moscow, authorities have also criticized the operation of Washington severely and have called it unreasonable competition.
Earlier this week, a spokesman for the Presidency, Dmitrij Peskov, told him that Russia would develop a new plan on how the project will be completed if Washington officials continue to carry out their new punishment measures.
Preparing for further transport of government institutions to land
Social Affairs and Child Services are planning to export more government agencies to land in the near future.
In the fall of the minister’s decision to move north to the north of the House of House and Human Resources Agency has previously declared that they are not planning to move north.
Ásmundur Einar Dadason, Social Affairs and Children's Department, said in the bombing this morning that it's important for the country to be transported there by public agencies.
Thus, there is a rich variety of valuables.
“ It is nationally important, we are trying to build everything around the country.
Job structure, currency structure, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some natural efficiency, and this kind of work are very well supported for this structure," says Ásmundur.
“ increasing diversity creates better support for this resource efficiency and the nation’s currency generation. ”
The decision of Ásmunds to transport the industrial and anthropological fire zones has been severely criticized by its employees and the National Association of firemen and medical personnel.
Six men who have expertise in burn business and work in the League are all living in the capital region, and none of them are planning to move to Sheepkok.
“ I think it’s clear that there are political differences in how hard this is to take place.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we must take steps to further the public work, says Ásmundur.
“ We can see that our neighbors, North and Danir have been doing this successfully. ”
He says that he believes that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
“ I think more political decisions are needed to be made on the move of public activity to the country, as I was doing with the House and Engineer Organization. ”
He takes an example of the transport of food clinics to Selfos, Iceland's National References to Akraness, and unemployment insurance on Skaga Beach.
“ Today, the workplace on Skaga Beach is important for that community.
I think we should take a further step into this creature."
“ I am preparing for further steps into this being.
Further transport."

A systematic racist and U.S. presidential decision to send FBI troops to cities to address riots was protested in many places yesterday.
On the fifth dozen Protestants were arrested in Seattle.
Seattle police used flash bombs and pepper spray in large protests where the police have described as riots.

In Portland, protests were heard to share their feelings with Protestants.
The U.S. president of the United States has repeatedly launched a severe conflict between police and Protestants after sending in unsolicited FBI squadrons.
Thousands met in Portland this weekend, using police tear gas and rubber balls when they were rushed between them and Protestants.
A Miracle Child of 47 Years
The American reality star Kenya Moore is doing good by strengthening people who need IVF.
Moore, known for his participation in The Real Housewires of Atlanta, acquired his first child at 47 years of age after undergoing assisted reproductive technology and calls her child a miracle child.
“ Almost all my life, ” said Moore in an interview with People.
“ So I know the anguish people experience, especially women, to think that I could possibly not have a baby. ”
Moore realized that she was running out of time when she was 40 years old.
“ I didn’t want to have a child alone.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited, and after 40, I looked up and thought good to my God," said Moore, who did not know his child father until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The reality star says his daughter is a miracle child in more than one way.
Besides Moore’s age was older than most of her firstborn, her daughter came into the world one and a half months before the set date.
Moore went to a czar that proved to be difficult and took much longer than traditional emperors.
“ I call her the miracle breast because it was a child that everyone said was almost no chance of having, ” said Moore during the interview.

A Doctor ran 35 kilometers in a mask
British doctor Tom Lawton ran on days 35 miles [35 km] with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation was not reduced by using a facial mask.
Lawton is a doctor at Bradford Royal Hospital and has been working there during the pandemic.
In order to disprove the doctrine of oxygen saturation and to encourage people to wear a facial mask, Lawton decided to run to work and back in a mask.
Before he set off, he formed a collection of GoFundMe for The Trusll Trust, who provides food supplies in Bradford and elsewhere in Britain.
“ I am a great supporter of all things that keep us safe.
That's why I've been in shock about the wrong information that's been transmitted to humans about the reduction of people's oxygen saturation masks," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously competed in tridents, but during the outbreak of the pandemic, his tolerance had diminished.
On Monday, on Monday, he ran the 35th mile.
“ I never took off the mask (no food or drink) and oxygen saturation stubbornly hardened 98% every time I looked, ” wrote Lawton on Twitter after the race.

An airplane crash in Utah: A child and two adults died in a backyard crash
Six people were on the Piper PA-32 plane that crashed in a backyard in West Jordan City on Saturday afternoon, according to Allen Kenitzer, U.S. FA.

Gottlieb warns that the spread of the crown virus in society makes it “very difficult ” for schools to open in the fall
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, warned on Sunday that it will be “very hard ” for schools to open in a new year if the crown virus spreads itself without a doubt within these societies.
“ I believe that local school authorities need to examine the distribution of the community.
If the virus spreads freely in the community, it will be very difficult to open up in that condition," said Gottlieb in the "File the Nation."
Since head teeth are due to begin in the next few weeks, Trump’s government had encouraged school officials to open their schools to students and offer lessons in schools five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and the head of the education minister Betsy DeVos arrive one week after Trump warned that the crown virus epidemic would likely “fall before it gets better ” and confirmed that school arrangements at the worst of the situation might have to be delayed from school for a few weeks.
Nevertheless, the Center for Disease Control issued instructions on how to open school for students on Thursday.
Among other things, the instructions require that schools be removed from people’s loyalty, students, and staff advise to use facial protection and that students are divided into social groups to reduce the number of infectious routes.
However, the Centers for Disease Control did not provide a standard for school managers when to close schools if coral infections are growing, which Gottlieb says were “unsatisfy. ”
“ When this uncertain state is established and specific instructions have not been given on how the schools will be opened, ” he says, “I think more parents will be careful.
“ That is why I consider it very important to know exactly what the standards are, which the CDCs did not provide in their instructions. ”
Gottlieb told school examples, the share of positive infections in the community, local spread, and testing ability must be considered when deciding whether to keep schools open or to switch to online teaching.
If between 5 and 10 % analyses give positive results, the “experience is successful ” but above 10 % is“ the threshold when it is carefully considered whether to close school sufferers. ”
“ This is a sign that the epidemic has established in the community, ” said Gottlieb, adding that it would do parts of Florida, which are centrally central to the Korean epidemic in the United States, is difficult to open for schooling next month.
The number of chronic viral infections has increased to more than 30 countries and Colombian regions, while the center of the pandemic is located in the solar belt, so - called on the southern coast of the United States.
Gottlieb, however, said that there was evidence that it had begun to slow down the growth of cases in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
Even though Gottlieb had said that there was “a clear signal ” that it was slowing down the epidemics in some solar states, others, including South Carolina, Alabama, India, and Illinois are becoming“ heated up in the coals. ”
Many governors have established rules that require the use of masks in public schools and have halted phase replacements to counteract the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that a state should consider closing bars, restricting the number of people at restaurants, closing cinemas, and other places offering internal entertainment and setting rules on masking use to overcome the epidemic, which are measures that allow countries to avoid retake of the strict restrictions set up at the beginning of the March epidemic.
In addition to the use of masks by various countries, various companies have been obliged to use facial protection.
The fastbiter McDonald's is the latest company to make the use of a face-protection program and to add it to a group of enterprises such as Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own masking rules.
Gottlieb said that he assumed that more companies would adopt a masked family, especially where the danger is considered high.
“ If we can really control the epidemic when winter comes, until we get a vaccine or some treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease, we can do it in masks, it's relatively simple, something we can all do, but that doesn’t change our life directly and lets us keep what's very important to us, as if keeping some companies open and getting the kids back to school, ” he says.
Despite the fact that Donald Trump last week did not say that he wanted to make a masking use in the country, he urged the Americans last week to use facial protection and said at the White House press conference that they were “working. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: “There is a time to expect ”
The Crystal Palace fans received a shell for the summer when Roy Hodgson, director of the Society, declared it over the parisher Waff Zaha wanted to leave the club.
It has been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now appears to be leaving, but it has been said before to such joints as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
As he is now 27 years old, he will reveal whether a member of that quality is still willing to pay high sums for him, especially during financial uncertainty during the summer season, after a period of four limits, and made five basiss for the Palace Team, which caused several disappointments.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that the “good news was to be expected ” regarding the possible departure of Zaha after affirming that the parisher had“ made it clear ” that he saw his future elsewhere.
There are still three years left for the parisher’s agreement with Palace, and last year the Society indicated that 100 million steroids would be needed for the Society to give it up.
Hodgson’s team completed the period with seven consecutive losses and a draw on the last day of the season, resulting in a fall to 14th place.
Zaha found the netmasks only once from mid - December to the end of the period with a long shot in losses against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for sale last summer when he tried to get out of the club, but there was no offer to tempt Palace to sell.
In January, Zaha changed his agent, apparently to increase the likelihood of getting out of the club, and in the next few weeks, he will no doubt have to take the first place in ensuring social exchange.
Zaha is the player who played most of the minutes in the English League for Palace during the season and was the only player of the team under 28 years of age who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much rebuilding of the team might be necessary to apply with the money available to the player.
Tornado Hanna: The Condon of the state of Texas faces a great risk of disaster in a “two - fold crash ”
Weather reporters have predicted “vagin floods ” in southern Texas after the hurricane Hannah reached two countries and brought heavy rains and wind strength up to as much as 40 meters per second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first phase storm (lowest score on a five-point scale) and has now been transferred to a tropical storm, but rain could still be 150-300 mm on Sunday and the wind could reach 26 meters in seconds.
In some areas, rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County on the Mexican border.
Hanna was the first hurricane season in the Atlantic in 2020, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield advised the people to be on guard: “It is not yet over; we are still expecting a flood of disasters. ”
For the last few weeks, Texas has had a lot of increase in crown virus infections.
Governor Greg Abbott published a disaster report for 23 territories that will be in the way of the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are a tremendous challenge.
This challenge is complex and even harder where the hurricane passes through an area that's been worst because of VID-19," said Greg.
On Saturday, Saturday, the hurricane first arrived at a land some 30 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christi, some 24 miles [210 km] north of Port Mansfield.
The second time, it wasn't far off, East Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
An emergency service in Corpus Christi set up gardens near the block so that they can be used if there is a flood over the streets.
According to President Donald Trump of the United States, the government was watching Hannah and hurricane Douglas, who headed for Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the shore of Corpus Christi, said that the storm that approached would have added to the anxiety she felt because of the pandemic.
This 67 - year - old woman had mostly stayed home because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double plaque for us.
I think a lot of people have gotten nervous.
We're gonna get through this.
Everyone's good and strong, and they're together."

Original solution to the wolves - this is how they prevent the injuries
The Squareman Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English league, is a tremendously fast player.
His opposers had it to grab hold of him to make sure that he could not get past them.
This has caused his shoulder to drop several times, but now the wolves have provided a solution to the problem.
The Sun will tell you.
In a game of Wolves against Crystal Palace, orderlies could see something on Traoré's shoulders.
“ This is something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says one authority in Wolves, but what was being worn was child oil.
“ The making of it makes it harder for defenses to grab hold of it, and thus we can prevent further injuries. ”
Traoré's shoulder first fell off when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has fallen four times, now last against Sheffield United before this month.

Stott said: “I find what it says in no way different from what we read in the tabloids, except now in a bound book."
“ There's a storyteller, but it doesn't seem like it came from them. ”
“ I just think it's one more attack on them, just like the tabloids that persecute them. ”
“ I realize that they are in the limelight, and people want to know what they are doing, but I wish they were more interested in all the good things they have done and their charity, rather than their personal affairs. ”
“ Of course, they never get away from it, for their own sake. ”
The support of the Duke and the Duchess of Sussex overshadowed other members of the royal family, according to a specialist in the history of the royal family.
Dr. Kate Williams said to Sky News that the royal family had failed to use the star-friendly Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in their behalf.
She added that the governmental order within the royal family was fixed, but the public interest could not be controlled.
She also said: “The fact is that everything they did in support of the queen tended to overshadow other members of the royal family, and this was considered a problem. ”
“ They’re extremely popular. ”
“ They had less weddings than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, and Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“ But even though Harry and Meghan’s wedding was smaller in style than Willalm and Katrin, there was news of it as much, because of the great interest of the world on the couple. ”
Donald Trump admits that he often regrets his raus on Twitter
Donald Trump has acknowledged that he often regrets his movements on Twitter that fuel war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States said that his unconcerned revened manifestations of the Twitter transfers — some of which have contained material from white racialists — would get him into the greatest trouble.
When journalist Dave Portnoy asked if he would regret his assignments, Trump replied: “Too, too often.
It was so in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very large.
You put it on your desk, and then you came back the next day and said, “Oh, how glad I am that I didn’t send this, right?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out immediately, we feel great, and then you start getting calls — “Did you really say that? ”
I'll say, "What's wrong?" and you'll find out some things."
Last month, Trump caused a lot of anger after having redeveloped a transfer (detailed from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages region of Florida, where an elderly couple called "White Pope" or "Walmanship."
And in 2017, Trump rebid three contacts directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, the leader of the Right Age Class Britrin First.
The president told Portnoy that the reflections that had put him in the biggest trouble of all
Trump said: “You see something that doesn’t look good, you don’t understand, and you don’t know exactly what the helmet says, which is tiny, and you don't grow it, sometimes — I've found that it's almost always the reflection that puts you in trouble."
The president often shares praise with himself, raps on his opponents, and conspiracy teachings with his 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him get through the so - called "finger news" on television shows and newspapers, which he says are exposed to falsehood.
However, the President’s lies have often been discovered under the care of his eyes, and now Trump’s records are misleading.
The GPS may not be safe
A number of countries are working to develop different local technologies than the GPS.
An engineer says there may be a reason to be concerned about the safety of the GPS, owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been renovating.
GPS is following us on every foot.
We use it when we fly, sail, and drive, we do land measurements, industry, and leisure.
Most people do not think of it as a military instrument owned by the United States Army, which first opened it for general use in the 1980 ’ s.
The GPS uses coordinates from satellites 20 miles [20,000 km] above the earth, so the conditions in nature have little influence on it.
“ But she is easily disturbed.
And mean people can easily interfere with these signals," says Semundro E. Vorsteinsson, a lecturer in engineering at the University of Iceland, and an expert on risk management and security issues.
He also says that it is easy to send false signs with the wrong location, such as in warfare.
“ The GPS system is owned by the U.S. Department of Defense.
They have assured the public that the system exists at all times.
But they can certainly turn it off if it fell into the head of a very eccentric president to have it done, then he could probably do it," says Semmundur.
Therefore, many countries are considering other systems and local technologies.
Both the Russians and the Chinese operate their own satellite system, and the European Union is implementing the location system of Galileo from the stocks.
“ The Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may have more accuracy and is naturally controlled by the European Union.
Then there's not one government that entirely controls it, but many," says Semmundur.
But many people are also looking back at the old Ioran technology.
It's based on radio waves and was used from the '50s until GPS began.
The radio signals are sent on very long waves sent down on the ground.
“ It is then a new version of the Loran system, eLoran, which represents the Enhanced Loran, is seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a backup system, because it has a little other law to interfere with it, it is much harder than disrupting the satellite system, ” says Semmundur.
However, it is probably safer to have access to as many locations as possible.
An experienced member of the Parliament’s staff, Vern Buchanan, died from the crown virus
“ Gary was a professional in the fingertips and a faithful public servant, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched the lives of so many, and he was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how refreshing he was, his sense of humor, and his sheer joy of helping others."
Buchanan’s office published a statement in a tit earlier in the month, stating that the Tibbetts had no recent dealings with others in the office.
Tibbets, who served outside the office, had worked for Buchanan, 2011.
The state of Florida has reported 414,511 cases since the beginning of the pandemic, which is more than 411,200 in New York City, according to the National Health Authority.
Data from the State of Health show that hospitalisation has increased by 79% from the United States’s national festival Day, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 ICU in Florida reached tolerance limits on Saturday.
DeSantis said in June: “We were aware that this might have an effect. ”
“ At the same time, police work and making laws with this might have a reverse effect. ”
Cleared from Hornafrand to Cape Town
Dowdoves, roses, ringbirds, cross noses, dolls, and weepers are among the birds that have flocked to land this summer.
For example, on the site of Birds ’ meditation centers, near daily, news of the strays, where they have been seen, and sometimes their genders.
There are a lot of them in Iceland.
For one thing, there are numbers of people who like the Facebook page of Icelandic birds.
The members of the group are about 14,600.
There's divided pictures of birds and it's obvious that Iceland's rich in good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
Brylver Brylfsson is one of them.
Binni, as he is called, is the employee of the Southeastern Institute of Birds and the University of Southeasts, and closely monitors the bird life in that area.
He speaks beautifully of these animals that enrich life in Iceland, which play an important role, and it does not matter whether the bird is a large bird of prey or a small sparrow.
In 2005, the bird center was founded on the Day of half - dead Björn’s birthday in Burgers, with the goal of promoting and continuing the remarkable natural research he carried from 1940 onward.
“ The half - year - old coma was 13 years old when he started to make up information about birds, ” says Brynurur in a conversation with the Kjarnan.
“ We're not doing exactly what half - dead people did, but we're building on top of it by counting and marking birds. ”
Half - dead was a farmer and a common scientist born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific analyses about plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, nearly 90 years old.
His half - dead brothers and sisters in the Moriscos aroused the interest of many of the people they met in Icelandic nature.
This includes Björn Gísli Eagleson, “the other worker ” of the Bird Mansion Center.
Born in South Trinitarians, Björn received an abundance of natural food from his neighbors, half - dead in the field of the Cavors.
What, though, is it that the Bird Thinker’s Center in Southeast America does?
About March 20 each year, the Bird Thinkeries set up a special bird net in the Lonely, tree - venge near the Cape of the Hornafre.
It has standard labelling for the birds that come in the nets.
The nets are taken down around May 10 when the laying period starts.
They live every day, at least from about six o’clock in the morning and until noon.
And they need to be visited every hour.
The birds that come into them are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a journalist asks in the mud.
“ Yeah, we'll split it with ourselves, me and Björss.
Since we have to work for ourselves now, this can be a big puzzle, but somehow we'll manage this," says Brylur.
The Internet is then reassigned between August 1 and November 10 — every day that the weather allows.
Between observing the nets and during the periods they are not alive, Brylur and Björn are marking the terns, the cums, and various birds where they reach them.
In addition, they take on special assignments.
One of these projects is being cooperated with the National Institute of Natural Science and is about collecting ticks of birds.
“ The woodpecker jumps into the birds at their winter stations and then gets them to land in the spring.
This is just before they start, so these ticks aren't big when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find another host when he needs it."
But enough about ticks.
Asking about how the birds in the Southeast did that summer, Brynur says that the tern’s coat seems to be doing well — where it covers a verdant head.
“ The main challenge here is Hala, in the South, where everything is going well.
However, there is no longer a sound at the glacier, where a few years ago there was a huge lay."
A few years ago, he says that it was the village of over a thousand terns, but it is now possible to count them on one hand.
“ When we look at birds of the symmetry, I feel that it has diminished in the last few years what you find of them.
But, of course, there's always a change between years."
What can explain that big change, according to Brynjafjöft, is likely to be about supplying food.
“ It’s all about food, of course. ”
In this way, human works can also have a bearing on the survival of birds and other animals.
However, some birds seem to be quite comfortable in the Southeast that summer.
“ One of the things I think is positive, ” says Brynurur, “but during the past few years and decades, the number of sheep has been severely damaged. ”
Of sparrows, it seems that the marijuana is going to do well in its heat last summer, just as it did last year.
The number of woodboxes and youfututils had dropped somewhat, but Brylil says that it does not appear until the fall how this summer proved to be them.
But let's get back to the strays.
They often attract much attention, especially if they are very rare and even colorful.
These two fascinating features have one of the most popular strays in the summer: The Rosestar.
“ Another has been relatively quiet this summer in the vagrants, ” says Brynjull, but he notes that the country is now finding the grays, and then there have been ring pigeons, and they are here to lay their eggs.
When Brylur and Bjorn get to the surface of strays, they also mean them, just like other birds.
It is international, and it is practiced worldwide.
The meanings, e.g. every winter station of birds, where they lay, and what their routes are, can be achieved.
“ You can even see how long they are flying, ” adds Brynurur.
These data are practical in many ways, to form epidemics such as bird flu.
“ There is always an increase in knowledge. ”
If anyone in the world finds a bird that has been marked by the National Bird Management Centre, the information is sent to Iceland’s Institute of Natural Science.
“ From Cape Town, South Africa, we have recovered.
There we had marked a chromium.
One of our terns was found later in the United States."
One bird is the Brynjáður, especially the mind, and that is the skull.
“ The serpent is our bird, ” he says, pointing out that the Bird Manage Center and the University of Southeast America are the task of observing its survival — which has become very loose, and now they are on a list.
It is difficult to say what has caused a collapse in the root, but one theory is that the cum has made a level of seawater that was once thrown off fishing boats and into the sea rather than that it is now being used much better and affected by the mud.
Are you at the best spot in the country to watch birds?
“ You don’t make me say no, ” says Brynur laughing, adding: “Because we’re also chasing strays, I guess we have to go elsewhere. ”
But surely the Southeast is special when it comes to bird life.
“ This area is like treading into the land from Europe, and then the birds are spreading from here.
Being here looking at migratory birds and strays is very interesting, but this is less interesting than in many other parts of the country.
It's not far from the sea and to the glacier, so the area that's convenient for considering birds."
But the Brylur's favorite bird?
For a moment, he thinks about it before he answers.
The question is difficult.
“ I have found nine of the ten who have been seen in the land, ” he finally answers.
“ I now enjoy taking pictures of horse hawks.
Also, it's always nice to find birds that haven't been seen in this country before or that are rare, so I don't talk about finding a new species for Europe."
But that's what they've both done with your partner and Björn.
If you want to pay more attention to Björna's work at the Southeastern Birds Institute, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the website Birds.is
Saudi Arabia - Sun Coast for the future?
In recent years, the tourist industry has grown tremendously throughout the world, and now the authorities in Saudi Arabia want their share of the cake.
The government will consider spending some $6,000 billion on a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reports this.
But this tourist couple will not be in the style that we Icelanders are supposed to get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available, and women will not be allowed to sun themselves in bikinis.
How, then, should tourists be lured to this strict Islamic land?
This is to be done, for example, by building a new city that will become white beaches, moons (or, of course, man - made), tractors, and robots who serve people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to deposit in this investment.
Of course, the money will be picked up in the oil field.
The prince says that it is not a matter of discussion that women can let go of covering the shoulders and knees in public places, but at the same time admit that it is not easy to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot when the sun is high and cannot be trusted in the wind condition.
Yet, it can be considered whether it will also reduce the interest of prospective tourists if they are unable to buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, who was once deposed by the Central African Republic’s Presidency, announces the presidential campaign.
On Saturday, the former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been deposed, announced that he would volunteer in the Presidential election in December despite the fact that the United Nations took criminal action and that a warrant was issued for his alleged crimes against mankind.
He announced his campaign in front of a large group of supporters of his party, Kwa na Kwa (work, only work) in the capital of Bangui.
This 73 - year - old general and military chief were taken away in 2013 in the rebellion of an alliance with the greatest Muslim rebels from the north who plunged the nation, the majority of whom are Christians, into violent civil wars and serious and long - standing philanthropism.
“ The land needs someone with experience, peace, and conviction, ” said Bozize in a speech that was critical of the current presidential government, Fastin-Archange Touadera.
In 2003, Bozize began his reign after a coup and served as president for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against mankind and for promoting genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile in late last year.
It is not clear how the warrant or foreign criminal action affects his supply.
In January Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to remove the criminal action proposed in 2014 for the alleged support of armed Christian groups of Anti-balak.
Toudera controls the country today with the support of the United Nations Department of Peace, which counts as more than 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016, and it is expected that he will volunteer for a second term, but his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round of the election will be December 27th.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups that generally claim to defend the interests of certain societies or religions.
Since then, violent crime has decreased, but it is still a bloody incident that is the result of most of the resource conflict, but the majority of these diamond - rich countries are not under government control.
The violence has forced over 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Gareth Bale State at Real Madrid is “unacceptable for everyone, ” says Toni Krooos
Toni Kroos, middleman Real Madrid, says Gareth Bale of the Spanish team was “unacceptable for everyone. ”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he took little part in Los Blanco's LaLiga celebration, and now in the summer it's the state where the player intends to stay and make his deal run out, but the club hopes that he disappears.
“ There is no way to avoid the situation becoming unacceptable to everyone, ” said Kroos in the sound of Freechangriff Endlich Wasmit Sport.
“ He was not bought to play as little as he is now.
I think he actually wanted to leave the club last summer and that the club actually said "yes" and then said "no" later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about that.
When asked whether the situation had affected the atmosphere at Real, Kroos said: “Not as much as it might seem.
I've known him for six years and we've done some important things together."
The Chinese provide 2,000 face masks to support the fight with the crown virus
The Chinese ambassador, Jin Zhijian, gave up the mayor of the city of Smokejanes farm two thousand portrait masks last week.
The occasion was the mayor’s visit to the Chinese embassy last July 22th.
Good news first reported.
The mayor’s appointment was to repay the visit of the Chinese ambassador to the town of Smokenes, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
According to some news, there has been a discussion of promoting a community partnership between the city of Smokeyanes and the city of Xianyang, but the local community began its partnership between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, is rooted in this friendly business, but the city authorities in Xianyang wanted to wear masks and thus support the battle against the crown virus epidemic.
According to the News of Vikings, masks will be used in sensitive institutions and Smokenestown stations for both employees and other visitors.
In addition to Iceland’s flag and the Republic of China, the accompanying picture shows an inscription on the facial mask box entitled “Ber is one behind, except for a brother."
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculates to reduce his salary
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from Iceland's legalist KR, next month and says he's gonna be interested in the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has played Iceland since 2017 and has become Iceland champion with both Val and KR.
This 27 - year - old parisher, however, says that he is beginning to miss Denmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stephania, the daughter of James.
Dann’s contract with the KR is valid to the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish company would have to negotiate with the KR to get it in August, before a new season begins in Denmark.
If not, Thomsen would have to wait until winter to get to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know that the Danish Leagues resume at the end of August.
That means, of course, that I had to cancel my contract with the KR, but I've told them that I miss Denmark, and they have a complete understanding of it," said Thomsen to the bull.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with Coach Rúnar Christiansson, who had shown full understanding of his situation, and Thomsen said that he did not consider the price to be a big problem.
“ I’ve also had discussions with two 1st Divisions after the League was over and the team knew where they would end.
There's been a little interest already in the coming period, so it may well be that I'm going to Denmark before the Icelandic League stops," said Thomsen, but added that it's clear that there are not many societies in Denmark that could purchase his contract with KR.
“ It’s not quite clear now, but it has been interesting.
I also need to find the best chance for me and my girlfriend, who's from Iceland, who's coming with me.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen and demanded to look first to Copenhagen.
Thomsen said the KR people don't have to worry that he wouldn't give himself all into rehearsals and games, even if he missed Denmark.
“ I know what it gets from me, and that’s that I do 100 percent.
I can totally overlook the fact that I miss Denmark when I'm in rehearsals or games," said Thomsen, who says he's going to lower his salary by leaving the Icelandists in Denmark's secondmost platoon.
“ I will probably have to lower my salary a little, because of the crown virus crisis that seems to have snarled the Danish money law a little more than the Icelandics.
But I also study, and one solution might be that a company would get me a job.
Of course, most of the 1st Platoon's budget has an agreement with sponsors.
I'm learning sports control through the human society, and I'm finishing the bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been a first-class KR in two Pepsi Max teams in this season, but he's been involved in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 for last year's team and scored seven targets.
KR is equal to the top of the Pepsi Max Division, but the people are fighting KA in Akureyri today.
Hit the crown virus on a bus when a driver gets into a hot fight about a face mask
The video shows passengers and drivers aboard Arriva Street bus in Liverpool to handle masking use.
The driver hears a woman explain that it is not his job to tell passengers to wear a mask.
The driver said: “It’s not my job to tell everyone who gets on the bus to wear a mask."
This witness said of the incident: “A man and an older woman started to take on her, and a great argument broke out. ”
“ The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was going on, and he told one woman that she wasn’t even wearing her mask right. ”
“ This woman, ” he said, “went off from the wagon and said,“ said she would report the incident. ”
Ariva’s spokesman said: “The shadow of our customers and our employees is as good as our priority.
“ Our clients are, in fact, obliged to wear masks when using public transportation (uncommunications applicable).
“ Clarifys directions and labelling for customers about this, and all the other laws are on board buses, on social media, and on our websites. ”
Maturity has been involved in public transportation since June 15.
More than 16.3 cases of VID-19 have been identified worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the global crown virus.
Most cases of VID-19 have been identified in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood recruiting people with disability more often in role
The actress joins in a new campaign on increased participation in recreational disability.
The campaign is going on at the same time as 30 years have passed since the U.S. law on the rights of those with disability, which occurs on Sunday.
In the video Spencer discusses the importance of seeing yourself and life reflected in a real way on the screen.
“ Nothing can replace personal experience and genuine publication, ” she says.
“ That’s why it is so important to hire an appropriate actor for an appropriate role. ”
Spencer discussed the effect she suffered from seeing black people on the screen when she was a little girl watching the "Good Times" show.
The factors shown in CBS between 1974 and 1979 were created by Norman Lear, and they paved the way for the first comedy program to show two African parents.
A Organization Against Hunger push Yoho aside after an incident at the House of Congress
WASHINGTON — No matter what Christian organization would want to bring an end to famine, they said on Saturday that they had asked the council member Ted Yoho to resign from the organization’s government and that he would have responded, after what they called an attack on the congressman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, a New York City congressman, accused Yoho, a member of Repollikana, Florida, of using low and male Chemacious abuse words when he rebuked her when they met at the steps of the councilhouse last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed that the incident confirmed that the wording was as it said.
In a resolution declared that the WI government had met Yoho on Friday and sought out that he said of himself “to justify our commitment to stand up with women and blackhearted people, local and global, leading us toward a world with increased involvement of all races and increased justice."
On the Bread for the World website, their “stirred voice ” exerts pressure on the council and the government to bring an end to hunger in the country and worldwide.
“ Since the British for the World is independent of the Christian organization, which has the goal of reducing hunger and poverty with sound official policies, the organization upholds the respect, dignity, and compassion that Jesus asks us to show when dealing with people in positions of authority, wherever it is in the political spectrum, ” says the declaration.
“ In our opinion, recent actions and words of congressman Ted Yoho, reported in the media, do not reflect the moral standards of our members. ”
By the progress of the story, Yoho's spokesman had not responded to an invitation to email.
Last Thursday, in an amazing talk at the councilhouse, Ocasio-Cortez reported the incident and directed his words against what she called male embodiction as “constant to violence and violent speech against women. ”
More than a dozen of her colleagues agreeed with her that the incident was an example of far too common male behavior.
Yoho described the incident as a brief discussion of policy and that “no one had been bothered, bullied, or attacked. ”
He said that he regretted having displayed a “slow manner of attitude. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in his first period as a progressive congressman and has received both praise and read for her purity.
The 65 - year - old Yoho is one of the most conservative members of the council and will retire after his fourth term.
Wait until 98. minute for the final play to score the first target of the season
Jesse Lingard had not scored or joined the English elite in this season, until he challenged Leicester today for 98 minutes on the final tour of the unit.
In December 2018, Lingard had not scored an English elite unit since he challenged Cardiff twice.
He came in as a backup today for Manchester United when the people met Leicester in the championship game for the League.
When more than seven minutes had passed past the normal season, the Caper Schmeichel targeter of Leicester was picked up by Lingard and cut to the empty finish line.
It's a long shot at Jesse Lingard.
Real Madrid Players Refused for Disease Control
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to reach England in their second game with Manchester City, the European Masters ’ League, without having to go to a two - week fever.
The British government has decided that tourists from Spain need to go to two weeks of lagoons in order to control the spread of the crown virus.
However, there are exceptions, as in the case of the highest level sports contest.
This confirmed the State Department of Sports with Sky Sports.
The Ministry says that individuals who are left to rules will only be in designated areas, at closed doors.
This applies to sports stars, judges, coaches, medical teams, and media people.
Therefore, the Madridns may meet Manchester City on August 7, without having to stay long in England, but they are 2-1 below the duel after losing on Santiago Bernabeu on February 26, England.
The winning team will make it to the 8-to-1 finals that are going on in Portugal.
Exploiting and pacing over the country on business weekends
From reports of overcrowded hotels and tents, at least south, it is clear that the Icelanders have been busy traveling abroad during the summer.
Have those who have set sail also had extreme luck with DV weather and weather items agreeing that the summer has only been said beautifully, until at least.
But it is time for a shopping weekend that has so far been the largest tourist weekend of the year.
Yet, it is unclear how this year will be compared to other weekends, since events that in the average year have attracted a great crowd to not being held.
For example, there is plenty of national festivals.
The weather will, of course, play a large role, but now it looks like pouring all over the country, but especially south and southwest.
The Weather Service predicts a rainfall from Thursday evening and at least until Saturday evening.
It should be noted that long - term predictions are not true here in the north Atlantic and are likely to change.
According to meteorologist Einar Sjörbjörn, his forecast on the weather website, Bluku, is that shopping weekends are being expected.
He says: A draught in the skies with a cold that too often also reaches down to the surface, so that when warmer air from the southwest tries to get closer, it only develops as wind and rain.
Of course, a warmer air that “hurts ” this north.
In support of his predictions, Einar says: “A small wave from America travels toward the east with some warm air.
As it approaches, it reaches a ‘ blooming ’ in the form of lowering air pressure and an ideological summer. "
The Great Predictions, the European algorithms on the left of the map, and the American GFS projections on the right are quite parallel with this development.
The score goes over late Thursday and early Friday with sharp A-ways and rains on most of the country.
The centre of about 985 hPa follows.
This time there is quite warm air in the North and East on Saturday and even Sunday as well.
On the other hand, it may blow.
A man was seriously injured is a cattle-created car in Wexford
A man was seriously injured in a traffic accident earlier today at the Ferrycarrig Bridge in Wexford.
A cattle truck rolled over on the bridge and rolled over to a non-stop car.
The 34 - year - old driver suffered a serious injury during the accident, which occurred at about 13:50 today.
He was moved to the hospital in Wexford, where he's in a heavy state.
The police's technical department is investigating the scene, and the bridge has been closed, and the exits have been set up.
A lot of cattle killed in the crash.
Police urge everyone who traveled through the road from 13:45 to 1300, as well as others in the area who may have witnessed the incident, to contact the U.S. police station in Wexford, telephone 053 916 5200, stand-on police in 1800 666 111, or another police station.
After a actress from Law and Order, all the way to New York
“ I had a crush on her like a man getting one of those young shots, ” says Birna Björnsson of the Mariska Hargitay, leading actress of the series Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so naked with the actress that she showed up at the scene and waited for her for hours, just to say hello.
When Birna Sjörn Björn Björn, owner of the traveling agency Pink Iceland, watched as many Icelanders watched the action show Law and Order: Special Victis Unit from the turn of the century, she scoured for the leading actress of the Marisque Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her meetings and the actresses in the show Love Story on Channel 1.
When Birna herself was a teenager, the age that many begin to develop intense love shots, she did not experience it as her peers did, for she was very determined to suppress her own feelings.
She pretended to be interested in boys bandes and young, gilling, biographyy, but she didn’t.
“ I was cutting popcorn and hanging pictures on a wall of Backstream boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes when people come out of the closet, they go through late puberty.
“ We spend our teenage years suppressing these impulses, these shots, and so on.
I think that was one of the things that drew me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just into her. "
When she was in New York a few years ago, she ran to the actress’s rope.
One of her best friends, Erdar Otttar Thordosen, was shooting a movie in that city and getting Birna and their friend Gunnar the son of Guðjón to help with the shooting.
“ We were working on a 30 - person crew and spending a lot of time with strangers.
It's a natural atmosphere when you spend so much time together each day, so it was all about everything and nothing."
One day Birna is a huge fan of Mariska.
One woman in the crew told her friend about the actress because he was part of the show.
Bear could not stop thinking about that fact, and she regularly asks her new friend how her friends like working with the actress and whether Birna can see her.
“ She tells me to stop it, she doesn’t know if she can make it happen, ” says Birna.
When the film is finally over, the group and Birna are trying to convince the woman to try to arrange the meeting.
“ She had had had a few drinks and said she would just fix it. ”
A few days later, Birna sends a message to the woman and asks if something is going on.
The woman does not answer, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she wakes up at a long - awaited message.
“ I look at the phone and scream over me.
Gunnar's weekend wakes up at the screams and I say, "I have to take a shower, and I'm gonna have to go to town nice."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friends, actors, and cameramen Law and Order were at a hotel in Times Square.
“ I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but it's the name of the hotel, good luck, ” she says in the messages, and Birna dressed in a hurry, asking where the group is going to shoot and pick up the elevator on the 45th floor.
Bear sets up and waits for a member of the staff to come to her and ask this woman if she can help.
“ I said I was looking for Jason, and I asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived. ”
When his friend finally arrives, he looks down at Birna and asks how she was able to get to the end of a tight security program.
Birna explains that she just took the elevator and asked to see Mariska.
“ Yes, I don’t know.
Sit down here," says the friend and the Bears sitting around.
At her side there's an extra in the show, and they start talking.
“ I say to him, ‘ I am a fan, but you? ’ says Birna.
“ I played it like it was the most natural thing in the world. ”
Time goes by and Birna's waiting.
The actors regularly appear during a break, have a snack, and Birna looks around and looks for Mariska, who is nowhere to be seen.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he is leaving.
Bear asks him to put himself in the hands of another employee, but she did not think of going anywhere right away.
Wonderingly, your friend agrees and gets another employee.
“ He brings his second friend and says, ‘ This is the woman from Iceland who wants to see Mariska. ’
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, our new friend arrives running to Birna.
“ He says: ‘ Hurry!
These are unusual situations today, there are journalists with it, so it won't stop.
She's going straight in the car with them, so you have to take the chance and go down and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
“ So I look right and I lose my face, ” Birna IVs, and I take the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds about 40 trailers, some marked and some not.
Mariska’s trailer, however, does not find her, and then it is desperate to be croaked.
“ I can feel the rejection coming on because I had spent half a day doing this, but then I thought, well, I tried.
That was fun."
Hopelessly, Birna is holding back towards the hotel, where she sees through the window of the camera crew watching her with spring blue eyes, realizing that the Bird was unable to accomplish his mission.
Birna accepts fate, and it starts to rain.
“ I go under a shelter to cover up the rain.
Then I look right and I lose my face."
No other than Mariska Hargitay was standing there in her pants, which she wore in the show, and Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly move with emotion.
“ I look at your body and your hands and think now you have to move.
Now you have to go in the direction of her."
Bear does so and dares to pick up the actress’s shoulder.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I'll just say hello, "I'll remember Birna.
“ I say I’m from Iceland, and I’m a big fan.
She says, "It's so nice to meet you."
The conversation was not much further, since Mariska’s car has arrived and she is whistled.
Mariska turns to Birna and says, “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you."
Bears take the idol, watch the car drive away, fold together.
“ I would call Erling and Gunna, and they thought it hadn’t worked.
But I was crying for excitement and joy.
I say, "Yes, I see her, you have to see me now."
Then we toasted in soda and tequila, says Birna.
Although she admitted that she would probably not repeat the game, she regrets nothing.
“ It’s like this once in a lifetime, wasting this kind of time and energy on such things.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Birna Björn Björn in the show Love Story on Channel 1.
Police Can’t Spread the Virus
There is no question about the concern that the crown virus can be transmitted by the use of alcohol that the police use.
This is what a police officer in a police traffic unit in the capital area said in a conversation with mbli.
Tips have been received from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police begin, appear on a roadside, and lets all who pass through the air.
The police say, however, that it is clean and clean.
“ It’s not really a special mouthpiece, ” says a police officer, “but we recommend a cup that people blow in. ”
“ Some people like to lay their lips on this, but we direct people to a little distance, up to a few miles. ”
Asked if it feels enough distance, a policeman says so.
Try to be positive, then the police use another measure.
It has a mouthpiece, which comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
Abdominal distension: Among other things, you can take in ice to reduce pain
The association with depression is not random.
Individuals suffering from inflammatory bowel disease, a condition characterised by abdominal pain, seizures, bloating, flatulence, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening symptoms in the United States Anxiety and Depression Association (ADAA).
“ This is because the colon is part controlled by the nervous system that responds to stress, ” explains ADA.
If this does not result in a reduction in the number of bloatings, there may be food intolerance.
The judge tries to stop the decision that children should be released from the custody of the Isthmian Authority
On Saturday, in his decision, Justice Dolly Gee canceled the future deadline by saying that the U.S. immigrant and customs authorities do not have to release children if one of the three ways described in its first decree cannot be done.
However, Gee also stressed in his decree that immigrant and customs authorities would still be obliged to release their children without unnecessary delay.
The three routes Gee stated are to release families held by immigrants and customs authorities, to place children in the hands of a responsible person, or to release families to a federal court order.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of the Agency Proyecto Dilley, who holds families in law service, condemned the decision, and told her to put it in the hands of the immigrants and customs authorities to decide whether to keep children in custody.
“ The thing is, I feel that children are kept temporarily free, and they don’t get out unless the immigrants and customs authorities agree with it or families agree to be separated, ” said Fluharty.
Families are held at three locations of immigrant and customs officials in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas, and Karnes County.
The children in these places are between 1 and 17 years of age, according to legal and legal advisers.
Gee, who supervises the implementation of the Floors Treaty on Child Care in Keep, said in June that since “the masking and social distance regulations were not available or poorly followed, ” it would be important to move children away from these stations.
969 persons in custody at the INS and customs authorities have been identified with the crown virus and are in isolation or surveillance from the 23rd of July, according to the INS and customs authorities.
There are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley and two in the Center for Family Security.
A total of 3700 cases have been confirmed in the maintenance phase.
Will review the legalization of governmental independence
The prime minister does not say that pension funds set standards in their investment policy for the rights of workers.
The comments of the Central Bankmaster on the need to ensure the independence of the executives of pension funds, possibly by law, will be taken into account.
After Icelandair broke up with Iceland's Flight Island Company and gave up all the stewardess board, VR declared that directors appointed by VR for the Penitentiary Fund or voted against the involvement of the Penitentiary Fund in the coming portion of Iceland.
Robert Thor Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of the VR, went on to say that governments would be replaced if they did not comply.
Robert Thor, as well as VR’s management, withdrew his statement three days later.
Ásgeir Jónsson, a money banker, said in the RuV News Friday morning that the independence of directors of pensions in the approved funds and possible legal change would be necessary.
The prime minister Katrin, Jacob’s daughter, says it is important that life - saving authorities are independent, but they already feel secure by law.
“ Of course, ” she says, “a financial bank manager who has this to do with has said that the rule work around this independence needs to be considered.
Katrin says that the law requires pensions to set moral standards in their investment policy.
It is preferable to discuss the social and moral standards that they want to highlight in their investments.
“ I didn’t feel abnormal, too, that pension funds also set standards for their investment policy of working people’s rights.
But I think it's normal that such decisions are made through policy but not through individual investment decisions," says Katrin.
“ An Insufferable traffic jam on the Alf - Year Bridge, ” says the president of the City Board of Year
S. Haraldsson, president of the city council, says traffic jam, formed on the Alf-year bridge of Selfossi every day is completely intolerable.
He hopes that for the sake of a new bridge over Alfausa will be served in the fall.
Now that Icelanders are traveling through their country, and heavy traffic on the country’s highways creates daily traffic jams on Alfausion Bridge when drivers are on their way to Selfss or through the community.
Long rows form on the edge and can take the patience of drivers to wait in a row.
“ Yeah, it's an intolerance, it's one traffic jam here, and not just on Fridays, because it's only been active days, too.
There are long baths, sometimes quite up to Hellishol for those who want to get by here on their way east to land and those coming west, so it gives us a way that we need a new bridge, and no later than yesterday, says Weekly S. Haraldsson, president of the city council in Abilities.
A weekend says that the city of Aurbians recently met with the director of the roadmaker and the designer of the roadmaking, and that meeting was very positive.
“ If you've ever had an optimistic outlook that there's work on these things, I think I can say this now because there's really work in this, and we should be able to see that a new bridge will be invited out in the fall. ”
But is there any way for drivers who are in the queue at the Alfbes Bridge every day during the summer season?
“ Yes, you can go through the straits and through the island’s banks, faster than those going east, you can’t point them out to go to the Löngdalhagne, but those going to the riots should use Mosfellhagur, Theory and Lörggard. ”
S. Haraldsson, president of the City of Town, says traffic jam, formed on the Alf - Year Bridge at Selfoss indistinguishable.
Long waitings develop each day on the Alf - Year bridge, and drivers often have to wait for a considerable amount of time to cross the bridge.
If so, the only advice is to take a deep breath and think something positive.
The future of a world of coalab bears in the north of Brisbane lies ahead for organizational planning.
The city government said that in addition to the life - threatening home of the coalabs, kulki, and the gray bashauk, it was an important link between the environments of Cabgage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
The managers have appealed to the Court for planning and environment to the Court, arguing that the structure is in accordance with the law on urban planning since 2014 would meet an unsatisfactory planning and community requirement for this and “can be carried out without adequate influence. ”
There is intense opposition to these proposed activities in the near environment.
The managers argue that despite the complete proposal in accordance with the organization, it could be adjusted if it fails to meet requirements rather than refuses.
At present, there are many stages, including a service station, child - care center, and 39 homes.
The official introductions were more than 120 at the meeting time, and most protested to the proposal as it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The leader of the minority of Brisbane’s city council said that the city had to buy the land to protect the coala bears.
“ The mayor] Adrian Schranner has to stop wasting the taxpayer's money fighting an agent for court and buying this country to protect Brisbane's natural and animal life, ” said the city official Cassie.
“ It is one of the most important homes in the nature region of Mountain to Mangroves, where there are many coalab bears. ”
Schranner said this week that the city council wanted to be protected by the coalabs in the area.
“ We felt the proposal was not suitable for the area, ” said Schnerer.
“ I understand that this is now going through the judicial system, and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive result that will lead to the preservation of our home. ”
Schranner said that the map of the home of koala bears is a common responsibility for city government and government, but the government was responsible for accurate maps of the celibar home that the local authorities support when they take applications for treatment.
Sow: The next step is to win something
Ole Gunnar Solskajana, coach Man Utd, was hoping that the people would secure their third place in the English league today.
Thus, during the next period, the European Masters ’ League will play.
United needed a draw or victory against Leicester today, and it was the result of the 2-0 victory of the Red Demons.
“ A great achievement for the players to reach third place according to the situation in the season.
I think that we students may have been able to overcome spiritual gossip by winning such a big game, since we've lost twice in the semi-finals during this period.
We knew we needed the finals today, now we can start the next chapter that's with these boys to win titles," said Solkjön winner.
Manchester United still has a chance to win a title during this period, but it's the end of the European League in August, and it's as good as 8 - second outcome there.
Parley begins at midnight in Eastern Ukraine's War
Kiev, Ukraine — the Ukrainian army and resistance forces in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a “complete ” cease - fire that is due to begin at midnight, and the delegates hope to be the first step toward peace after six years of conflict.
Consumers of resistance said on Sunday that they had ordered a cease - fire to their soldiers and issued a decree against the use of weapons.
The Ukrainian army said their forces have “repared ” for the cease - fire.
If this is accomplished, it would “praise the way for the implementation of the Minsk Peace Meeting, according to a statement by the Ukraine office earlier this week, where the cease - fire was called breakthroughs.
The Minsk Peace Conference, which was made up of 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and apartheidists that are part of Russia, which began in 2014 after Russia’s introduction to the Crimeans and the support of the country for apartheid.
More than 14,000 people have died in the struggle.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine both welcomed the cease - fire during the Sunday call and stressed the importance of making the agreement that was met at the meeting in Paris in December.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed concern about the cry of Kiev that the Minks Association should be revised and said that Voldimir Særij, Ukraine president, should be reflected in real action.
In contrast, the need to take more action to free the Ukrainian prisoners of the rebels in East Ukraine, the members of the Crimea and Russia, was stressed by a statement from the president’s office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only gain control over bordering with Russia in areas where apartheidists have power when they have received extensive self - control and when elections have been held in the area.
The meeting reduced the struggle, but the Ukrainian army and the rebels have continued to launch.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany met in Paris in December to have other talks, the Minsk Conference was supported and agreed to resume the peace process.
Swedish, who won the election in 2019 with promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to gain control over the border before the first regional election, but the Kreml government insists that the contract be made without changing.
The new cease - fire agreement was met on Wednesday by a three - side cooperation group appointed as representatives of Russia and Ukraine as well as the European Security and Cooperation Organization, which was therefore hailed by the EU officials.
Upon the traditional Sunday balm of Petertorgi, Pope Francis also referred to the cease - fire, saying that “the people need to be built up and laid down for the very necessary and long - awaited reconciliation. ”

Marka soup for the First Victory of Bulika in July
On June 29, Brea moment won his first regimental victory when the people killed the IA, 5-20.3, in the Pepsi Max Company of Men at the Kopavogsfield tonight.
The Scotsmen, on the other hand, lose their third game in a row in the league.
After winning his first three games in the league, Breathable five games played without celebrating victory and had passed three in a row for the game in Italy tonight.
So it was enough, or it was to die, for Blaus, who came into the game with great power.
In 11 minutes after his Christian son Steindorsson had sent him through defense IA, Alexander saviged his crew.
Six minutes later, a Christian doubled the lead after a careful preparation of Gíslis the son of Elelf from the left side.
The tax collectors did not make it to land or beach in their first half, where the high pressure of the local population made it a fortune to link shipments together.
Blitzens had all the power on the field, and the third mark was reaped in 36 minutes when Dan Thomas Mikkelsen struck the corner of Henblinson.
Then the Christian son of Steindor scored his second goal, and the fourth goal of Blasika was only three minutes later.
However, the first half of the story did not end there.
The tax collectors received a glimmer of hope for the second time when Trygven Haraldsson was cut out of scribble shortly before a break, but Kwame Quee had then broken the clumsy part of Viktori Jonsson within the trunk of Bukka.
Thus, 4-1 was the site for Brena moment when the half-strike gall.
Only three minutes had passed since the second half were passed when the Skaga people had rescheduled.
Saevar Jónsson’s warmth was then left alone, uninvestigated on the goal of Bilika, and easily directed the ball into the net by the corner of Tryggan the son of Harald.
On the other hand, warmth occurred within just three minutes of breaking Alexander Helga’s body.
Vitabola was sentenced, and Thomas Mikkellen was safely challenged to get Brenabolus 5-2 over just seven minutes of the second half.
Five minutes after Miktelens' target, the Skagaars were reassigned.
Anton Ari Einarsson, the goal guard of Bika, then landed under pressure from Viktor Jonsson, gave the ball to Viktor's foot from where the ball was turned down.
An amazing position of 5~3 was seen when less than ten minutes had passed since the second half, which was followed by a slow score.
Despite the fine range between both teams to add a limit, including the two deaths of Kwame Quee from Breindabub, they did not become more and the 5-3 victory of Brendablik.
Brea moment thus won his first victory for less than a month, from June 29, and has passed after the victory at 14 points in third place, two points from the choice that is above, and three from the top point KR.
However, KR and Valur are both involved in Bika.
AT A, the third loss in a row is to be accepted in the League, but it has ten points in eighth position, five points from the fall zone.
Despite the White House's comment, no danger to the control team.
Yesterday, the manufacturers of the Hvolapa Company felt that there was no need to stop showing the baby stuff in the near future.
The statement follows Kayleigh McEnky, the White House media official, that the factors that include law enforcement dogs were a victim of “distinctives. ”
Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnny’s words and explained that their fans had no need to worry about the future of Hvolapa.
A number of TV series covering police jobs have been taken out of a show in the United States recently following a protest against police violence.
However, although there was a rumor on the social media, there is not even the control of the group.
At a press conference at the White House on Friday, McEnny said that President Trump was opposed to "dissolved" and especially when the police arrived.
The term refers to the fact that when comments or actions of individuals or corporations provoke a severe reaction on social media, it is referred to as being avoided in protest.
“ A few weeks ago, we saw a show on the Hvolapa squad, child content about cops, was stopped.
Similarly, Cops and Live PD," said McEnny on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish choreographer Lego took out a law firm, but no foot is for that claim, according to the leader of Lego.
It is true, however, that Cops and Live PD events have recently been taken out of a Western showing.
Both factors include the section for showing footage of real police jobs without the permission of those who appear there.
Together for 29 years - Sometimes jealousy and suspicion come up
Consider the questions raised by readers regarding family, children, and love in the family corner of DV.
This time she answers readers who have never been single.
We've been together since we were 15 years old, been together 29 years, and have two children.
We know nothing but being together and feeling good, but we both feel that we are missing out on something.
We have never been with other people, and we have no comparison as to how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust in connection with whether the other person is looking around, thinking about adultery, even divorce, and changing.
When we discuss this, we agree to grow in our relationship, but this is such a bruise that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a wonderful question, and I am so happy that you have so frank communication that you can discuss your complex feelings about your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking this in each corner, you couldn't discuss this and even take some steps that you could later regret.
Everything on tables, isn't it always best?
Strong self - image is the most predictor of future happiness and the more self - image you possess, the more likely you are to develop a marriage mate with a strong sense of identity.
Often, the reasons why relationships that start during adolescence not always last for life are that people develop in either direction, but in cases where common effects, individuals may become stronger than many others.
Since your relationship begins to develop during your most formative years, we can conclude that you have developed together and have a positive effect on each other’s identity.
You see, the relationships we're in are the ones we're dealing with.
The way I speak, the way you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relationships shape who we are.
Could you turn the example around and think, ‘ What do we have that others do not have? ’
What does those years of speciality give us?
I allow myself to claim that the benefits can be quite largeer than the faults.
You have molded each other for years, and as a result, you can say that you are special in one inch of each other.
That's more than many people can say.
Worth it?
You talk about the fact that you have missed something, but it is important to remind yourself that big changes, such as divorce and new relationships, are also associated with fish that you are not necessarily excited about.
You may be missing out on starting over, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and putting together families.
This presents new challenges, different problems, and possible new and exciting things.
But it's not just a pink cloud and happiness, no, no, at your age, it can become a complex task, which may never be as effective as you've already done to each other.
Is it worth it?
Or would it not be wise to place the focus on what you can do to increase tension, unpredictability, and innovation in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on the shelf yet.
There are so many things you can do to make this long relationship even deeper.
What attempts can you make in connection with that?
What do you need from your mate that you are not receiving?
What can you give your mate that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Would you like to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, there is much more tolerance for various relationships and couples, e.g. open relationships, polymaths, or temporary discontinuation.
I'm not telling you what to do. I don't know what to do. I mean, if you don't know what to do, no expert in your solutions, but if you look at this and think about solutions, it might ease this heavy fat.
What, then, do you need your distrust and fear to disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, it must mean you're capable of a lot of things together.
Take advantage of it as strength, and hold your hand toward your deliverance.

Coleen Rooney's attorney Johnny Ding at the "Wagatha Christie" Battle of Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against accusations against Rebekah Vardy
After discussions between the football players ’ spouses ended up expecting their acquaintances to make a dramatic contribution.
Coleen Rooney has hired the star lawyer in the enigma of Johnny Leep to defend himself in his so - called "Wagatha Christie" legal dispute with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday simulations that Rooney has committed David Sherborne to defend herself against the accusation that she had suffered a swearing against Vardy, claiming that personal information has been leaked to the press by her closed Instagram access.
The news comes a few days after the evidence was presented to the Supreme Court, which shows that Rebekah Vardy, married to parisher Jamie Vardy of the Leicester City soccer team, suffered physically and spiritually from Coleen Rooney’s claims.
According to the report, the 38 - year - old mother “had severe panic attacks and panic attacks, so she was afraid to leave the house ” and that Vardy, who was then seven months pregnant,“ was hospitalised three times... because of the anxiety resulting from her entry and its consequences. ”
In addition to being a lawyer in his pleading case against The Sun, because of claims that the actor has beaten his wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, goes with the Duke's case and the Duchess of Sussex in their private affairs against Associated Newspaper, the publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After a negotiation between the two soccer wives failed, those who know the dramatizers in court expect to be held.
“ If you felt that the Master Game was playing, don’t underestimate the coming war of the soccer wives, ” said one authority.
"Now it's real war, Coleen doesn't give up, nor Becky nor does it get emotional."
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used Rebekah Vardy's Instagram had leaked up her stories to a newspaper.
She was named "Wagatha Christie" after explaining how she spent five months gradually limiting the number of friends who could see updates on her Instagram stories, until only Vardy's account was left.
Coleen says that he put a false story on Instagram, which had since appeared in a gossip magazine.
Vardy, who refuses the case, argues that she was taken into the lead after Mr. Rooney published the charges “with the premise, with the aim of causing great damage and intense suffering. ”
The attorneys of Coleen have questioned these words, saying that claims of her suffering are only presented to the media and have given attention to the facts of the matter.
One authority said: “The documents from Becky are misleading, this is all fabrication. ”
It's lawyer Paul Lunt of Brabner's law firm in Liverpool, which has a four-son case with former champion of England, Wayne Rooney.
Vardy's at Kingsley Napley's law firm in London, I don't know if she's hired a lawyer yet.
A spokesman for Coleen Rooney refused to interview.
Biden's crew deny the "Fox News Sunday" interview one week after Chris Wallace's interview with Trump
During Trump's interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump doubted that the future presidential candidate of Democrat Joe Biden would handle the flood of questions Wallace dropped on Trump.
We may never be able to answer that question — at least for now.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audience that Biden’s campaign team told Fox News that he was “not available ” for an interview.
“ In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent of the Democrat class, Joe Biden, would plow in a similar situation, ” said Wallace.
“ This week we asked Biden’s campaign team for an interview, and they said the former vice president wasn't available. ”
“ We keep asking each week, ” he added.
Trump's team has been studying Biden for months to avoid campaigns and press conferences while attending interviews while the crown virus epidemic rages.
Although Biden has recently begun his campaign trip again, Trump and his associates have continued to mock the ex - president for “ruining up ” at their home in Delaware.
However, in order to meet an official event, Biden’s current research has not been damaged, showing that Trump has a good advantage in both national and major combat countries.
The average Real Clear Polices indicate that the president was 7 percent under Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four states in 2016 when he turned them over to the Republican Party when he won the White House fight.
In the recent survey of Fox News Poll, Biden has a head start in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, outside the margin of a yacht in all cases.
Research also suggests that Biden has a slightly superior advantage in Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona, three other important states of conflict in these elections.
And studies indicate that governments that were once stable for the Republicans, such as Texas and Georgia, are now divided between the ex - vice president Trumps and the former vice president.
The presidential election with a sitting president volunteering for another elected period in the White House is often a vote for that president — and that seems to be the case now in 2020 in the battle between Trumps and Bidens.
The most prominent issues have been the crown virus and the economy in the epidemic — and performance and history of the president in both cases.
Kanye West and His Coping With bipolar disorder
MUSlCIAN Knye West prayed today for his wife, Kim Kardashian, to apologize for the comments he made to fit in a manic manner.
The head of mental - health help believes that he is getting his creative powers into bipolar disorder, but the mental - health professional says it is important that people take medications to control the disease.
The rapper Kanye West is not just one of the most basic and influential musicians of his day, but he is no less famous as the husband of reality star Kim Kardashian.
Much of his personal life has been performed openly.
It was of great interest when he announced earlier this month that he was volunteering for president of the United States, giving an emotional and undisputed speech.
Later, a few strange things came out of him at Twitter, claiming, among other things, that his wife was trying to get him hospitalized.
Kim Kardashian later published a declaration of Instagram, asking people to understand their husband and family; he had bipolar disorder, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want to help himself.
Since then, he has made a public apology for her.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people have bipolar disorders.
Ferdinand Jonsson, head of a mental - health team at a hospital in London, is well aware of the illness.
“ This disease can cause so much distress for the individuals and especially the families and their loved ones.
This manic or mania can destroy relationships and employment and cause intense grief.
And then the other side, depression, it's often dangerous, because there's a high suicide rate in that group.
So I loved the way she said that.
And it's only human and human, says Ferdinand.
The husband of mental - health counselor Hakisteinson himself has had bipolar disorders — and he is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very successful imagination.
If we're four stranded earth-bound kontrabasss, he's a hundred strings of a heavenly harp.
And he's so overly creative, overly powerful, and clearly in his powerful bonding thought, because you're aware of this bonding thought that we've been given to try to get into a manic state so well-known."
Kanye West won't take antipsychotics, because he thinks they're weakening his creativity.
He's been talking about the bipolar disorder, including the album Ye.
The dog says it's his choice not to take medicine.
“ Many people feel that it is the beginning of this creative elation that involves this impenetrable thought and the oversimplification of the fire he has, but then the natural flaws of it are often very painful, and the valleys of waves and the dark cellars and darkness. ”
Ferdinand, however, says it is important that patients with bipolar disorder be treated.
“ If you have a lot of mania or a personia, you’re not making great things, you're just on your side.
And like when people get seriously depressed, people are totally paralyzed by their condition," he says.
So you'd advise Kanye West to take medicine?
“ Most certainly, ” said Ferdinand.
“ And especially working with someone to find the right dose, and this means that the medication is balanced between helping him the most and destroying him and his abilities and his creative powers. ”

Delhi Metro crosses the first of the fourth-grade pillars
Delhi Metro reached an important stage of a fourth stage of action when the first pillar was cast by the route between Janakpur West and R K Ashram Marg, which is being submitted, says the employees on Sunday.
The pillar was thrown into Keshop, and on Saturday night, it had an elevated part between Keshop and Mucarba Chowk.
“ Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) took another important step in the fourth stage of the project, as the first pillar at this stage of the expansion of the train system was pushed by the way between Janakpuri West and R K KAshram Marm, ” declared the DMRC.
In spite of the severe lack of labor and other organizational challenges caused by the pandemic, the “an important phase ” was reached, according to employees.
The average height of the pillars on this route is 10 meters.
On the other hand, the pillars will be 20 meters above Madhuban Chowk, where the route overlaps at 1 and 25 meters at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the road arrives.
At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the bridge road will be 28 feet [28 m] high, which is the height of Dehli Metro’s history, according to the declaration.
The highest point of the train system is that of Dhaula Kuan, where a 13 - foot - wide [23.6 m] bridge road is reached.
In the context of architecture, pillars are vertical, efficient designs that support the close end of two pathways.
They form vertical monuments that carry up the elevated bridge path of the train system.
These railway pillars can be seen on the countless major tracks that lie under the trains in Deli.
The number of pillars now plays an important role as a landmark for addresses in the Deli-largest city area.
The 28.92 km long distance from Janakpur West to R K Ahsram Marmán is growing on the Magenta Road, which will be 22 stations.
2.18 miles off the way will be raised and 7.74 miles will be underground.

On July 17, work in the underground part of the road began at the construction of a concrete wall at the Kishna Park Extension train station.
On June 24, the DMC began to roll up an U-method that would later be placed in the elevated part of the route.
At the fourth stage of the project, 61,679 km of the new train tracks will be placed on three different routes by 45 train stations.
These new items will offer connections between the section of the train system already active by Delhi Metro.
There are 22.35 miles underground, while other parts are rising.

An ambassador for mental illness wanted a gun, an armored car, and a stab vest - said the officers were ambassadors for “the deep state. ”
The politically appointed ambassador of the United States here, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is said to want to carry a firearm on him in the CBS news today.
Starting with CBS: “Despite being located in one of the world’s safest states, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is“ incorruption, ” for his safety since he arrived in Reykjavík last year. ”
Refers to CBS in 12 diplomata, a diplomat, and former agents as well as individuals who know the matter.
Guntner’s conclusion was to demand that the U.S. Department of State request permission for the ambassador of paranoia pass through armed land.
He should also have requested a armored car that traveled between parts of Iceland and an injection vest.
The U.S. Department of State refused to comment on any kind of threat to the security of the ambassador, but representatives of the U.S. government said that the ambassador was told that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
Yet, the U.S. bodyguards in the Icelandic press would have been advertised, and if they were to become part of the ambassador’s demand.
According to a report by CBS, the Icelandic State Department did not want to comment on the matter with CBS.
However, the U.S. news agency has left its sources in this country that there has been no wish for the local government.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of walking around armed with guns that would offend the boarding state, Iceland.
The ambassador was rewarded with a large reward for supporting Donald Trump's campaign fund in the 2016 presidential election.
He used to be a dermatologist in California.
Since Gunter’s arrival in Mai, he said that he created a “inconceivable” work environment in the embassy and has already had seven members, called the Depty Chief of Mission, under the ambassador’s agents, who are also released diplomats.
All of them tested diplomats from the U.S. State Department.
The first one was sent away by the ambassador, “because he did not see his appearance. ”
Had already seen preparation for a year and a lesson in Icelandic.
The next one lasted only six months.
Afterward, rooting of staff was created, and the thought of making Gunter try out as much as most people would until he saw one of them.
Furthermore, CBS reports that Gunter was expecting employees of the embassy to walk in the fields of the “deep state ” and to have undermined him against the Washington D.C. State Department.
Ministers of the State Department of D.C. are said to be well aware of the situation in their embassy in Reykjavík, but they have been reluctant to act on the lack of control in view of the connection between Gunners and the White House.
It is also reported that Gunter had difficulty following orders from the State Department in Washington, and he is said to have refused to return to D.C. while the Covid-19 epidemic was raging.
He left the embassy in the hands of his employees for several months.
When he claims to have planned to work from his home in California except by the Secretary of State himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Finally turned back
Had at last received the command, Mr. Gunter turned back to Iceland in May.
His new subordinate, Michelle Yerkin, arrived this month.
CBS has not received answers to their inquiry to the U.S. State Department.
The State Department would not comment on CBS, nor on DV's inquiry.
Gunter is one of the many political ambassadors appointed by Trump, who have noted unusual behavior during the past few months.
For example, Woody Johnson developed a severe reaction when he came in the day that he was trying to have the British open-label Masters' tournament at a golf court owned by Trump.
The ambassador in South Africa has also been instructed to fire his two men and then tried to appoint her son for the job.
Forty-two percent of the U.S. ambassadors are politically appointed.
Thirty percent were politically appointed in Obama government, and 32% in the George W. Bush government.
The Protestants and police in high school in Seattle... because of Trump's plan to send in a squadron of federal agents...
The Seattle police used flash bombs and pepper sprays on Protestants who set fire to work tires at youth prison on Saturday, following an angry mob among the public on account of President Donald Trump's plans to send FBI troops into major cities.
Repeated bombings blew through the streets of Seattle, Washington, and smoke came from the place where Protestants had been carrying their bicycles at a construction site at the juvenile prison.
The Protestants cut their cars and smashed windows in tires.
The riot police opposed Protestants, some carrying umbrellas to protect themselves from the bronchi that rained over them.
The Seattle Times reports that 16 were arrested on suspicion of assault on police officers, for preventing police work, or for refusing to leave the area.
Poland will tell you about the European Convention on Prevention of Violence Against Women
Poland’s right government says that the country will withdraw from the European Convention for the prevention of violence against women.
The Indonesian Convention is the first binding legalist in the world who has the goal of preventing violence against women, while Poland’s Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro describes the text as “inculcable ” as he requires that schools teach children about sex from social perspectives.
Zibro said this weekend that on Monday he would begin preparing a formal procedure for the country to tell him about the contract.
“ This ideological factor is related to attempts to alter education in schools and leisure activities, as regards learning, attitudes and conviction of a young generation of Polishs, based on the conclusion that our belief is wrong, that biological sex is old - fashioned, and that everything is really about socialist sex. ”
Zibro believes that the agreement for education between children and young people as well as family relationships in the context of LGBTs are unacceptable.
“ We also reject the LGBT program in our discussion of family ties, because this is an opinion held by the left acquisitions or groups of homosexuals who want their views to become binding laws, ” he said.
On Sunday, the European Council said that it was “consuming ” because Poland was now returning from the contract.
In Warsaw, we protested on Friday about 2,000 people, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, except the office of the Ordo Luris, who support the country’s reporting of the contract.
“ We won’t get victims, ” they called.
Objections were also held in other cities in Poland.
In December 2012, Poland signed the Istanbul Convention to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence and validated it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, a carpenter at the Pagirs Palace, died at 81 years of age
KANS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, part of a quarter - mile - race empire that includes his father Lee and his brother Richard, who was the first motor developer taken into the Nascar Palace, died on Saturday afternoon.
He was 81 years old.
Pitty's family didn't give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While other members of his family were rowed for their talent behind the wheel, Maurice Petty won the nickname "The Boss" for his talent with the wrench.
He helped his family win 198 races and seven titles in the elite unit of NASCAR, and also built machines that assured the Heiurshall Association Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton.
“ The director was one of the best mechanics in the history of NASCAR, ” said the chairman and manager Jim France.
“ He brought in the power that helped Petty Enterprises to get his superiors at the sporting stage.
Even though Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also took various roles behind the scenes and did what he needed to get his cars to win the race."
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939, in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father to the racetrack when he was little, and his knowledge of the engine activation soon became an important part of the victory for the countries of Lee Petty in 54 races and three championships.
He raced 26 times in the NASCAR Cup in 1960–64, was seven times the top five seats, and 16 times the top ten.
However, he soon decided to focus on what happens under the hood rather than behind the wheel, which proved to be a charm for his older brother, who relied on his machine during his triumphal march.
Richard, who was then called the "The Boy", won the first championship along with the Boss in 1964 with the Plymouth Rif.
They returned 1967, followed by two consecutive years in 1970 and 1971, reaching three more titles before the end of the 1970 ’ s.
With these seven titles on their backs, they share the highest number of titles for Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“ Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and was involved in his career at Petty Enterprises helping build one of the top teams in NASCAR," said Winston Kelley in a document.
“ Even though Petty’s victory is recorded as 212, he has a claim well above 250 victories, taken with all the machines he built for his rivals.
The boss will be remembered forever as the best mechanic in the history of NASCAR."
Lee Petty died in 2000, and in 2014, Maurice Petty’s wife, Patricia, died.
He was also the cousin of the former car driver and mediaman Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, the head of the truck race.
“ Although we now greet Maurice Petty, one of the true and effective pioneers and the heroes of the NASCAR, his legacy and name will be stored in our memories, held up and preserved forever, ” said Kelley.
"We've sent our deepest sympathies to the Petty family."

Good cholesterol, also called a high density lipoprotein, stores “bad” cholesterol – a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart – and transports it to the liver.
The cholesterol (low density lipoprotein) is broken down in the liver and then eliminated from the body.
However, the new study does not examine the dose or type of chocolate that is consumed.
Whether participants ate dark chocolate, chocolate chocolate chocolate, or other chocolate candy is not clear.
The results were based on an earlier study that concluded that the use of cocoa (in chocolate) reduced the risk of heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoide, found in chocolate, lowers blood pressure and improves vascular function.
Using blood vessels, it refers to how well blood distributes oxygen and nutrients throughout the body and removes waste products.
The results of the new study were not mentioned for lifestyle factors.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the evidence that those who had accepted the eating of chocolate were more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and experience less stress.
“ Each of these factors could have an independent effect on cardiovascular health, ” she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys with books on a new collection campaign
Ronson said, “We have really listened, and that was the key to our project. ”
“ We don’t believe that people want to recycle the books — we think they're gonna want them, but they can be recycled if they want to. ”
Ronson said that the new campaign has been in progress long before the VID-19 and despite the epidemic, she believes that the timing of the new campaign was “good ” because of how much time parents now spend with their children.
Researchers have expressed concern that consumers have become tired of the constant toy campaigns of the largest markets, but Ronson says that there is no sign of fatigue at this time.
“ We haven’t seen anything like this yet, but we keep our eyes open for this constantly, ” she said.
“ We study very much data from week to week, month to month, to make sure that what we put away is in harmony with our customers.
It was Cloes who paved the way for collection campaigns such as Little Shop, Australia, but the first in my year 2018 was the drive behind the best quarter - sales market ever.
Woolworths followed along with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the supermarket to expand its sales, and now last offers the environmental presentation campaign Discovery Gardens for free plants and plants for planting.
However, the new collection campaign could have a smaller impact this time, as UBS analysers predict an increase in sales in the large Australian markets during the largest part of the 2021 financial year.
Ronson said that customers can expect a more diverse collection campaign in the future and that such campaigns as Little Shop are likely to be less common.
“ There is a lot about collection campaigns around the world that we look at, and we constantly seek inspiration from other countries, ” she said.
“ We have to do it to make sure that we do more and more fully with our customers. ”
Been going five laps around the country this summer
The photographer and producer John Ragnar Jonsson, known as Jon From Iceland, have been more and less known to Iceland since the pandemic.
John completed his business course at the University of Brooklyn a few years ago, but he now works on traveling and producing markets for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early at John’s, or in April, when he traveled throughout the West and stayed in his car.
From a year to year, he has gone about five or six laps around the country.
Besides, he's been on countless day trips here and there.
What journey has been made?
“ For someone like me who always has a wreck and has seen everything, it’s hard to name a favorite place.
More of the weather and the association that really matter.
After opening roads in June, many have recently traveled to highlands.
They always get out of the way because it's such a fairy tale to get to your destination.
The last trip was possibly the favorite trip of the year, when 25 of us went up by Riverside to Lake Elf."
What's ahead of you this summer?
“ It’s a lot of excitement for me in the near future, but I was finishing my DIVE scuba course and now taking on diving trips here and there in Iceland.
And then I was adding surfboards to my "sleepbox", so I'll be out in the water more than before.
I'm heading for a 10-day "solo" trip with everything I need my back, but it'll show up later in the summer where I'm going.
If I don't, I'm going to be a lot of highlands in the near future, where you can't look at that area all year."
What place in Iceland is your favorite place?
“ It’s always hard to choose one place, but the glacier has been a part of my life since I can remember.
My family and I went to every summer in a cabin at the foot of the Bredinian glacier, and since then I have always felt comfortable in that area.
I think it's safe to say that I've been there over 100 times."
With what place in Iceland do you recommend visiting?
“ I’m going to bring one pearl from every part of the country, which is: Mullaburs in the South, Coalition of the East, Adola Falls in the North, Red Sea on the West, Snæfell Snæfell Snland, and last but not the last...
What is essential during the journey?
“ I don’t go out on land unless I have these things in my car: a good flashlight, a hammock, a lopa, a hunting knife, an eagle, a cooler, and a hot tub... those who know me about what I’m talking about. ”
Searching for 24 roulers afraid they drowned from an island in Malaysia
KUAL LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) The Malaysia authorities said on Sunday that 25 local refugees who are afraid of drowning after jumping off a boat from Longkawi, north of Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdulah, a high - ranking official at the Malaysia National Clinic, said that the first information from the police showed that only one of the 25 had jumped off the boat had been able to swim to land.
The man who survived sought police assistance late Saturday and has been detained for further study, says Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim roses have fled Myanmar because of military operations, and many of them live in an overcrowded refugee camp in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the people of Malaysia, who have been the regular destination of a boat party promising refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and airships were used in the search.
He said that the National Guard also remembers to help sailors in the region and neighboring authorities in Thailand to help them find their way.
He didn't give any more information about the boat.
For the past month, the authorities in Malaysia took 269 swingers into custody and found bodies on board a boat suspected of being smuggled off the coasts of Langkawi, who said that he was deliberately damaged so that he could not return to sea.
Malasia’s National Guard later said that the 269 individuals were taken from a larger ship with dozens of people who are believed to have died and their bodies thrown into the water.
The prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that Malaysian could not accept any more hooligans, where it deals with economic degradation because of the crown virus epidemic.
However, he said that those in the land already would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, there are more than 2 million illegal immigrants and some 180,000 refugees and clients — including 101,000 roses — registered at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
The residents of Aswan collect, watch and return a shipment of chocolate to Sudan by car lift
The transportbill is en route to Sudan with tons of chocolate rolled on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the roadside at the village of Wadi Carkar, when the driver fell into a coma due to heat stress.
The townspeople flocked to help the driver, where he lay and to save the goods that had been eaten.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, expressed his position, so that the driver “was on his way past our village; we couldn’t just stand by.
We're supposed to help people in distress, no matter where they come from."
He added that the villagers came to an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to rescue the truck’s cargo, estimated from three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahhr said that the villagers have been at the scene from morning till evening and saved as much of the cargo as they could.
“ What we considered most important was to save the driver’s life, protect the cargo, and open the international road again, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide water and shelter to the injured driver, told Bahr, and added that they just wanted to make sure that he could get to and from the village safely.
There were already wreckers at the council, and the crown virus could make them worse.
“ The world epidemic alone is called upon to be our elected representative of the leadership and vision that we expect in times of trouble, ” says a report prepared by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communication studies at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert on organizational development and management.
“ But we are also confronted with another debt involving the inherited sin of our nation and the racial imbalance that has plagued our country since its establishment. ”
The study reviews a familiar source of authority in front of the body’s pathetic condition: the lack of real linking between classes, a program limiting the opportunity to communicate, overcoherence of power in frontal places, constant demands of funds, teamwork statistics, negative impacts of the media that are operating around the 24 hours, the fact that the most important elections for members of Congress are often premeditated and finally procurators of minorities.
It also warns that the assembly moves more to the Internet because of the pandemic, where such a system, which allows elections with the help of surrogates in the council without the congressing to travel to Washington, could still add to existing problems.
If the idea of a remote conference is established, it would be a serious setback for attempts to increase communication between groups, according to the report.
“ The world epidemic was forced to move most people to the Internet, and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
“ Even though it was necessary, such things should not be interpreted as virtue. ”
The document says that the council needs “more than less contact between members of the Parliament, face to face. ”
They need to learn more about one another's district, have polite conversation to find common surfaces, and build a bond based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
The request for civility particularly applied this week, when Ted Yoho, a member of the Rebubikana of Florida, attacked Alexandru Ocasio-Cortez, a representative of the Democrats of New York City, and his fellow members of the Rebublika class took up to attack Liz Cheney, a member of Repullana in Wyoming with hostile words.
Senator Val Demings is discussing the Presidency, making Trump hear it for graces
The Senator Val Demings (demokratar, Florida) was not shy about discussing her interest in serving a vice president in the potential government of Joe Biden and expressing sincere appreciation for being taken into account for the office.
This respected member of a black party was interviewed by Black PressUSA lively by the #FIYAH! Live Shower and related his story, energy and commitment that has put her in a place she is today, starting with the words “You all know my story. I grew up as the daughter of a maid and janitor in Jacksonville, Florida. ”
Demings was one of the four presidents of the council at the trial of Donald Trump in the Senate in January.
No matter whether the Senate justifys Trump, it will be recorded in history that he is the fourth president accused.
In an interview with NPR from his office at Capitol Hill, the former vice president of the council was quoted as saying: “Was it worth every day?
She added that despite the disappointment of the decision, democracies had been obliged to follow the case, regardless of its outcome.
During the interview, Demings made it clear that she was opposed to Trump in Roger Stone’s prison sentence, which was condemned for lying before the council (increased other crimes) as well as his grace for other criminals who were convicted of similar crimes, saying, “The cowardly grace of your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover over your trespasses. ”
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden's list of possible vice presidents, who also contain Karen Bass for CBC's chairman (demokratar, California), Stacey Abrams former Georgian congressman, members of Kamalka Harris (demokrat, California), and Tammy Duckworth (demokratar, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms mayor Atlanta, Susan Rice, U.S.A.A., and some others.
She noted, however, that only one person would decide who volunteered for Joe Biden in the fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she moved her hand to her mouth while she laughed and pretended to be whispering to those who watched the live broadcast, adding, “If you want to call me, you can call me for my sake. ”
There is no doubt that, no matter what the political views of each person are, history books view this period as a time when evolution took place in American politics and attitudes.
Demings didn't miss it.
She mentioned how many women would be eligible for the U.S. vice president's offer is an opportunity to break through the rest of the “glass roof ” — especially for women of African origin.
“ It’s exactly these opportunities that I work so hard all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money, or that they are of the wrong sex, ” she said.
The senator planned to ensure that the Democratic Committee and Biden's campaign team would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to make as many people vote as possible.
“ I will call Tom Perez (former of the Democrat Committee) and I will put this at the top of my list," promised Demings.
She agreed that this had to happen now rather than later in the campaign.
When she answered the words of former foreign minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost the election, and another editorial that says that the president is preparing to get himself alive, came to life over Demings, saying, “To the extent of the suggestion to get himself turned on, it made me feel bad. ”
“ But who would ever do it except Trump?
I think he hates this job.
There is no way to get away with breaking laws and ignoring the Constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he can't stand losing.
I can quite believe that the president will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those people who make it happen."

Aliba and Jack Ma headed for trial in Guugram for the charges of the former employee
Guugram, July 26, stated: The Aliba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been called to the right in Guurgam, after the former employee of the company claimed that he had been fired for protesting censorship and false reports in the company’s programs.
The case is taken into account in the Georgian Court of Guurgam and the personal court judge Sonia Sheokand has set out a course for Alibba, Jack Ma, and over 10 others and asked them to appear in court on July 29th, according to the report.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who served at UC Web's office in Guugram to October 2017, requested 268,000 U.S. dollars in damages according to court documents.
“ We stick to the company’s commitments to the Indian market and the welfare of its employees, and its policies are in accordance with local laws.
We can't comment on current lawsuits," said UC India in a statement.
“ There is also a list of sensitive words ” that contains a password for the Hindu and English, such as the “land of India and China ” and“ the war between China and India, ” which is held in the charge that UC Web uses censoring material on its systems in India, ” says Reuters.
Last month, the Ministry of Internal Affairs banned 59 Chinese cell phones, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with an increase in tension between the two countries.
A New York City fireman says that it is “almost acceptable ” to release a white fireman from a price of honor.
A New York City firefighter who deals with issues of diversity says it is “almost acceptable ” to keep a white fireman from a honorary price so that the flag bears can all be black, according to a recent report.
White fireman Daniel McWilliams has been sued for discrimination due to race after being taken from a flag carrier to a memorial service in November 2017 to remember the dead members of the Vulcan Company, a brotherhood of black firemen.
In addition, the chief representative of the fire department in the field of diversity and bioavailability, lawyer Cecilia Loving, defended the decision in the hearing of the New York State Department of Human Rights, according to the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters of the department seen in a historic motion lift of the American flag at Ground Zero during the days following the attack of September 11.
According to dear McWilliams, the fire department had chosen him to be alone with the flag bearers at the memorial service.
Being flagrant during this ceremony was “a great honor and privilege ” for McWilliams, according to CNN’s legal application.
When he arrived at the ceremony, however, he was prevented from participating in the honorary price of the then president of the Vulcan Company, Regina Wilson, for the claim she had asked that all flag bearers at the Mass be black.
She then asked McWilliams — a 29-year-old firefighter for New York City — to help in another way."
Among the claims she had asked him to do is to escort civilians and set uniform firemen away from the Mass.
McWilliams insists that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the honor price because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was, he said.
Wilson, who has served at the New York City Fire Department for 21 years and who also participated in the rescue work on September 11, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the Vulcan Company members.
McWilliams claims that he left the memorial service “to spare himself further shame, humiliation, and shame," when friends and colleagues heard what went between them, according to New York Daily News.
When Loving, a black witness in court, asked a lawyer named McWilliams, Keith Sullivan, as follows: “So asking that everyone be black at a price of honor is not discrimination?"
“ No, it's not," said the New York Post of Loving.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it was okay to ask that all of them be black at an honorary price, which she replied, “By all means. ”
Loving explained that it would be okay to replace a white person with a black person, “to develop our unique backgrounds and our backgrounds to create pride, unity, and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first filed charges of discrimination on race by New York Fireman in January 2018.
He then filed a case against Wilson, New York City Fireman, New York City and undesirable individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams filed his charges, his supporters had avenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid his hands on McWilliams and said: “I have heard about you, they told me you would act like this, and now you know who I am."
In an excerpt, Sullivan wrote that it would have been “wonderly ” to exclude McWilliams from the honorary price at the Mass and to indicate that one thing would not apply to all of the fire department.
“ If you are a black person and a white person discriminating against you at work, ” said Sullivan.
Wilson was given “supervising for one hour ” as a result of her treatment at McWilliams.
In the meantime, a white person who discriminates against a black person receives “great punishment ” wrote Sullivan.
“ The New York City fire wish has created a policy and process designed to please members of the Vulcan Society, who behave in a racist manner, excuse their actions, and help them... and this has to be stopped, ” wrote Sullivan too.
Frustrated by a pedestrian and demanded money
One of them was arrested in the city center after an attempted robbery, where he threatened a walking passenger and tried to get money from the person.
The man was saved in a prison cell.
Then police were informed of a man with a knife downtown.
The knife was confiscated, and the report was taken from the person.
More than 80 cases came into the police table in the capital area from 17 to 05, and this morning six were saved in a cell.
The police stopped, among other things, a driver who pulled a trailer in Kjalarnes, where the trailers were in very bad condition.
The trailer was held still and intended to supply a transport device to transport it into town.
That's when police stopped the production of drugs in New Year's.
Two were arrested for the matter, and they were released after the announcement.
There was also an announcement of individuals who shot up fireworks in the river town.
Had they escaped the scene when police arrived, “probably know the shame, since it is still quite long at the end of the year. ”
Thousands of Khabarovs still demand Putin's resignation
Thousands of citizens in the Russian city of Khabarovsk last night protested the arrest of the governor in the same province of East Russia and its successors, who have never lived in the province.
The former governor, Sergei Furgal, is very popular, and tens of thousands of people protested when he was arrested and taken into custody in Moscow earlier this month, accused of having ordered the murder of three businessmen 15 years ago.
During the recent week, Furgal was formally deputized as governor and his 39 - year - old party brother Mikhail Degtyarev, appointed in his place, with little interest in the locals.
When Degtaryev said that he was inexperienced and, worse still, with no connection with Khabarovsk, the inhabitants called for his resignation.
The calls have been ignored by Degtaryev.
The Protestants last night were small fewer than the first protesters, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the requirements were the same as before: liberation of Furgals and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president.
“ We want the governor to be released, because we believe that his arrest is highly illegal, ” reports the AFP News agency after a semi-rithmetic Protestant, Alina Slepovu.
She claims that the Kremlin agents had Furgal arrested “to protect their own interests, not the interests of the province. ”
The Khabarovsk Police left Protestants uninjured, despite a direct violation of the Cronian plague’s premium for current meeting bans.
In Moscow, however, police arrested at least ten people who met at the Pusjkin Square to show their support to Protestants in Khabarovsk, says the report of British Britain’s Guardian.
Furgals, Russia's Freely Disputed Democrat Party, is a series of hard-line Nationalist groups, and is considered by politicians to be fairly loyal to the Kremlin government in most cases.
However, the same political commentators inform the BBC that the victory of Furgals in the governorial elections two years ago — great and clear — was quite a shock to Putin and United Russia, although it suggests that the control of the Kremlin in the eastern region was getting sick.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he is awaiting trial.
He is charged with making three murders between 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were dead; and the third went through the midst of the wilderness.
Sarah Rinsford, a city correspondent in Moscow, says that the followers of Furgals, who are very popular at home, are convinced that the charges and arrests are politically rooted.
They want to know why the government had to arrest him until now, says Rainford, 15 years after his alleged offense.
Decades came when the hurricane Hanna rode over South Texas.
When the hurricane hit the southern Texas coast on Saturday, July 25, U.S.A., it fell into the strength of a tropical storm, but the government warned that the storm could still cause a flood of human life.
The U.S. Weather Office said that great rains are the biggest threat in southern Texas and northeast of Mexico as the storm moved west-southwest on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this video during Twitter and told storyfal that he had taken it outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
Homeless women with disability are involved in the COVID-19 fight in Chenani
Shanthi, a disabled woman educated as a tailor, visits 250 homes each day to identify people with symptoms in the Kadam Bank, a large Covid field in Chennai, where about 10,000 cases have been identified.
It starts early at 7:30 a.m., and ends at approximately 16.
It measures the heat of people, asks about symptoms, and informs them of the importance of wearing masks, washing their hands regularly, and keeping away from others.
In fact, her work has led to early detection and treatment of infectious diseases in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 members of Chenai City who care for their home chores, but not health care professionals.
The task, according to the government, has contributed to a 50 percent reduction in positive cases, in the daily count of Chenai, while the number of these is increasing in other parts of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says that not all members are cooperating.
She adds: “Most people are cooperative when a woman with disability approaches them.
Some, though, become frustrated.
This, however, is not to worry about.
I think people should be safe.
When I come back the next day, people are polite.
It helps build a good relationship."
And there are other women like Shanthi who stay in the city's bedhouse for women with disability and fight the Covid-19 team.
Not far from Kedam’s Kavith, also disabled, has also participated in the campaign as an overseer.
Despite having a specially designed bicycle, Captain goes walking toward people and holds his crutches.
“ I’m happy, ” she says about the reduction in the number of infections, but she adds: “I want to see them go down to maybe about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can get it."
On the first floor of the bedroom where the two live, Matilda Fuuceca, a basketball woman using a wheelchair, and Manimedalai, is a teacher, and they send all the information that comes from about 40 women into Chennai's website.
Matilda says she doesn't fear being infected with the crown virus.
“ When we help others, God protects us, ” she adds.
When asked what steps it takes, Manimicalai says: “I wear a mask, hold a distance, and wash my hands often.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a siddha drink that promotes the immune system."
A few months ago, when the crown virus first arrived in Chenai, these disabled women spent their time and abilities sewing masks for health care professionals in the city.
Aishwarya Rao and the head of the nursing station, as well as the Dorcas Research Centre, who drives a cloud, says: “They adapt to the needs of every moment.
Once, masks were missing, and they did not leave behind.
Now it's time for community intervention, and then they answered the call."
Cronovirus transmission in Tamil Nadu has become 200,000 after 6989 new cases in the preceding 24 hours, but it is also the largest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty-nine have died and 7758 have recovered in the past day.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206,737.
Police are trying to get to a teenager's last trip in Helensburgh
Detectives who study the death of a teenage boy in Helensburgh are now trying to put together a time line over his last trips.
The body of 19 - year - old Kirk Allan was found at a home in Johnson Court about 06:25 on Saturday.
A 30 - year - old man was arrested, and the police confirmed on Sunday that he had been accused of death.
He'll be in court in Dumbarton on Monday.
Police chief Steve Martin said: “Our mind is with Kirk’s family and friends during these difficult times.
Police will continue working with society and will support it.
Our research remains focused on getting a full picture of what happened, especially Kirk's trips during the last days before his death, but we're not looking for anyone else in relation to his death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report their survival of discrimination
During the last few weeks, it has become clear that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racism in South Africa.
Upbuilding conversations must take place, and action must be taken to make everyone welcome in sports.
Aswell Prince, a former cricket star at Proteas, gave it to his former white teammates and accused them of racial prejudice by saying he and other black men were “rotors. ”
Prince said that the official black laity of Proteas has been named “royists ” of their white teammates.
He added that it was sad that even though black players like Makhaya Ntini and now Kagino Rabada were able to get the top talk in the sport, some people still associated with their quota talk.
Prince, who is now the coach of Cape Cobras, had these comments dropped at the United Coalition for Sports and Community Organizations (UCSCBO) meeting on Thursday nights.
The aim of the United Nations is to continue the fiery discussion of historical racial discrimination in South African sports.
“ As I said when I’m relieved of social media, it’s not my intention to come and drag people’s names down to the lake, but these are real incidents...
"You do everything right, but you still get it"
Paul Roberts, a former musician and carpenter who became a developer at NASA, now works for a software company.
He and his wife, a former nurse at Methodist, who consider himself an optimist, held out an online amateur magazine and attended Comic Con events earlier in years.
Once a week, they will be polished with their two daughters, their son-in-law, and their 7-year-old grandchild and play wild Uno games.
“ They’re amazing nerds, ” says 38 - year - old Roman, about their parents.
Sheryl Roberts, aged 65, is aware of the dangers of the pandemic — she has diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put her at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a support device that previously keeps a blocked coronary artery open.
“ We have been so careful, very careful, and stay away from people, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began working from home in the spring, when the epidemic fought hard in the state of Washington, New York, and other parts of the country.
Paul has occasionally gone to the supermarket in “old times, ” and their only real date in the past few months was, according to Sheryl, when they began looking through the window.
Their younger daughter was also careful.
But then she returned home from work one day in mid - June and felt that she was allergic.
Soon she had cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all the sense of taste and smell, which are typical symptoms of the crown virus.
“ She said, ‘ I don’t know what's going on, Mom, but I was wearing a mask, wearing gloves, washing my hands, ’ said Sheryl.
“ You do everything right, but you still catch it. ”
Elaine Roberts, diagnosed with a positive crown virus, did not become seriously ill.
But the situation was much worse for her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife began to sneeze and then cough, just as their daughter did, and then they started to have a fever and a lot of pain in the body.
Then he became “soundly ill, awful soon, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he became confused.
Concernedly, she checked his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency reception, the second time in two days.
The former royal couple thought it was "hidden" in the Queen's Christmas talk, according to a new book
IN HIS Christmas speech, British King MEGHAN Markle and Harry were found by his grandmother, Queen of Britain.
The couple’s new life story, “Finding Freedom, ” reveals that they were overlooked in the museums that could be seen in the Christmas talk.
Pictures on the desk that the queen was sitting with showed, among other things, Prince William, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla as well as Prince Philip.
But Meghan and Harry were nowhere to see that Archie had been born in May, yet the boy was referred to as her Majesty’s “diffy grandchild. ”
The new book published in August also shows that Meghan and Kate Middleton “were never friends, ” since they“ found it difficult to get over superficial courtesy ” and met only a few times.
Last night, it was claimed that Harry and his brother Villam began some years before his relationship with Meghan, but it reached its climax because of Villam and Kate Middleton's marriage.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was “an alarm ” on events with his brother and Kate Middleton, claiming that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came along. ”
The members of the Islamic Party accuse labor leaders of wanting to keep public employees “a world forever. ”
The members of the Islamic Party accuse labor leaders of wanting public workers to be “rescue forever, ” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson's plea that people return to work.
After protesting Boris Johnson’s appeal to the people to return to work, military officers were accused of wanting to “speak at home forever. ”
The members of the House were angry when government and public workers were told to resist the pressure of their officers to return to their workplace.
Former Secretary Andrew Percy said that the necessary public service, such as the release of passports, was stopped while public employees at the market had worked hard to keep the community walking in the crown virus epidemic.
“ It’s unacceptable that people refuse to return to their work while workers in warehouses and factories all over the country have continued to work so that public workers could eat while this has been done, ” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to go on vacations but cannot do so because of the people who refuse to go back to their workplace, although they are safe.
Labour officials cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever — especially now when we know that people can return to work safely."
After the prime minister’s call last week, Alex Chisholm, a newly appointed director of public service, announced that the Ministry “returns from the office of public servants working from home, moving their return to their workplace to August 1. ”
The government and public workers ’ union told their members, who count some 200,000 people, that they did not have to comply with this requirement, and it was all about politics.
A spokesman for a government union and public employees, the largest labor union of public workers in Britain, said that the demand to return to the workplace was “not presented by the health and safety of our social workers in the first place, or to strengthen the economy.
This is done solely because of political pressure from members of the Parliament who insist that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to social partners is clear: If you do your work at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to work again, don't take it for granted."
The problem can be attributed to a growing dissatisfaction with a delayed publication of passports because staff work at home, while some 400,000 are now reported to be waiting for their application outputs.
The Ministry of the Interior has now published that there will be “early rushing ” applications from British applications because of travel in the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport release for more than four weeks.
A government and public worker union has acknowledged that some have had to wait up to 143 days for passports, but it claims that “small and often narrow offices ” make it difficult for 4,000 staff of the passport services to keep distance necessary.
Former government minister, David Davis, urged union leaders to “be reasonable ” and seek guidance in cooperation with the government in order to get people back into their workplace.
He added that if he was in the government, he would ask a labor officer: “What is it that you want? That people should be at home all summer long?"
However, many of Britain’s largest companies have similarly ignored Johnson’s recommendation to return to work.
A larger work study with a total of 400,000 employees found that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplace.
Emphasis on History Can Be a Vital Responsibilities
The gulf has changed, but understanding and reconciliation should be the goal.
The school system is partly responsible for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught in Australian history.
The fact is, without drastic action, the only lesson that especially discusses our history — “Saga Australia ” for 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in Victoria’s country completed a total of 49,324 students who completed high school, or only 1%.
During the past six years, this figure has nearly doubled by half, but nearly 100 fewer students enter the trade each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s history in 12th grade is that little has been done in previous years to arouse their interest.
History is not even a unique field of study; rather, it falls under the vaster “power of reason. ”
Hence, students in the 7th and 8th grade finish only one brief unit on “the natives and the islanders of Torres and their culture. ”
In the years 9 and 10, there is another unit in Australia during World Wars.
For many students in Victoria, all of this is what is taught about Australia’s history during high school.
Year 9 and 10 provide another optional unit for the period 1750-1918.
It is important to take three measures to save a Australian story in Victorian schools.
First, history has to become an independent subject, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is taught only as a part of science, it has little room in the study record.
It is generally taught by people who have a general education in thought science but who have not studied history.
Pathological skills, such as the analysis of information, are complex.
To make sure that such skills are taught in a practical and exciting way, we must employ more specialized history teachers.
Third, from 1788 to 1914 Australia’s history must become an obligation.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn the history of Australia in the 12th year because they would have had to learn from scratch.
Knowledge of history alone does not have a deep gulf between races.
But without it, as can be clearly seen in the Victorian study book, the project is hopeless.
Dr. Matthew Bach is a representative of liberals at the Victorian Council and former vice president of Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.
Aaron Elis in the final European seat game - Isaac split off the field in half
In the Danish football league, Aron Elis Thradarson is playing a final European game.
Isaac Bergmann Johnson played only the first half with a Northköping team against the numerator of Falkenberg, Sweden.
In Denmark, Aaron Elis was on OB’s team as the people entered the World War II World Series.
OB will meet AGF or FC Copenhagen in the final game, depending on whether the joints will get higher after the final tour of the highest Danish league later today.
Aaron Elis played the whole game in 1–1 draw at the Horses in the field today, but OB had won the first game in the home field, 3–1, so he won a total of 4-2.
Isaac served as a starting team for Norrköping, which was unexpectedly 2–0 behind the first half of his legion against Falkenberg’s legion team in the Swedish elite.
Norröping made a triple split at the beginning of the second half, and Isaac was one of those who had to step aside.
Norröping reached an even level, but Falkenberg reached 3-2 per 89. minute.
Yet, there was still time for Norköping to recover from hell at the last minute, 3-3.
Norrköping continues at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsburg, and five points ahead of Malmö, which is playing well later today.
The score was sufficient for Falkenberg to escape the bottom for a while, but the past is a ladder above Helsing City and Kalmar, a game that has a good play.
Collections of Yearly Festivals in Korean Times
Anna Liliðurðuróttir founded the Facebook team “My Nation’s Festival 2020 ” to gather documents on the national celebration that The People will celebrate next weekend.
Many people will camp in their gardens and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja had a little chat with the Whale Show.
“ There's nothing yet that's very exciting, too, because there's 600 people here, so they're clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lila.
Something's about the islanders going to have tent feasts at home.
“ Men have talked about being with their own [a festival], perhaps camping in the park and gathering their family together, as men always do at this time, ” says Anna.
“ You assume that you will spend time with your people.
However, it likely says that many people will simply not be there, “but they still have some small national festival somewhere else. ”
A national committee is now working hard to repay the purchase tickets, but Anna feels that many locals are more inclined to secure tickets for the next year’s festival.
“ Even now, people are investing in the tickets and making values for 2021. ”
“ I am a great nation festival person, I love the preparations and all around this, but sometimes something comes into life that you can’t control, and that's just how it is, ” says Anna, but, according to one word, people are saying, "can't let go of a national festival once?"
Anna Lilly claims that he did not establish himself or encourage people to celebrate their own national festival. Rather, he is moved to gather records of trade feasts in the Eylands this year.
“ What did people do during these odd times?
I'm not going to use this in one thing or anything, but there are some people who use it for something like this, but I was just creating a territory where people can put in what they're doing."
At the same time, each year a fire has been piled up on a Friscade.
“ I think many people are excited to get burned on Friday night.
The only thing that makes sense is that the forecast is no spes."
“ This fire will be on fire, but it just has to be revealed what it will be like, ” says Anna Lila.

Will Prince Andrew be mentioned in new documents of sexual misconduct?
The British royal family now prepares for dealing with possible new information in legal documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A U.S. judge has ordered that secret files on Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Included in these 80 pages are parts of Maxwell’s work of witnessing in 2016
The onset of these pages may also put great pressure on Prince Andrew, where they contain communication between Maxwell and Epstein, January 2015.
Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the monthly U.S. financer, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced to communicate with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrew is now preparing to protect himself from any possible publication of information this week with even more damaging accusations of his friendship with child molester Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.
The U.S. district judge Loretta Preska ordered this week about the release of 80 secret legal documents associated with Maxwell and Epstein, the hundreds of pages.
The development of these enormous documents would be a shock to the 58 - year - old Maxwell, where they contain a large part of her testimony to lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be a “association of questions ” about her sex history.
They could also put great pressure on Prince Andrew, whose one of the documents contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, the alleged sexual slave of the monthly American financer, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced three times to associate with Andrew.
Andrew has repeatedly and firmly rejected these claims.
E - mail since 2015, which has been leaked and published last year, seems to indicate that Andrew asked Maxwell for help in responding to Robert’s claims.
We have no doubt that the Duke will be exonerated.
There he told the chief classwoman, “Tell me when we can talk, has certain questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied, “Have information, call me when you have a second."
Last night, an authority near Andrew said: “The threat of York has not done anything wrong, so we do not worry about opening a court document.
As courts in the United States have tried to point out them, this does not mean that a charge is true, even if it is in the legal papers.
The U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to exercise extreme caution in handling charges presented in legal documents.
We totally agree with that.
We have no doubt that the Duke will be completely exonerated in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in the custody center of Manhattan, awaiting trial for finding and seducing some of Epstein’s minor victims from 1994 to 1997.
It is also accused of perjury because of refusing knowledge about his abuse.
She rejects all accusations.
Maxwell’s last talk with lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s injuries, which is now under the name Guffre, which she recorded after marriage.
About 40 pages of a total of 418 witnesses were made public last year, but following the decision of the judge Presna in New York last week, more parts could be opened first on Thursday.
The lawyers Maxwell had one week to submit appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his cell in New York last year while awaiting trial because of sexual misconduct.
Detectives are looking for a gang of criminals for violent attacks on the streets of Edinburgh
Three attacked a man in Edinburgh and caused an injury that could be permanent.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked in Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 11:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
School police reported that he had been transferred to the Royal Hospital with serious injuries.
Detective Dale Miles, director of the investigation, said: “It was a violent, unprovoked attack. ”
The suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One of them was thought to be in his 30 ’ s, about six feet [ 180 cm] tall and very tall.
He was short clippings and dark hairs in white shirts, dark pants, and dark shoes.
Detective Miles said, “I asked everyone in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious about giving themselves up."
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, secretary of the United States in Iceland, wants to carry a gun in this country, and he wants extra security.
He is said to have been “friendly ” about his safety since he arrived in the country last year.
This is stated in CBS, where it also says that this is what Gunter wants, despite his “one of the world’s safest kingdoms. ”
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. State Department to ask for a gun.
Then he's asked for a armored car and a vest that protects him from knives.
Sources of CBS say, however, that the Ministry has repeatedly announced to Gunter that he is not at risk in Iceland.
According to a report by CBS, the State Department of State has not revealed whether a request was received from the United States regarding the possible weapons of Gunter, since authorities do not comment on national security measures.
However, news agency sources say that no request has been made.
Then also, after his sources told Gunter that he should not seek to carry weapons, CBS would be taken as an insult to this country.
Gunter, an experienced dragon, has been a dermatologist in California for many years.
He is an active member of the United States Republican Party and a zealous sponsor for President Donald Trump.
He recently called attention to the country when he was calling for the “insighty China virus. ”
Sources of CBS also say that Gunter was deeply impressed by the personnel of the U.S. embassy in Reykjavík.
He's already had seven second-guest workers in the embassy from May last year.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to the “Death, ” which is supposed to be a net of American officials that work against Trump, and he resented that one carried snow into his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February before a conference and refused to return to Iceland for several months, according to CBS.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but eventually Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, had to order him to return, and he did so in May.
The home game format is a key for Jose Mourinho, which says Tottenham has easier moves in store when fans get back to the games
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur, Tottenham Hospur, who says that it would be much easier to maintain good luck at home if the viewers were allowed to play games.
Asks has won 12 world wars in this season, but lost four times — only one of the six teams above them have lost more at home.
The Portuguese trainer said that although such a triumphal march was possible without its members, it would be easier to maintain it if they were there.
“ We have to do this with the fans, ” he said, “and without them we can build some kind of fortress, where the strategy is in the background.
“ But I think it would be much more powerful to do it with the fans, because the emotional aspects of the game will be added, only with the help of the fans at home. ”
Mourinho believes that with stronger rivals it will become increasingly difficult to maintain the long periods of global victory that he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up for the last three seasons.
But this is also a key factor in determining whether the end of the season will achieve its targets, especially in equal games and neighboring laws, where the atmosphere on the field can make a difference.
“ I believe that the course of the elite is becoming more and more difficult to beat because of the good things have gone by. ”
“ It is important to be strong at home, and at the end of the season, it has brought in a number of stairs with victories in home games. ”
“ I like the results of home games lately, without the fans, but we need them back.
I imagine a victory against Arsenal with the stadium full of Tottenham fans.
This is compassion, which is built up gradually."
Buyers excited about the aftereffects of lifestyle property in Lovely Banks
“ Bigger is better, ” apparently the motto of the new owners of huge estate in Lovely Banks, recently sold in 1270 Australian dollars.
Enthusiast merchants in search of a life - style property near Geelong’s center were able to look at these 1,35 acres of property, which can be found for 14 cars, swimming pools, and a view of Corio Bay.
Joe Grigic, a real estate broker in Harcourt, NorthGeelong, said that an offer on the property that Cuddy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of its introduction to the market.
Broome Cottge, Ocean Grove, back for sale
A Home Appointed for Inspiration
“ We received a number of offers from various sources, ” said Grigic.
“ The money was sold to a local man who's very excited about it. ”
The land property follows a four - room house on two floors, which includes a special bathroom big enough to cover a sofa.
The new owners have a choice of three living rooms and can use up a kitchen and updated outposts with a view of the pool.
“ This was in the way the property was composite, that it was three acres and that it was in this place, ” said Grigic.
“ There came interested merchants from Melbourne who wondered what the property was central and still had a country problem.
“ I have missing people and buyers who are still looking for them. ”
He said that the larger storage area, which includes a double garage and a well - arranged cloud that covers a 10-12 vehicle, was perfect for industrial workers, or to store trailers and postcarriers.
Counting Security Threatened in Iceland
“ Despite being appointed to one of the most secure countries in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been paranoid since he arrived in Reykjavík last year. ”
This is how the extensive discussion of CBS News of the U.S. ambassadors in Iceland begins, but this is what many sources of CBS from the U.S. Foreign Service are reporting.
In study of CBS, Gunter claimed to request from the U.S. Department of State that he would be granted special permission to carry firearms.
He should also have asked for an armored car, as well as some ideas about a vest that could protect him from stabbing attacks.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to state whether Gunter’s safety is really threatened in Iceland, but according to official information, Gunter has repeatedly been told that he is not in any particular danger.
Despite this, the U.S. embassy in Iceland recently advertised full - time bodyguards, including in the July 18th, issue of Morning, but CBS reports say it is done to ease Gunter’s concern.
The U.S. Department of State does not comment on visible security measures associated with its embassy, but it always says that safety is guaranteed in a preventive way.
The Ministry does not answer questions relating to Guntner’s wishes that armed populations and the Icelandic State Department do not want to determine whether the United States has formally requested a firearm, and does not usually comment on the security issues of foreign agencies.
CBS, however, quotes its Icelandic authorities as saying that this request was never submitted, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was brought down from his plans where they might offend Iceland’s citizens.
Also discussed in CBS the various problems that have been involved in the U.S. embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassadors last year, but he will already have distributed his warlord out seven times.
Thus, the first was said to have long prepared for his job and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the situation at the last minute because Gunter “does not leak to him ” at their first meeting.
His successors have not been much better under Gunters.
Government officials in the U.S. Department of State are said to be aware of the position in the Icelandic embassy, but they are reluctant to intervene in matters related to the President's close ties.
In addition to all of this, Gunter is said to be reluctant to comply with the various rules of foreign service and to respect the order of authority.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a conference in Washington, and is said to have refused to return to Iceland afterward and then let his temporary surrogate do his work for months, and that in the middle of a pandemic.
Will Gunter even have wished to do his job on absence and said that he would not return to Iceland unless the foreign minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically requested it.
According to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take a personal leave at the end of the conference and the crown virus epidemic delayd his quest even further, but according to CBS sources, many inside the Ministry have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but this has not been done until May, following Pompeo's contact with him and asked him to return to the embassy in Iceland.
Also reported in the CBS discussion are the unpopular Gunters in Iceland, especially in connection with a time when he called the crown virus the “unsuspecting China virus ” and has been criticized for it.
Gunter is one of the many, almost less experienced, foreign services appointed by ambassadors during the reign of President Donald Trump of the United States.
Sachin Pilot versus Ashok Gehlot; Bharatiya Janata Company reports government crisis; the Kong Press wants votes
Ashok Gehlot said that if necessary, the Congress Party would have to make a session protest outside the prime minister’s home.
On Saturday, day after a peaceful protest with Raj Bhawan, Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, the prime minister of Rajashan, said that if necessary the Continents of the Kong Press would have to meet the president and make appointments outside the prime minister’s home to lead the crisis in the state.
At a meeting of the Congressors of the Kong Press, Gehlot indicated that a decision was planned to be made to see if the majority of the members of the Party and the joint forces were with him in the power struggle.
“ He said the government has a majority and wants to take a vote, ” says Mahesh Joshi, the main party of the Kong Press, after the meeting.
The conference was held in a hotel, where members of the Parliament who support Gehlot have stayed in the past few days.
“ The prime minister asked us to be prepared to stay at the hotel longer.
If he had to, he said, he would meet the President and also hold peaceful protests outside the prime minister's home.
The prime minister of Rajashan can call the council together and make the Congressor show in his majority, said party leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, suggesting that the plots of the Bharatya Janata party had been uncovered to overthrow the government of Ashok Gehlot.
“ The country is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are formed and operate with the representatives of the people.
The plots of Bharatiya Janata have been discovered to overthrow the government of Rasthan from a chair.
This is an insult to 80 million people of Rasthan.
The Chief Minister must call the council together for the truth to come ahead of the country," said Gandhi in a tit on Hindu.
Asok Gehlot, the prime minister of Rasisthan, told the Congressors on Saturday that he was ready to go to the president of India to make sure that what he calls “the Council of Bharatya Janata ” is not being held in line for a vote statement.
Gehlot, who protested for hours to the home of the governor Kalrai Mishra on Friday to press a conference, met with the Congressors and the government on Saturday, and after meeting, new suggestions were made and approved by the government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to re-invest the meeting request and referred to six objections.
The proposal will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of stalling the meeting, where he is “under pressure ” to delay the vote that determines trust in his government.
When Gehlot met his government, the delegation of Bharatiya Janata, led by leader Satish Ponia and the leader of the government, Gulab Chandra Katria, with the governor to discuss the state’s status of VID-19.

Spencer Grammer's actress gave a ditch outside a restaurant in Manhattan.
NEW YORK — The Dramatic Spencer Grammar said he was trying to calm an angry man when he cut her arm and stuck her friend in the back outside a restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, 36 years old, told US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation as that they had been trying to prevent things from getting worse when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32 - year - old friend were sitting at the table of The Black Ant in East Village Manhattan about 11:30 p.m.
Friday, when a man approached them and demanded payment, the restaurant was closing.
Grammer and her friend were hurt when they tried to “resolve differences between an unknown man and other local guests, ” says police officers.
After hurting Grammer’s right arm, the man ran off the spot and stabbed her friend in the narrow back with an unknown sharp object, a police officer said.
No one's been arrested.
Grammer, who speaks for Summer in the series "Rick and Morty" and used to play in the series "Greek" on ABC Family, is the daughter of the "Frasier" Star of Kelsey Grammer and the actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both she and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a declaration to US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded in the field and staff of the Bellevue Hospital who cared for them and mentioned the “probably difficult ” of these personnel during the Korean epidemic.
“ It really touched us to have the opportunity to thank them in person, ” said Grammer.
“ I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I’m here to help people. — Chimaev, after a historic evening on UFC Light Island — RT Sports News
The Fighter Khamzat Chimaev of Russia is now named as the next star of the UFC after writing in the story at Fright Island, but he does not claim to flaunt his wealth in a foolish way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev beat his rival on Saturday night when three minutes and 9 seconds had passed the first round by firing him in the floor.
The victory recorded the name Chimaev in UFC history for the shortest time between winnings in modern history, where only 10 days had passed since he conquered British John Phillips in a similar decisive way, then in a middleweight.
Chimaev, who has a victory rate of 8-0, received 50,000 American bonuses for the performance of the evening against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now known as the “Chalib 2.0, ” which can be said to be an inevitable comparison because of the magnitude between Chimaev and the UFC master's weight and his birth in Chechnya, which is near the time of Khabib, Dagestan.
Despite recent fame and financial gain, the important Chimaev has said that he would not be greedy to flaunt his wealth like the MIA coin machine Conor McGregor or his match in the box world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I don’t do it just for me, I do it for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," replied Chimaev when he was asked that at Fright Island how he would use his bonus.
He has called attention to Conor McGregor’s teammate and the active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the community label that he could “exquisitely ” defeat Chimaev by surrendering.
It was not a poisonous answer from the fighter who walks under the name “Borz, ” or“ wolf, ” in his mother tongue, Tentenan, who said that he would “keep his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who is now in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the country at the age of 19, may have little to do with his financial power, but apparently he is not shy about showing off his fighting skills.
“ I can crush anyone ...
How many fighters are in the balance department?
I can crush them all," he said.
“ Give me 77 kilograms of champions (employed weight), 84 kilograms of champions, I'll crush them both, that day. ”
The Israelis continue to protest the Prime Minister’s response to the pandemic
JERUSALEM — Thousands of Israela protested against the prime minister in many parts of the country on Saturday, with the greatest protests except the official seat of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks, but they began because critics feel that the government’s neglect to respond to the crown - virus diets after initially controlling the threat of the virus.
The charges against Netanyahu because of corruption have further promoted protests.
“ Bibi, go home, ” said the sign of one of the Protestants.
Another card said, “Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
There were also hundreds of Protestants gathered outside Netanyhu coastal halls in the very wealthy town of Caesar.
Last week, the police used water guns to scatter groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called a rash and unorganized reopening of the economy in May, the average number of new cases per day increased to 2000.
The country’s economy has suffered from impacts due to viral restrictions, and unemployment has increased to nearly 20%.
Protestants say that the government’s financial assistance has not been sufficient.
The protest took place in the shadow of a trial of corruption against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
The hearing begins in January.
He is charged with fraud, trust failure, and bribery in a series of scandals.

Fifty people mass limits at the Eid festival, and no prayer parties in Eidgah, say the government of Karna taking
The festival Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, takes place on 31 July and August 1.
Governments in Karnaak have issued that only 50 can be assembled in the coffers for the prayers of Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer meetings at Edgah and other locations due to the rabbit virus epidemic.
Visitors wishing to pray in crumbs must wear masks and keep distance, according to AB Ibrahim's orders, the head of the Ministry of minorities and Wakf.
The order shows that the Hillal Committee decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also known as or Bakrid, is held on July 31, Udupi, Dakshina Kanna and Koda, but August 1 in the rest of the state.
The decree states that while prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of Muslims on the Brerid festival, such events will be banned in Eidgah and other sites due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Yet, prayers will be allowed in the moss provided that no more than 50 are involved.
More people than it should be replaced by prayer, says the Ministry of the Directive.
Prayer meetings must not be held anywhere else, such as meeting halls, social centers, or “Shadi Mahal, ” as stated.
Karnaaka authorities allow temples, moss, and other prayers to be opened to those who want to pray on June 8, provided they are careful with protection from VID-19.
The American ambassador wants an armed bodyguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. ambassador of the United States, believes that his life is threatened here and wants to carry arms.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. ambassadors repeatedly advertised lifeguards in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Kellor’s records, the main reason for these jobs is that ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter feels threatened in Iceland.
Sickness has been discussed with sources in Iceland and abroad, who have convinced the ambassador that he is in great danger, and why he is Jewish.
What the threat is not as clear, but the interviewers Kavids said that Islamic terrorists had been called a threat.
The CBS TV was discussing the matter on its website this morning, leaving sources in Washington that Gunter is paranoid, insisting on carrying weapons himself, getting a punctureproof vest, and carrying an armed escort, as well as a bullet-proof car.
According to CBS, Gunter has repeatedly been told that there is no threat and that the advertisement by the bodyguard is only to calm Gunter.
According to Keilur’s records, the positions were not filled by the end of June, but the deadline for application came out in February.
According to Keilur's sources, there has not been a formal exchange from the U.S. embassy for these changes.
There has been no formal request for increased protection or permission for bodyguards to walk around the doors of the embassy.
The Icelandic law makes it clear that it is allowed only by a special authority from the State Marshal.
The Advisors of the Management System say there is no information about any kind of threat.
The latest State Marshal's assessment of terrorism is somewhat significant.
There are no cases of terrorism in Iceland, and there is no evidence of terrorist or extreme groups working here.
The premises for allowing the arms of foreign bodyguards on the streets of cities and towns in Iceland are, according to Kistur's sources, not available.
Gunter brought considerable attention to this country when he shared the U.S. presidentship of the United States and called the VID-19 “Chine Virus. ”
Then he had the American and Icelandic flag.
A radioman in Seattle who mocked Trump's reaction to protests says he now needs a gun after the Starbucks coffeehouse beneath his apartment was destroyed — the RT USA News
Paul Gallant has received a new perspective on a violent protest after mocking President Donald Trump of the United States in June for saying that anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle City.
The only thing had to be done was to move in closer to the home of the factor manager.
“ I feel like I have to buy a firearm because this will clearly continue to happen, ” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday nights after he saw that vandals had “instinct ” the Starbucks Cafe on the bottom floor of his apartment house.
It looks like a street party down the street from me, really angry now.
The shock was quite like that when Trump complained that the mayor of Seattle was allowing violent Protestants to take over the city.
“ These liberal Democrats are senseless, ” said the president.
“ The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they think it’s just wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, who is a member of the “Danny & Gallant ” program at ESPN's Association Radio station in Seattle, replied:“ It was there for curiosity last night and saw neither burns, robbery, nor death.
Gallant said last night that the police had advised the people to stay away from his apartment building where explosives might be being found in the damaged Starbucks Cafe.
He published pictures of the damage, saying, “Well done, morons, ” and stated that he had also seen fire several blocks away.
“ I have no idea what's going on, but we cat and I are going to find out. ”
The reversal did not go unnoticed by people who ridiculed Gallant for his earlier opinion and took note of such messages as “Just relax on salmon, ” and“ Jonah, maybe Trump was right. ”
Jason Rantz, another Seattle radio man, said, “I guess we're finally going on this tour we talked about. ”
Gallant went to the joke: “Wake up, and saw that a lot of people were "screaming on salmon. "
He said he was standing up to his earlier statements as if he had walked through the CHAZ auto-control area of anarchist and though it wasn't as bad as it had been the issue.
“ So there was a burning and a robbery after all, ” he said.
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, camping with her 28-year-old lover, Tom Rrays Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rrays Harries, started together at the set point of the White Lines, covering the disgruntled and ambiza, but in the search of a past week, their countenance was different and quieter, away from the pleasures of the party island.
The couple, who plays siblings in the popular Netflix series, saw an impressive farm in Oxfordshire for sale of 1.2 million pounds.
They arrived in the Range Rover area, which Laura, 34, drove, dressed in jeans and white shirts, and met a real estate dealer who led them to a tour of the five - room house.
In White Lines, taken up last fall, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who comes to know the darker side of Ibiza as she investigates the murder of her brother, the DJ Alex, who is playing with Tom, 28 years old.
Their relationship remained until earlier this month, less than a year after Laura and Sam Claflin’s six - year marriage ended, known as the Hunger Games films.
Together, they have a four - year - old son, Pip and his daughter, Margot, who are two years old.
When they announced the divorce last August, Cllinin, 34, in Instagram, wrote: “I have decided to understand the law, to understand love, friendship, and deep respect for each other, and to continue our cooperation in raising our children.
Laura and Sam met first in 2011 for an audition, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, described their marriage in 2013 as “one of the greatest achievements of my life. ”
Before Laura got her part in White Lines, she had played in the first Inbetweens film, and in the criminal fantasy The Capture of the BBC, which was shown last year, as she played the lawyer for Hannah Roberts.
Tom took a role in the second Inbetweeners film and in the series Brittnia from Sky.
Thinks too early to claim a second wave here on the land
One expert on the prevention field at the surgeon general says it is too early to claim the second wave of the pandemic.
Three new domestic transmissions were identified at the National Hospital’s Center’s Center’s Center for Disease Control, and dozens are in a hospital.
Two internal transmissions were detected on Thursday, one in a man in his 20 ’ s, and the other in a male in his 20 ’ s.
Then no infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Last night, there were three additional domestic transmissions, one of which had been at Rey Cup soccer convention in Laugar Valley.
John K. Jonsson, a U.S. Marshal for information, says in a conversation with a news agency that fewer people had to be taken because of the infection than originally thought.
The second contact is with a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15.
By then, the rules of such a so - called world pollution had been accepted.
In contrast, Kamilla Ruth Sigfustótttótttóttir, an expert on the Center for Disease Control, says that the person followed the old process.
His vision was negative when he arrived in the country, but then he became ill, was in solitary, and six have been implicated.
They're all on their way to take samples, but two of them are showing symptoms.
The third infection is linked to the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday, and 12 have been placed in a hospital.
It has been found to be a new form of the non-renew crown virus in this country.
“ We don’t know exactly where this virus is coming from, but we haven’t seen it before.
One who is believed to have borne the virus to the land had been in Israel, but also in other European countries."
She feels that it is too early to claim that the so - called second wave of an epidemic has begun in this country, as other European countries fear.
“ As long as the majority are still traceable, it is not a tableboarding factor.
But we're on our toes, and we're watching, thinking of ways to fail if anything like that could happen."
Megan Fox expressing himself about the relationship
Megan Fox says he found his twin soul in rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
“ As soon as I found him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I'm interested in constellations, and I immediately knew that it was my twin soul," says 34 - year - old Fox.
“ The twin soul is when the soul has come in the way of existence enough to allow it to divide into two different bodies at the same time, ” explained Fox.
“ So we are two halves of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away."
“ After two days of our acquaintance, I asked him to meet me for lunch, and I studied with him about the constellations and asked him about his life.
I decided to go to the depth right away."
Machine Gun Kelly agrees, but they met at film films.
“ I was hanging outside her trailer, hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
It has only been two months since Fox left his husband for ten years, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Knye apologizes to Kim.
The American musician, fashion medium, and president of Kanye West have apologized to his wife Kim Kardashian West for comments he made public about family personal matters.
“ I'd like to apologize to my wife Kim for having discussed personal matters publicly, ” he wrote last night in a Twitter entry.
There have been many speculations about the state of their relationship, but Kanye has recently gone to great social media and at a mass meeting he held last Monday, among other things, discussed the birth of his daughter North West and said he almost killed her.
Then, on Wednesday afternoon, Kim published a message to his followers in Instagram, where she discussed the illness of her husband, who is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously been publicly informed about her husband’s illness, saying that, among other things, because of their children and the right of Kanye for privacy when it came to his health.

Increased weight in protests against racial discrimination in the United States
Protestants have walked the streets of many cities in the United States to call attention to racial discrimination.
Conventions have lasted for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd was held captive by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent federal agents to Portland, which has further fueled the protests.
The Protestants are also protesting the presence of the FBI in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, police used flash blasts and tear gas and arrested 45 people after protesting to support the Portland protesters.
According to the police, over 20 police officers were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was fired into Black Lives Matter’s march.
Sources say that the man may have walked up to a car armed with rifles before he was shot.
“ The point of the matter is that it is terrible that someone should die in protests, ” said the mayor of Austin, Steve Adler in a statement.
Adler said that he was “suffed and dumb. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with no permission to knock, and shot her.
Taylor's boyfriend had first shot the police, because he thought they were burglars.
One officer has been fired for Taylor's death, but the other officers have not been prosecuted.
The leader of the NFAC group, an armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in a police investigation of Taylor's murder.
According to police records, three members of NFAC were injured on Saturday when a gun accidentally fired at the rebel forces.
Potential for a group infection
Five have been identified with Covid-19 infections this week out of the border population.
Two of the infected were diagnosed with a previously unseen form of the virus, and it appears that the origin of three of the five infections was completely unclear.
Whether individuals have been infected by a tourist who has left the country or by the asymptomatic Icelanders, who may have been infected by many more.
According to a local preventiveian, a possible group infection may be in the presence of one of the infections.
Two were identified by Covid-19 in the country last Thursday, with separate types of virus.
The origin of the virus is still unclear.
Three of them were diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected with another of those found on Thursday; another came to the country last July 15 and was likely infected with the virus, but the third is also infected by a vague source.
Following a serial analysis of the Icelandic genetic analysis, it was found that the two subjects diagnosed with the virus and associated with a new variant that has not been previously identified in this country.
Kamilla Joseph’s daughter, an expert on the prevention of disease at the surgeon’s surgeon and a surrogate anticoagulant, says that the Icelandic genetic analysis is now crossing from where it is most likely that this type of virus came.
“ The second case was similar to a virus that has been circulating in Switzerland, but not quite the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it more carefully and lead a chance to what part of the world it's coming from," she says.
“ However, it seems to be on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. ”
Thus, the two infections that came up early in July were attributed to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has come to the outside rather than leaping around here in the country?
“ Yeah, it's different from what's been found here before that there's really no chance that it was something going on here, ” says Kamilla.
“ They are all more likely to have somehow been exposed to someone who has just come from somewhere outside without knowing it."
When asked, it says that at present there is no indication of where these new viruses might have come from.
“ It may be a tourist who has left the country again, but there may also be someone who does not get symptoms and who does not realize that he has been infected, and then, of course, there may be more infections.
We'll be on our toes for the next few days to keep track of it."
“ In the meantime, there is no such thing as a smart group infection.
But there are individuals who went to a hospital in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and who have already taken samples," Chemilla continues.
“ We haven’t returned the results yet.
So it could be a possible cluster infection."
Do you assume there is social contamination now?
“ That is not impossible.
It hasn't been recently, but it's not excluded, because we don't know who's been carrying this infection in these individuals who were diagnosed on Tuesday and on the third day, but yesterday it answers.
Would it be possible to say that this is a new wave of the virus is about to begin?
“ No, not yet.
Of course, we need to be very alert, and we need to keep this in mind, even though there are so limited limits to how much samples we can take.
We don't take samples from asymptomatic people, but since we're getting infections that seem untraceable, we need to be given some available hands by taking samples of people with symptoms," she says.
Thus, in the next few days, the National Institute for Pathology and Pathology will be expected to re-inservate the situation in our country.
Does the Landspita have the ability to increase local sample collections and to conduct screenings at the border?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there must be some basis for taking samples from individuals who are not in the screening initiatives; they need to be in an illness and display symptoms or are suspected of being exposed to someone who has just arrived or something like this," says Kamilla.
It says that the infections identified yesterday are still on and that there is a lot of work to do in getting information about individual travel.
It says that the origin of the internal virus appears to be impervious, but it does not rule out that any persons who have now been placed in an illness could bring clues that eventually lead to the spread of infectious diseases.
The restaurant most people don't know about, but they think one of the best.
Not all people have a clear location on Savestone restaurants and probably have more fans out of the country than they do in this country if the comments on it can be applied in TripAdvisor and other pages.
It has been heard of people who have flown to their country to visit him with no surprise.
Berglindur Hiktsdótttir, Food Bolgar, and cookbook writer, jumped on Savingrstein in the days, and kept water out of love
“ I don’t know where to start, because where to start, the restaurant rescues a suspect, it's a wonderful place to say.
The story of the house is one of the sweetest things I know, the food of ten, don't look at the worse end, and a wonderful servant!" says Bergur.
“ The owner of Saverstein energized one precious court after another in front of us.
My wife and I sat with our girls for a night to have dinner, so there must be a point of how good the food was, "Berglind adds.
“ The house that the restaurant is being thrown out of is an old apartment, which was taken whole to a clinic.
The modern owners turned their eyes to this house for sale on Akranesi, found a beautiful seabed on suspects, and made the dream come true.
You can read more about the history of the house on the Home of Savingstein."
“ The temples and all the work of saving the stone are remarkable.
The entire family has been gathered together, and they are certainly putting their trust in the home.
On the upper floor, there is a living room and a really cosy and homelike place to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and the cooking are then unsuspecting, and it is clear that magic is used to produce tasty and beautiful refreshments, says Berg Fountain, and the pictures can be marked as nothing can be lied.

Joakim Prince Dana, Jr., son of Queen Margaret Thorhild Dana and the late Henry Prince of Dana, is still in hospital in Toulouse, France, where he had surgery last day because of a blood clot in the brain.
The Danish national radio DR quotes a spokesperson of the Danish court as uncertain how long the 51 - year - old prince will be in the hospital, but his condition remains constant.
According to a DR report, we are now studying the effects of the blood clot on the health of the prince.
There, doctor Peter Qvortrup Geisling, a health issue for DR, observed that the consequences of a blood clot in the brain often do not occur until 24 hours post-operatively.
“ It may range from minimal symptoms to hemiparesis, memory problems or difficulties with expression, ” says Geisling.
He says the Prince could wait many months for rehabilitation.
Prince Joakim Dana, whose full name is Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian, is also a Count of Monpezat, stayed in the family vineyard, Château de Cayx, South France, when he got sick on Friday night.
He was first taken to a hospital in the town of Chors, which is not far from the farm, but then moved to the university hospital in Toulouse, where he had an operation due to a blood clot in the brain.
Google Pixel 4 can form the galaxy
A double octotic zoom enables the extra lens of Pixel 4 to see in 3D, thereby resulting in better anger in the background using a facial settings than in the previous Pixel time, which relys heavily on software to achieve this so-called ‘bokeh’ effect.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google the mythical photographer Annie Leibovitz got on stage to discuss his experiences of photography with Pixel 4 during the last 12 months.
In the framework of all aspects of new smartphones from Google, mechanical technology is still being used to improve HDR+ settings by combining up to nine different images.
New dual exposure management offers different sledges for brightness and shadows and allows users to preview HDR+ during real time.
The phone also leans on mechanical technology to offer better automatic white balances and improves the "Night Light" setting, which is so sensitive that it can capture the Milky Way galaxy in the night sky.
In addition to other camera operators, Pixel 4 Soli introduces a “Rareas flake student” on the front of the phone that detects the Motion Senense movements so that users can skip the song, turn off time measures, place an alarm on a nap, or turn off the sound of the phone by waving their hand.
Everyone calculates the music sense in the machine instead of connecting to the Internet and the same thing applies to the improved Google helpers, where the technologies now focus on shortening the response time and improving the identity of the user.
The continued emphasis on using Google’s mechanical capacity to the full has also led to a new voice tap containing live sound without sending data to the Internet.
The application is currently available only in English, but more languages are coming.
Pixel 4 will also be the first line to support Google Stidia, a game scene in the cloud that will be fired from the 19th of November, U.S.A., but still after reporting on a date for Australia.
In addition to new Pixel phone, Google also introduced a new Pixelbook Go Chremebook computer and another generation of Google Pixel Buds earphones.

A fisherman “loves to throw a bottle of beer into a seal ” in Devon
A fisherman threw a bottle of beer into a seal when he interrupted the fishing line, according to a charity organization.
Pictures taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay appear to show a man on a rock who throws an object towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said that the gray seal was hunting when the fisherman emptied it out of a bottle and threw it into the animal’s back.
Kenny called it "soundly and thoughtless behaviour."
He said that he was picking up garbage at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning, along with other people at the Seal Project, who witnessed the attack.
“ The boy tried to get in the fishing line, ” he said.
“ The fisherman stretched the beer, emptied the bottle, and threw it into the seal.
“ The wallet landed on the seal’s back, and he swam away. ”
A teacher said that “blessly sold animals ” were simply doing what was natural to him.
“ By throwing a glass bottle into it, ” he said, “you’re stopping him at his hunting.
The Seal Project Company said that this was a “no single incident ” and that it had recently received“ several reports of these aggressive behaviors. ”
The company’s Facebook account says that its volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage in the collection at Hope's Nose on Sunday and that “many examples of antisocial behavior ” had been observed.
All seals are protected by the law for the protection of seals, and people are asked to stay away from them.
A Kristnapoli rise in Laxá, Dals
The first hundred were caught in Laxá, in the late afternoon.
It was Arnor Isfjörðundsson.
He had put it in a spawn in Kristinapolis this morning and was about eight inches [ 89 cm].
In the afternoon, he again had the option of a Christianpolis and thought of a story he had heard about the slowness of seeing that the raven had suffered.
With this in mind, he took Collie Dog’s slipper and threw it over Kristinapolil.
Soon he got the shot and as he himself reports.
“ In about five seconds, he cleaned up completely, and I realized that it was the record.
I got a little nervous with 11 pounds.
Usually, I'd take fish fast, but I had this for 40 minutes.
Actually, he was quite comfortable.
I took a few trips up and down the pond, but then I found myself stranding it, and it felt great.
I got the stick off and I jumped on it.
He was tested 200 inches [12 cm] and I tweeted him," said a merry hunter at the hunting house of Throngal weekend in Laxá, in Dalls in a conversation with Swords.
Arnor is no beginer when it comes to hundreds of calls.
That was his eighth.
He got fish like that in Bela, Black River, Traussfjördur, Kjarrá, two in Langadalia, and one in the Earst of the Ranger River.
Good hunting is in Laxá in the Valleys, says Arnors.
The hole that finishes at noon tomorrow has 35 salmon, and our man has 18 of them.
Expecting Great Floods for Hannah

Despite the rapid loss of power, Hannah became more stormy than the rain that has occurred in the area and is expected to be extensive floods.
It is expected to reach as much as 30 inches [3 cm] of rain in one day, but it could reach up to 46 centimetres, according to the AP News Department.
Especially do we warn of devastating floods that could occur because of the rain.
The area where Hannah reached the land has been under attack because of the widespread distribution of the new crown virus there.
In addition, ocean has gone ashore and has caused damage.
Now there are at least 43,700 people without electricity and mass relief centers in the area have been opened.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, hung on the hurricane last night and said it was important that people listen to experts and follow instructions.

Houses burned, stores robbed, and internal damages
More than sixty are dead, and another sixty are wounded after an attack in the village of Master in Darfur, Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in a series of serious safety developments during the last few weeks where houses were burned, shops and markets were pillaged and destroyed, ” states a statement by the United Nations Human Rights Office in Kartum, the capital of the city that was sent out today.
Kadan’s prime minister, Abdall Hamdok, has issued that security forces will be sent to the war - torn region to “protect the inhabitants and the harvest. ”
Only two days ago, an unknown army in the area killed at least 20 citizens, including children, in another attack.
“ The level of violence in different parts of Darfur County is leading to an increased root, creating agriculture at risk and threatening life and living bread, ” says the United Nations.
Darfur, in the western part of Sudan, began in 2003 when most Arab rebels rose against the governor of Kartum.
Government forces and Arab troops who tried to kill the rebellion have been accused of widespread atrocities, but some 300,000 were killed in the United Nations opinion.
Omas al-Bashir, who was deposed to be leader of Sudan, is wanted by the International Crime Court for alleged war crime, genocide and crime against mankind in Darfur.
Meanwhile, a new government in Sudan is now trying to negotiate peace with the main rebels.

TAMPA, Florida (AP) — A TV reporter in Florida thanks to an attentive observer for noticing a lump on her neck and e - mailing her that she should have him checked out.
Victoria Price, a reporter at WFLA, Tampa, followed this advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price said on Twitter that she would have surgery on Monday to have her tumour, the thyroid, and some lymph nodes removed.
“ The doctor said it was spreading, but not too much, and we hope this will be my first and last action, ” she said.
The audience sent Price e-mail last month and said that the noodle reminded her of a knot she had.
Price, a 28 - year - old researcher, said that her television station's slogan was “8 on your side. ”
“ But the roles were recently exchanged when an observer was on the team with MÉR, and I couldn’t be more appreciative, ” said Price.
“ I will always be grateful to the woman who made an effort to e - mail me, a total stranger.
She had no obligation, but she did.
Talk about being on a team."
Parts of the Jeronimo Openace outdoor area temporarily closed after two attacks by coyotes — CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by coyotes near the Oso Creek Road Road Road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning, and the route had to be closed temporarily.
Laura Wittmer says she sees coyotes almost every morning and usually she tries to avoid them just, but on Saturday morning one came right at her and bit her leg.
The spider has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
A Mission Viejo published: “Today two different parties announced that a coyote had bited a human.
Wittmer tried to knock off the coyote with a bottle of water.
She called in the emergency line to get a ride to her car, but she could drive herself to an emergency reception.
The coyote disappeared, but public workers hope to expel him and test him for rabies.
Wittmer will be treated for rabies as a precautionary measure for the next two weeks.
She said this scary incident would not keep her away from the morning runs, but from now on, she would choose a different place.
The condition of the person who was bitten is not clear.
Protestant hatred of race strikes with police in Seattle.
A campaign in Seattle Sunday between police and Protestantism ended with the arrest of a large number of people, while dissatisfactions among the public on the basis of President Donald Trump's plans to send a number of federal agents into major cities.
Objections against racism and police violence have occurred following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis in May.
In Seattle, protesters cut bicycle cars and smashed windows in bicycle doors on the protesters on Saturday, which led to police reporting riot state and emptying the streets with pepper sprays and flash bombs.
Protestants also set bikes on a construction site for future youth imprisonment.
The police claimed that they had arrested 45 people, but 21 police officers had been injured.
The protest march was held to support the protests held in the neighboring Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the limelight after Trump ordered a very controversial action by the FBI in unsolicited local authorities, who say the police use excessive force.
Conventions have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, and Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of the state of Texas, one shot killed in an armed conflict in the downtown town on Saturday night, says police.
In November, Trump, as well as the protesters, is increasingly difficult to redecorate, and has adopted a severe law enforcement policy.
