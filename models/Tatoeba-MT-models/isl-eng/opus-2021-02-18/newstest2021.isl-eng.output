Crying for the World
The Market campaign Looks Like You Need Island seems to have been well started, and shouting and shouting in the wild are beginning to pull people around the world.
“ You have your own QA, I need Iceland, ” said one woman in the big world in comments on a commercial campaign advertisement Luok Like You Need Iceland on the resource team YouTube.
Another observer says she'll keep Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she has to come to Iceland as soon as possible, because her fiancé lives there.
Unfortunately, though, in the United States she is expecting to wait some more months.
Another observer asks if the route to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
You can't follow the story if it comes out of another time zone.
Eric Thordison of the Pelel Advertising Office, as well as the International Advertising Office M·C Zaatchi, said that there have been further hopes.
“ I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful but this new campaign is already beating record.
In the ground, this is about creating a PR-value, it's getting foreign media to talk about the campaign, and it's been extremely successful.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received a worldwide coverage of some seven hundred media that total the total number of more than two billion people.
The value of this coverage is $1,6 billion.
It's not too bad."
The major market is the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, although Americans are not on their way to the country for a while.
According to Eils, such markets as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also responded well, such as Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
Then there were reactions from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically suggested.
“ These advertisements have traveled far beyond what we expected, ” says Eric, but more than four million people may have watched the contents of YouTube.
“ We couldn’t have wished for a better start. ”
The photos here on the open opened took The Year of Saeberg, a photographer of the Morning Magazine, while shooting advertisements bearing the heading “Let Out ” in the middle of the last month.
And the tables spread far and wide, as in the porch of the prison in Reykjavík, at the foot of the forest, at the place of the sun, and in the cave at the head of the earth.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Paul Ólafsson of the Scotland Productions and cameraman of Fear the son of God.
The roles provided were Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
The advertising was introduced by dozens of Icelanders, but at the same time as recordings in the South, another group in Western and Western lands was present.
According to Eils, only the first team in the Look Like You Need Ireland campaign is scheduled for winter campaigns in cooperation with M =C Satchi.
“ It’s just the first phase of this job for Iceland, ” says Eric, adding that the cooperation with M·C Zaatchi was extremely successful.
“ Working with them is great.
In such projects it's important to have a foreign associate with the knowledge of the markets we're talking to."
Explosive: Talk about the job market, pension fund, and many more
Ásmundur Einar Daddason, U.S. Department of Social Affairs, will be arriving at the bombing, starting at 10 p.m. today.
He's also a labour minister, discussing the situation in a labour market as such, the Icelandair case, and more cases.
It also discusses national and land transport activities that have gone badly and have been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of the VR, also attends the program, but he will discuss his criticism about the investments of pensions and lays out ideas that labor movement and professional drivers will withdraw from the fund’s governments to reduce the risk of economic conflict.
Then we will discuss with them Dr. Ivar Igmarsson, a traveler in the East, and Aarging Jonsdodóttt, director of the Northern Market Office, about the situation in a travel service in the country.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder whether the success of the summer is a misleading charge of what will come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10:00.
This is what she looks like today 25 years later
Elisa Donovan, the actress, had a successful career in all kinds of teenage parts.
But she received world fame before her acting as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
Then she also played with Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Although she has recently been exposed to it, she was moved to look over and express herself about Clueless in Australian television during the days.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
“ I have to admit that I built my character mostly on girls I met at school who were not nice to me.
As soon as I read the script I knew who that person was," Donovan said about his game in Clueless.
I didn't want to leave the police station after a night's rest.
About 50 cases came at the police table in the capital area today, saying in the police diary that the situation was varied.
The day at the police station at Leafs Street began with the need for police involvement with a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there because of drunk driving.
After his release, the man did not want to go away and fail to obey the instructions of the police who told him to leave.
The man made a continuing stay at the police station because of his conduct.
Then a man was arrested this morning on suspicion of burglary in a Kopavogi firm.
Police also had to interfere with two men in Brenoli because of reports of assault.
Then, too, a woman who was a shopkeeper at a Kapavogi shopping mall could not pay for the account after a meal and was therefore called to the police.
A stolen car was also reported downtown this morning.
In time, the White Renault van driver looked at it and was taken by a free hand.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Happy Company - A terrible fate for the Happy Stars
The theory of flight on the Internet has been a curse to the development of the joy squad, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California during the days and thus became the third leading act in order to die long before age.
The ranks of the happy throngs are a popular series of singing, dancing, and joys.
The features dealt with a so - called youth gang in high school, with their love and destiny.
It was not always taken out with pleasure to be part of the community, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the show seemed to be overemphasizing whatever circumstances existed in their lives.
But outside the location of the shooting, the players and the members of the program have been affected by a disaster, so much so that theories have been raised to curse the elements.
Naya Marie Rivera took the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who didn't call all her grandmother.
After the series had run its course, Rivera began to marry actor Ryan Dorsey and had her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017 Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to file charges, and the domestic violence was dropped.
Last July 8, it was announced that Rivera was missed after her four - year - old son was found alone driving in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy felt asleep on the boat in a storm of rescue, and he could tell the police authorities that he and his mother had killed themselves, and then Rivera would have brought him back into the boat, but he would never return.
Exploded search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area reported that we were walking away from Rivera’s drowning.
Five days later Rivera was found and publicly ordered.
It is thought that she had fallen into a vast stream of water and made use of her last requirement to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded as drowning in an accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took the role of the Finn Hudson in the series, the American soccer player with the angelic voice, who played a key role in bringing the joy party to glory and respect.
However, outside the program, Monitelith wrestled with personal demons.
Since he was 13 years old, he struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his associates felt that they had enough, got involved, and encouraged him to seek help.
Monitth then went on therapy and appeared to be looking for better.
Just two months after he finished the treatment, Moniteth was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Bananas were found to be a lethal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that there was a willful act.
Monitth had been treated and his tolerance to drugs had decreased so much that the dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His execution was heavy on his coworkers, but under the direction of his opponent, Leah Michele, was determined to continue taking the show and dedicated them to the full memory of Monitth and his character, Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and showed little respect for his fellow members in the joy squad, or until he became discouraged to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles suspected of the possession of child pornography.
While at home, he felt that there was a huge amount of child pornography, and the matter was soon publicized.
It was clear that Salling had already been destroyed.
As a result, he was accused and convicted of his wrongdoing.
He had four or seven years in prison, as well as a list of sexual offenders who sought to treat their children.
Before a judge had determined the penalty, Salling, then released from bail, felt left near her home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors of the show who died long before they were born.
Jim Fuller was the associate director of the show.
In 2013, only 41 years of age, he quickly fell asleep.
The show also won a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the star Julius Roberts and did not bear her sister the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of her great way of ruling and disrespectful conduct.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with major depression.
She left a letter to her beloved, asking her mother and sister, including the responsibility of her situation.
“ My mother and my so - called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that it was the ones that caused my worst depression. ”
Leah Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of being bullied and bullied by her collapsible stars.
In 2012, Jesse Luken took a guest role in the show.
In 2019 he was arrested and charged with drunk driving, which seemed to be a scandal.
The actress, Heather Morris, played a big part in the show.
It happened in 2010 that an unsolved computer thief could get naked pictures of it and light it on the Internet.
Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the show and had an affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used violence in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
When children are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and be watched for their growth.
There is also endlessly possible flowers, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a little time with the children in the park is something you never forget.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and, of course, the precious time they spent with their parents.
Buying a boat after the tenth grade
“ I don’t think we're many sailors working in the parks in the country, ” says Axel Arrow Guðmundsson, who is fishing beach fishing in summer while studying psychology at the University of Iceland during wintertime."
Coast fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you study.
If well - fished, you can make a good living, and I love to let go of a student’s loan.
The revenues are also good for me in the winter," says Axel Eagle Gudmundsson, a 25-year psychology student, who spends some of the last summers on shore fishing.
Axel had just docked at the Elegant when a journalist talked to him late at night at the beginning of the week."
“ The magazine I was in in the tenth grade took a boat - management license that was less than 12 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished high school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summers since.
I bought the boat used by a friend of mine, Hartmann son of Jon, and I named the boat his name.
When I bought the boat and stopped at sea, Hartmann had grown up, and he was pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“ I made a contract with Hartmann to pay half a million dollars at the start of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I had fished.
So at the end of this first summer of mine, I owed the boat without debt."
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay in a boat when he had just finished high school?
“ When I was a boy, I had saved my money and I had been working with my father to sea, I was all summer fishing with him, and I got my share.
I also put my square money in my boat fund."
Alex is born on Ice Juice, from where all his mother's people are, but he's lived in Kopavogi since he was a boy.
“ I can hunt here in the West because I have a home of my grandmother’s law in Isifi.
I learned these areas west of here by rowing with my father.
I move between the distances according to how I feel, because this fishing area covers the rest of the West.
Although I find it best to be in the west, I have also been caught around the Snæfells and other places.
I've also been fishing in the south, but I think it's a gray patch," says Axel, who always robs one little fire in the morning and sometimes says, "I'll talk to the seagulls and sing to the sky, alone for hours in the ocean."
“ The Internet at sea is good, so I can call, listen to radio shows, and music.
I don't think it's a big deal to be on my own.
Of course I try to avoid getting into danger, but certainly, occasionally something's been up to the weather, but never much danger," says Axel, who's lucky that he's never seasick.
He says that the length of the workday depends on how the fishing works every time.
“ I’ve never spent more than 14 hours fishing at once, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, such as in the door of rent, and I’ve spent a day and a half in fishing at sea. ”
The coastal water supply says it is so that it can catch 770 pounds [770 kg] a day, which he feels is antagonizing.
“ Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to catch Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and I am allowed to catch only 12 days a month, during the four months of coast fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days for the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is to calm down instead of having 48 days for the whole summer and to be able to choose for themselves.
So the regional divisions could also go for me, and seaspace, which is well situated at the fishing grounds, should enjoy it," says Axel, who, in turn, reduces mostly the water from the salts on its coastal seas, but also only a few and a few other rivers with.
Alex works for winter with the University of Núpi, Kópavogi.
“ I don’t think we're many sailors working in the U.S. classrooms, ” says Axel proudly and adds, “and he was only going to work for a little time at the nursery.
“ I got stuck there because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that my psychology course will benefit me at the future high school stage," says Axel, who has also advanced in business studies.
A registry error has prevented world pollution from occurring
An error in a form of registration that people fill out when they come to the country caused an individual living in this country to be not called back to the biopsy.
A social security number is not required if the person fills the form in English, as is the case in English.
“ This will be examined this week, ” said one surgeon for the prevention field.
Three internal transmissions were identified at the National Hospital’s Antiviral Institute yesterday.
One of those who proved to be positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules of so - called world peace came into effect.
If you live in Iceland, you will be screened for coming to the country and again proclaimed in display four or five days later.
On the day - to - day news of RuV, however, the subject followed the old system.
The images on the border were negative, and they were not called back in the screening for the virus.
In a conversation with a news agency, Kamilla Ruth Sigfustótttótttóttor, an expert on the National Anti-Clinicist’s Disease Control Plant, says that this is caused by a error in the electronic registry.
If people fill out the form in English, it is not required to enter a social security number, as is the original English edition.
Although it was primarily thought of as foreign travelers.
Therefore, if the person has not received an automatic invitation to come to the biopsy.
Kamilla, however, says that many people have followed the rules of home safety, even though they filled the index form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to re-examine people after they arrived in the country.
“ This will be examined in the week how it can help people to make it easier to draw their attention to the process. ”
The man is in solitary confinement, and six have been put in a hospital.
They all go on display, but two had begun to display symptoms.
The three infections that were detected yesterday are currently in progress, which is largely completed by two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, a serial analysis by the Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that it has not been found in this field of crown virus.
In one case, the bond has been directed toward Israel, though it is known that the one who carried the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says there should be a date tomorrow when the other virus arrived.
All 15 are now in isolation according to the COVID.
135 are in sick condition.
Four of five non-infectious diseases
Five domestic transmissions have been identified in this country in the last few days.
Of these, four are unplugged and do not have the origin of the Rey Cup sports convention yesterday.
Implantation is still ongoing.
Originally, there were a third score of special passes to the disease, a reduced number of them to 16.
Overall, 34 are in an illness due to the new infections identified yesterday.
This is the second time during a brief period of outbreak of sporting events and has raised questions as to whether such events should be held.
John K. Jonsson, director of the U.S. Marshals Security Department, says that as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
“ We are constantly telling all who live here that individual barriers need to be maintained.
We also need to impress on people who are observing events that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
Then events can be held," says John.
He says that it can be prevented by promoting individual protection.
In addition, rules and standards are under constant review.
“ What must be done, and what the P.C. and the surgeon general are constantly urging people to do, is to consider these individual barriers.
Both at home and at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
This prevents the transmission of infectious diseases," says Jon.
“ We need to encourage people to continue on the good road trip we were on so that we can maintain the effectiveness we have so far. ”
40% of victims of VID-19 had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult it was for her father to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden respiratory distress due to a crown virus infection.
Diabetes was defined as an underlying problem, and Brumfield, also diabetic, is afraid that the same will happen to him.
Mr. Reuters of the press says the fear of Brumfield is not without reason.
The numbers of a new study conducted by the U.S. government show that less than 40% of patients with pre-existing diabetes 2 have pre-existing diabetes.
When the proportion of people who did not reach 65 years of age is examined, the ratio increases to one-half.
The CDC study included over 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the crown virus during the February through May.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC expert, says the results are striking, especially for those who have been diagnosed with diabetes and their loved ones.
Reuters ’ slow growth made a survey, pointing responses from the 12 countries that met comparable proportions.
10 countries, including California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet reporting underlying diseases.
“ There was already an epidemic in slow growth.
Now, the COVID 19 has broken through like a powerful wave," Reuters, by Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also fallen worse from the crown virus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes 2 is to control the condition by exercise, healthy diet, and the assistance of health care professionals.
However, the crown virus epidemic has made it difficult for many people to keep routines.
In this case, some people have had high insulin prices to keep coming to work and thus stopped being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risks that could be caused by the virus.
When SARS came across the virus in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and during the 2009 pig flu epidemic, this group had three times the risk of going to a hospital.
When MERS was observed in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted into intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, University of Yale, says that because the effect of the COVID-19 virus could be longer, the epidemic has removed the number of previously unknown complications.
“ I fear that we will see a tsunami of problems when this is over, ” says Andrew Bolton, director of a worldwide diabetic organization.
Doctors have warned that the crown virus epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new research may lead to an increase in the number of diabetic cases.
Reuters says that scientists are trying to understand the connection between the crown virus and the diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
A high rate of glucose and lipids in diabetics may then produce a true “cytokinstorm, ” as it is called when the immune system responds too strongly and attacks the body.
damage to endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation that can result in fatal blood clots.
“ It’s all one big puzzle, ” says Dela Cruz.
“ It all has to do with one another. ”
The story has been corrected.
"We were invited to champagne, then they left the room"
The couple Ásrún Magnótttótttir and Atli Bollon had the unusual request from an artist named Rnagri Kjartan son of Kjartan to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was putting up in Paris.
“ We loved each other, so it wasn’t complicated. ”
Therefore, Atli Bolton will never forget the first time he met his wife and mother, Ásrúnu Magnútótttir.
“ I was very impressed by her.
It was, of course, just the radiation, but then I also thought it was completely unorthodox.
And still seems," he says.
Ásrún remembers this too.
“ I keep hearing this story.
Last only this weekend," she says, who was also attracted to her husband’s first encounter.
“ I felt so excited about Atla, whom I like.
There's a lot going on and there's a lot going on, and I was fascinated by it."
Atli says that she and her husband emphasized the importance of going their own way.
“ We don’t tie our weights with tourists.
We avoid the routines that we see around us."
That is possible reason why they took the message from Richard Kjartan son of an art artist just rejoicing, though it was the least said unusual.
“ Christine Anna, our mutual friend, contacts us and asks us if we can come to eat desert with him, Raggga and Inggjörg's wife, Ragnars, on Snaps. ”
They accepted the invitation, met the trident at the Sinaps, and took the deservin and each one his dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans to the art show that he intended to install in Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
“ He had a multitask woodwork called Scenes freom westran culture.
He simply described it."
Ásrún says that he described it as a killer and a dekadent of Western everyday life.
“ He had sketches of all the scenery he was about to shoot, and last time he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating. ”
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show young middle classes to make love in a minimal room.
“ It’s intercourse with beginning and end, ” says Atli.
The couple did not know much of Ragnar, even though they knew about him and he did, “but they knew us and felt we fit.
They had a reputation that they refused to advertise.
Maybe they thought that they wouldn't get the right people, but people who got sexually involved with performing to others."
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“ When we were walking from Snakes, we said, ‘ Are we not just ready for this?
It was just like that.
I trust an artist and all his team, says Ásrún and Atli.
“ It Is About Love and Nearness ”
The scene was set up in a fine apartment on Myr Street.
There was a very ignorant movie team; a cameraman, Ragnar, and a musician, and the couple.
After the recording was on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
“ We had not decided what we should be like.
We got some instructions, but we tried to forget about the moment and place.
To be ignorant of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn't a game, we just loved each other, so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
“ Yes, it was a bit romantic, ” says Atli and Ásrún.
“ We were invited to have champagne before they left the room.
It was a little bit like being on vacation at a fancy hotel in Paris."
The team was happy with the couple’s performance in the work that moved them.
“ When Tommi saw this, ” says Atli, “he wept.
“ It’s as much about love as about getting close as it does about sex, ” says Ásrún.
The couple’s parents have seen the job, telling Atli that his mother heard the voice of the son in the Index, and they realized that he was part of the project.
“ Then she turns around and starts thinking about it, ” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that, but then my dad sends me a message and says, "It's nice to run into the little family in Palau de Tokyo," he recalls Ásrún.
And would the participation in the project have deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atla?
“ At least we’re still together, so maybe it got deeper.
At least it deepened my relationship with the family in law," says Ásrún and laughs.
Ásrún herself saw the project in Copenhagen with his colleagues.
“ I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else, ” she says and turns to her husband.
“ But it was nice to see this because it's just one scene in a much bigger job, and when you saw it with the other, it's really cool.
I was a little out of it and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with one of the partners when the scene was taken up.
“ It was just beautiful. ”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrún and Atla in Australian History of Channel 1.
Swansea with victory in the first semi-final game

Then, Andre Ayew added the crappy mess by scorein' a great goal and ensured Swansea's victory 1–0.
So Swansea leads 1–0 in the duel, but the second game takes place on the next Wednesday at Brentford home.
Five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the American ambassador in Iceland, is in the flash media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard who was afraid of his life.
However, it has not been without difficulty for the president of the United States to appoint ambassadors in this country.
Since the death of U.S. ambassador Carol Van Voorst in April 2009, there have been no more than five years of ambassadors in the country for 62 months.
Van Vorst was deputized in a peculiar setting, but Cast Light reported on 2009 that she should have received the falcon.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a phone call from the Oval Office that she would not be honored.
After she left Iceland, she taught international communication with Army War College.
After 16 months, Van Voorst’s successor arrived in September 2010.
To some extent, Robert S. Connan was appointed as ambassador but then withdrew.
Finally, for decades, Loius Ariega had served in the foreign service.
Then, in the fall of 2013, he retired and took over the office of ambassadors in Guatemala.
Then another unprecedented era took over.
In January 2015, Robert Barber received the approval of the U.S. Congress and arrived shortly thereafter, when no ambassador had been present for 13 months.
Barber was a politically appointed but not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's election fund.
On January 20, 2017, as usual, Donald Trump took over the presidency, with politicalally appointed ambassadors.
Trump’s rule took an extraordinary length of time to appoint both ambassadors and high government officials in Washington.
Thus, two years passed before the U.S. Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him questions from the platform and confirm that he was serving as an ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony to a council, he said that he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been of the Dutch echoes.
Gunter, a former California dermal surgeon, has been prominent in the Republis Party of Jews, the Republiblican Jewish Coalition.
The gambling owner Sheldon Adelson founded this organization, but Adelson is a zealous supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to serve in Iceland in May 2019, when no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, the longest of which is here.
The reason is not only how long Trump was appointing people in key positions but also that in recent years the U.S. Congress has been very long won, including validating ambassadors in office.
So since 2009 the total number of ambassadors in Iceland has been clear for over five years.
However, this has not thwarted the operation of the embassy that recently opened headquarters at Entöttor.
The projects are thought to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the fenced security walls surround the building and the trunk glass is in all windows.
However, it seems that this was not enough to fill the present ambassador’s sense of security, for he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
IBV former player suffered racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former director of the IBV, claims he suffered from racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets having come to the country.
This is presented in an interview with Tonny, who appeared on the Ugranda Media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team playing in the top division of Uganda.
During the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny discussed many things, including his time in the country, but he played with IBV, Val, and India.
“ When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The team's captain was in that position, but in addition he also had the tare number I wanted, so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny, but he played on the right side of the season with IBV.
Among the things Tonny talks is racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem many black players experience when they play in Europe.
“ This once happened to me, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the case, and I asked my friend what it was about.
He then told me that after I shredded him, my opponent had a racist comment about me. "
In 2014, Tonny from Iceland went to Norway, where he joined Haguek.
There he says that he made the mistakes he sees most in his life.
Tonny had not been able to get to Hagueunde, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to return to Iceland on loan, but he joined Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland on loan.
I think if I'd stayed in Norway, I'd have had the chance I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped if he was gonna play well in Norway, he'd probably get longer.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has destroyed his dreams of getting into Europe's majors.
Found a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, found 3.8 pounds of black worm in the neck of a woman who searched for it.
The doctor was able to pull the worm out with a tunnel.
A study revealed that parasites were involved.
CNN reports this.
The woman had eaten sashim a few days earlier, a thin piece of meat.
The woman soon got better after the worm was removed, but parasites like these are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi squeezed into the Western world, there has been an increase in cases where parasites have spread to people, according to CNN.
Fear that other wave is about to start in Europe
Spain is now focused on the concern of another wave of the crown virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to reverse the spread of the crown virus.
In Katalonia, all entertainment has been placed on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona, where there is an increasing number of infectious agents.
Other European countries have also taken action because of the increase in infection in Spain, but in Britain, all have to go to a hospital for the return from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned of travel to Spain.
It is also increasing in France and Germany, where governments try to balance the spread of the virus and restore the economy.
However, Europe’s situation is good compared with other countries, but the incidence of global transmission is nearly 300 thousand per day, where America and South Asia are most infected.
As confirmed by Johns Hopkins University, 16 million are worldwide, and deaths confirmed to be related to the virus are now 6,44 thousand.
In time, the Mosaic Law will have the privilege of fully enjoying itself.
In front of the Toll House in Reykjavík, there's a big, deep hole.
It's got orange helmets on top of it.
There's a big dig, too.
And more smaller machinery.
The street is blocked by traffic.
But the sidewalk is good, and many stop there and observe the work of millions of masosaces — as though they had never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At any rate, they did not consider it.
The job has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of the parking lot that was always besieged.
People parked there, locked their car in a snack, and then jumped off to business in the center of the city.
The modern - day “biological and diverse areas of the public ” and“ aggravating cities ” are guided by the reconstruction of Today’s Tryggie Street.
The objective is to enhance the beauty of the area and allow the mosaic painting of the Helgadods at Toll House to have a better vision.
The work becomes a public square, and where the area is comfortable with the sun, it is considered to be suitable for road users to stay.
The work of art will be illuminated, and now the wood will be able to enjoy it better than on these 142 square feet [142 sq m] surfaces.
There will also be small “dragons ” in the area, a kind of watery pool that offers a game and puts the area into a unique mystery.
In this way, the reforms are described by the city of Reykjavík, which is in progress, as well as by hosts.
Water supply, heat company and power grid will be replaced.
Many of these are in their early teens, but the sewage and cooling laws have since 1925 served people and businesses in downtown areas for nearly a century.
When the street is re-opened, cars can drive around it again.
But it becomes a single street, and at the same time it creates more quiet and accessible space for walking.
In a news game about the Toll House on the customs manager’s website, the house was used in 1971 by the architect Gísli Halldorsson.
Because the waterfront covered the building, there were 250 square feet [250 sq m] of window - free wall walled to the side of the street.
Architects and architects agreed that such a surface would adversely affect the overall street picture, if not made special arrangements to adorn the appearance of the house.
Thus, members agreed to calculate by having it installed a permanent art of art.
At that time, a lot of the work of an artist, the Helga daughter, was made.
She had worked very hard in masican arts in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was to first contact her before deciding whether to compete for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work had to be mirrored at the dock, as the port had been living in a life - style since it was made.
When talking to an artist, she had to step in on such a task.
It had to be agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, where she would work with the suggestions abroad.
When she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
Without delay, the decision was made to ask her to do the job.
At the same time, the brothers Oidtmann, who had long served alongside them in the setting up of famous arts throughout Europe, were asked to make an overall agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany.
Contracts took place, and they prepared the art of art for the installation of the workshop of the brothers, who then arranged for the setup of the Toll House.
The work was extremely well solved, both by the actions of the Helga daughter and Oidtmann brothers, says in the summary.
Ever since then, this has been the case of an Icelandic pledge.
It took about two years to do the work that was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
Two years after the Toll House was finished, only 47 years old, the artist died.
Preparing to export more institutions to land
As Ásmundur Einar Daddason announces that more government agencies will be exported to land in the near future.
That's what the minister of the show said, "President" at the Penis at lunchtime.
The burning field of Húnar and Engineers has recently been reported to be moving north in the Gulf of Sheep in the fall.
There are six fire - management experts at the Agency, but none of them intend to follow the Institute of the North and the National Association of Fire and Drug Administration, critical of the transport processors.
“ I think we should take a further step into this creature.
I'm preparing for a further step into this creature.
Further transport," said Ásmundur.
He claims to be convinced that the great majority of the people want to see a greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
“ I think there is a need to make further political decisions about the transfer of public services to the country, as I was doing with the House and Engineer Organization," said Ásmundur, but he also took an example of other institutions that have been exported to land and that have been important for communities abroad, such as the transport of food to Selfos, Iceland's national recommendations to Akraness and unemployment insurance on the Skaga coast.
The Second Day of the Masters' Day
Iceland's Free Sports Championship ended at Thorsfield in Akureyri today.
Several convention records were set on the second day of the race.
An exciting race was calculated for women in the Battle Zone, while Vigdis Jónsdóttt from FH put Iceland's record in a fight in 2014, until IR's daughter Elizabeth Runars improved last May.
Vigdis won Iceland's record back earlier this summer and has been in fads lately, but she's tripled Iceland's worth of summer.
Today, Elizabeth Ruth has been dealing with injuries and has not recovered.
She only had one hit of five, threw 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdis threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and set a convention record.
Her Iceland record she put earlier in July is 62.69 meters, so it was a bit of a thing.
Guðrún Karitas Hallgrimdótttir from IR had the second best attack of the day, but she improved her best success with a seizure of 50,18 meters.
In a male group, the FH-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-T-E-T-E-M-M-M-E-M-M-E-M-E-M-E-L-E-T-E-L-E-L-E-T, he hit 7-3,4-foot-foot-foot-foot-foot-to-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-m.
His assessment in this article is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valður Guðnason, Olympics, and the Icelandic holder in a round shot won a ball-cast at the Thorsfield yesterday, but today he was racing in a pretzel race, which is his major piece.
Iceland's Guðna Vals is 65.53 meters, who threw out the longest of 59.13 yards today to secure his victory.
This afternoon, Valdimar Hjaltli Sjörððursson, who had one valid attack that worked at 2nd place, was 40.43 feet [49.43 m].
Majöðurdóttir, a long-fliped evangelist in Iceland, won the long-fingered jumper at 6,25 meters today, nearly 40 cm from her Iceland record.
In the women's 200-yard race, it was the IR Guðbjörgón Bjarnadóttir, who came at the finish line in 24.04 seconds, whose Iceland record in this article is 23.45 seconds.
Gudbjörgo was victorious in Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, a 100 - foot [100 m] race, and a 4 x 100 - meter race today as well as a 4 x 400 - meter race.
In a male group, Kolbeinn Höður, from FH, was first in a 200 - foot [200 m] race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Ilver Maurna Samuel’s son.
Like Gudbjón, Sir Francis won gold in the 100 meter yesterday, as well as in the 400 - meter race.
Can't get a ticket for $27 million Bitcoin crop
The head tax board has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who demanded a fine for the failure of the financial income produced by the sale of Bitcoin.
The committee concluded that a tax investigator had not given clear reasons for the need to fine the man.
The decision made by the Committee indicates that the taxorist felt that the man was responsible for false tax returns due to the year 2016 and 2017 of income.
He would have underestimated his financial income, which would have been due to the sale of Bitcoin’s electric coin of 27 million, either on purpose or of the marvelous inert.
The man was to be fined for his ways.
The man turned it down in a letter to the committee.
However, he struggled to sell $27 million by 2016.
It would have been buried in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and unsolved by a conventional home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electric coin, the tax on such sales had been extremely vague and unpredictable.
It would have been possible to expect citizens to recognize such tax arrangements.
He would not have planned to avoid paying taxes from the harvest and would have made clear his property in terms of currency.
He would have asked both the professionals and the governor about how this was done but in vain.
Then he felt that he would have to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and would have lived here for only a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
So he would have been in a worse position than others to learn of complex rules that would not have been made clear to him by the tax authorities.
So the man rightly felt that his taxes for those two years of income would be repealed and stressed, but otherwise they would not be punished.
Then he repeated that he worked in Iceland and would have paid taxes in this country since 2012.
He would never have planned to give in to his responsibilities in an irreverent way.
The claim of guilt was out of balance and would result in debt.
Introducing professor: “This man understands what football is ”
The Master Andersen Willumsson has been quite a contrast between the teeth of people, but also impressed by the success of his career with the Pepsi Max Gang.
Balls will be in the fireline tonight when they receive IA live on station 2 Sport.
A broiler takes them out for four notices during the season and does not come to the game with a new haircut, as in the summer’s games so far.
He had had written “blah, blah, blah, blah ” on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“ I don’t know exactly who he was replying to, but speaking about character, this one was actually trying the game.
He didn't go underground.
He wants the ball every single time, and if there was someone going to level this game, I thought he'd do it or make it," said Guðmundur Benedictsson in the Pepsi Max Lodge, when it came to the Bryjolf.
“ I'm supposed to be here for the people. ”
“ It’s hard sometimes to figure out what his position is.
He looks a little out on the left when the games begin, but he's got a very free football team," said Helrvar Havelson.
The villagell Moon Petersson says Brynjólf is a real entertainer and rejoices to receive such a colorful member of the department: “No one cares about it being a character.
It's a fun type, and I love it with my hair, and always be ready to attend and answer in interviews.
There's an amazing lot of people wrapped up in him, that tells me that this man understands what football is.
“ I am an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy them."
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjolf, people are paying their way in, and they're watching what's next on their hair.
This man is just a genius," said moon.
Player KR says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in contact with a few teams in the B section"
Tobias Thomsen, director of the KR in Pepsi Max League, appears to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish psychic Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get the start of the season in his homeland, but for that, he has to cancel his contract at KR, where the Danish League starts before the Icelandic odds.
The Society knows I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“ I have been in contact with several teams in the B and will probably switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can afford to pay my contract at KR."
Then he says that he will likely have to take on a loss of pay in Denmark.
“ In Denmark, legislation has probably experienced more economic effects than in Iceland. ”
In a study of DV, the shepherd Bjartmar has recovered his bike for millions of responses now
For over a year Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He sniffs up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric wheels, and scooters.
Has Bjartmar gained the name “The Wheel Winger ” as a result.
Yesterday, when a man published a story about his relationship with Bjartmar, he found quite a stir.
Then, in your conversation with DV on the West Side of Facebook, it was noted that Bjartmar took the man to speak in the East and said that the scooter may be stolen.
It was only possible to read from the original writing of the electric pentant that Bjartmar could have written it as a thief.
This text has now been modified on Facebook and the title of the original DV news updated accordingly.
Bjartmar tells the original news about the case at all does not describe what actually went on yesterday in the East.
Bjarttar said that he had received information from a victim of electronic arts that he truly was his electric shuttle.
This information was obtained by an alleged owner, but the information was wrong, says Bjartmar.
“ I saw the guy, and I recognized the shuttle, with information that it was an electric shuttle that had been missing very long and searched for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him get ready to get off at the shuttle, I decide to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I do very well in this matter: but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the floor from me."
Bjarttar says that the man on the generator immediately invited him to show him the receipt for his bike, and he himself called the police.
“ Yeah, cool, ” Bjartmar said, “let's get this straight.
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric pen and started off.
Later, the right owner of the electric shuttle told of his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous story.
During this more than the year Bjartmar has pursued this practice, he says he can count the times he faced with people’s fingers on one hand.
“ I’ve had peaceful relations with the toughest men in Reykjavík, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are often the smallest brothers and sisters in the community, addicts, pristine people, and other people for some reason on the street.
“ The body is a tough master, and somehow the next dose must be financed, unfortunately stealing on such cash is an easy way to achieve that goal, ” says Bjartmar.
“ My dealings with these people are really so good that I have many good people with me.
Some people have gone to treatment and settled down and then come to me and help me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmars is dealing with bicycles on polite terms.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, wheel numbers, and so forth.
A major problem that has been discussed is bicycle theft.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even telling people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjarggars disagrees with the previous DV newscast and claims that they are not some sort of self-organized police in a personal search for justice.
When asked whether he has not come to the ice with his actions, and whether this is not the main role of police, Bjartmar says it is.
“ Of course the police are supposed to do this, but the fact is that the police are simply not doing this.
I've got to watch the police drive away from a big pile of stolen wheels.
She's very direct about these matters."
“ When the cops aren’t doing anything about it, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this media class, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says that he was so successful in tracking stolen wheels that sometimes he found his “stoes ” on the street that they just had the right wheels they had once recovered.
The time Bjartmar has called for police assistance has occurred when she simply won’t be there.
“ It’s not just the police, and it's not my fault, and it's not my fault, ” said Bjartmar, and is sorry that victims of bicycle thieves have to suffer the indifference of police in this media class.
The success of Bjartmars is not shared.
In many places, there are stories of people who thank Bjartmer for having returned to them.
In fact, Bjartmar himself says that the number of bicycles he has returned has long lost, but the amount is probably running in millions, if not millions of dollars.
Road there is heavy electric vests, electric wheels, and electric tanks, but an electric wheel can cost up to half a million dollars.
Bjarttar works day by day in nursery school, and every other weekend he works as a roommate.
So his bicycle search is unpaid work that he does during his spare time.
Penitentiary and Long Shadows
In 2019 there was a great birthday year in the history of pensions in Iceland.
True, the officials had received a pension from King Dana all the streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 the official pension fund, which eventually became the pension fund for all government officials.
The basis for the current pension fund for public employees was then laid with all the labour agreements in a labour market in 1969, where a job - related pension fund with responsibilities and responsibilization was set up from the early 1970 ’ s.
Then, in 1974, laws were passed on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to doubt thereafter.
The slave’s pension system was not the only radical change brought about by the labor movement of the 20th century.
In 1955, unemployment insurance had been similarly won in historic strike campaigns, and the organization gradually got its requirements for illness and medical supplies, considerable holiday rights, short hours of work, housing reforms, and so forth.
All of these rights cost a lot of hard fighting but proved to be superior, much more permanent, than an increase in the amount of money in the pay fight, which disappeared just as hard in the inflation that characterized the period after war and until 1990, as many remember.
In 1969, the planner for the establishment of a civilian pension fund was both long and complex.
Although the funds were finally agreed to be in effect owned by a fundmate, the labor movement had to agree that their governments were to be appointed representatives of employers and treasure partners.
During the following years after the fund’s establishment, the demand for a majority of fund workers was often for discussion in an organization of employees, but it was never available, so we still have an abnormal arrangement that funds are not represented by the majority in the management of the funds.
Article 36 of law 129/1997 on the duty of pensions and the function of pension funds is discussed in the fund’s investment policy.
The figure 1 says that “a saving treasure should guide a partner’s interests. ”
It also says in the 5th paragraph: “A pension fund should set moral standards in investments. ”
The stockholderal policy of the Penitentiary Fund includes the following provisions, following the above laws:
The pension fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) guidelines for responsible investments, as well as many of the largest pensions and institutions in the West and Europe.
The rules discuss how the emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as on good management of enterprises can contribute to improved investment costs.
In this way the interests of investors and social objectives are linked in a broader context.
LV considers it important that enterprises, especially those registered in the stock market, establish a public policy on: that we have good administrative measures as a social responsibility and environment.
The largest fund in the country’s economy has established “a policy of responsible investments, ” which is similar to that.
It's all referred to here as the introduction to Icelandic's latest fashion, "shade management".
Since the word is new, there is no hope that it was defined fully, but it seems to me now that the following definition is “highest ”: Shadow management is when a member of a union says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the Society to the management of a pension fund or instructions on how to take sides on a particular matter.
If they do not follow the instructions, they will be relieved of the government at their first convenience.
However, if the leader does not say this in the media and does not speak of resignation, it is not “shade control, ” for there is such communication between people, of course, always in the financial world as there are other people.
I'll let the reader think about which way he feels is more “darker. ”
In particular, there are two men who have tried to shape this definition when this is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
It's Herr Aurgisson, a reporter for the newspaper and Ásgeir Jonsson.
The purpose of both came after the Bogdi Bogason president of Icelandair had told of his intention to break the agreements of the airline with stewards and stewards (telling them), and Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, president of the trade company in Reykjavík, sent them out to represent the Society in the Management Board of Penitentiaries not to support the potential purchase of stocks in the community, or they might be dismissed.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, followed by Ragnar Thor, who, of course, considered the decision of Boga.
Nevertheless, on Friday’s newspaper, they saw Hordur and Ásgeir as a basis for debate on the subject with a strong comment on espionage, law violations, and a great need for change in law.
There, indeed, would be a small challenge to reflect a heavy load, though your blessing had been in a subjunctive manner, as well as a sudden drought.
Since the matter is important, consider the end of the matter itself.
I ran here before the issue of the law on the pension fund involved in this case.
This includes the use of funds to protect the interests of funds partners and to have moral standards in investments, and these factors are further developed in the approval of both the value and the savings of traders, as I mentioned.
Life - saving funds, however, are NOT to look for only short - term profits in their investments.
Such a course would be a very dangerous course and need not be long searched for examples of such things in the past, where big bank loans and deposits have been passed on to immoral adventurers and environmental vandals, with tragic consequences.
The director of Icelandair was evidently on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly minimizing the favor the Society has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position toward investors.
Fortunately, he saw it and pulled it back.
Time will tell whether it will be sufficient for the partner’s investment to be considered responsible for the NGOs at the end of the day.
A former professor of physics and science.
One of the contaminants did not bring world pollution
One of the three identified by Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the Baltic State on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
However, he was not a regular Icelander, so he did not receive clear counsel that after arrival we have so - called conspiracies on arrival and on other samples a few days after arrival.
He got negative from a screen at the border.
“ But he's in Icelandic society, and he's really supposed to take that out, ” says Kamilla Josepsdóttor, a specialist in the Center for Disease Control, and a surrogate surgeon while he's on vacation, in a conversation with the newspaper today.
“ He used the English registration form, and it is not mandatory to record the social security number, and if the number is not registered, you are not automatically declared in the second view. ”
She says that the English registration form could have been used by the man because he's actually living abroad, but because of his network on the land that Icelander should have used it rather Icelandic.
He didn't realize, though.
“ When the social security number is not registered, you need to reach out for yourself for the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized it was the right way," says Kamilla.
“ So it is clear that we need to increase the information supply on this while we find some way to make an automatic preaching system, although the Icelanders do not record their social security numbers.
Or, somehow, it's more obvious who are Icelandic participants in the registration system," she explains.
Happily, though, few were associated with the individual when he arrived in the country, although he is defined as a member of the Icelandic community, a resident.
Only after being diagnosed yesterday have six been sent to the hospital, and these six were all associating with him.
They're going to take samples, but two of them are showing the symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative view at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says that he was recently infected with the virus that it could not yet be detected when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the spread of the virus in Iceland but does not carry it to her country.
“ It is not quite possible to claim that this is a certain introduction of infection because it is a long time ago that he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like those two people who have caused a little air in connection with the sporting contests. ”
Yet, it says that it is very unlikely because of the few people around us.
“ It’s really unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but stated that it cannot be ruled out until the human virus has been serialized by Icelandic genetic analysis.
“ If we get a virus file that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain he carried it to the country. ”
Piparpes and Bombs venerated Protestants
There was a conflict between police and Protestants in Seattle last night.
Police used Protestant pepper sprays and unscathed hand grenades, but Protestants broke windows and set fire.
45 Protestants were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot to death.
As stated on the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands met in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city’s courthouse.
As a result, police said the protest was a riot, and there was a conflict between Protestant and police groups.
In Aurora, Colorado, Eliah McCluin, a 23 - year - old black man who was murdered by a police officer last year, was remembered by Protestants.
A car drove through a Protestant group in the city, but nobody was hurt.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black Guards met and demanded justice for Brenonnu Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman murdered by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and joined the ranks of closed roads, where police were related to the group of protesters who also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man killed by a white barmate in May.
Sollay: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjöma, soccer director of Manchester United, does not want to make too much out of the importance of the game with Leicster today in the final tour of the English league.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, end of Solkajana and his men in fifth place, and thereby loses off the Masters tab.
Then they should still hope to get into the Master’s League by winning the next month’s European League.
“ We haven’t reached the end point yet.
If we make a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad period," said Solkajana.
“ But whatever happens, this isn’t the end of our journey because we still have a lot of land to catch the two joints above us, ” said Solkjana.
It is evident that at 15 p.m. today, human nerves will be filled, but Solkjana tried to act as if it were one other game.
“ If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure during the last game of the season.
It's nothing new, and on this it's based.
We've created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it's ours to use it," said Solkajana.
“ It’s not the most important game in the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone who's playing football, the next game is always the most important.
The result doesn't define our season. We've already had many hours to define this period."
“ Bruno Fernandes made a big difference for us, and I believe that a brain is in better shape and is much stronger spiritually than in the last period, ” said Solles.
65,000 infections per 24 hours
At the University of John Hopkins, 65,490 new infections were identified in the United States yesterday.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the western seas since the beginning of the pandemic in that country.
900 deaths were caused by the virus last night, but over the last four days, there were more than 1,000 deaths caused by the virus.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, according to a model of the U.S. antipollution authorities, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 on the second August 15.
Fear of the second pandemic wave
The government in Spain may now try to keep the country from spreading VID ≤19.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID ≤19 on both Thursday and Friday.
No more have been identified within 24 hours of early May, and reports begin at the same time as the Spanish begin to lift one of the most strict curfews in Europe.
As a result, Britain’s authorities now obliged passengers who come from Spain to go to the hospital on their way home.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of secure kingdoms.
The situation is worst in Katalonia, the northeastern part of Spain, where governments have resorted to more extensive restrictions in order to try to stop the growth.
In the capital city, Barselona will be closed for two weeks, and the waves will close at midnight.
Then there's a curfew for 200 thousand people in Segria County, west of Katalonia.
It is estimated that Britain’s decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is highly angry with foreign tourists and who are mismanaged after the epidemic.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel agency, canceled all the flights scheduled today for Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to prepare for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in the return to the vast industry that has destroyed the economy in many places.
For example, British prime minister Boris Johnson has taken very seriously such things as nuclear weapons he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, the prime minister of France, has said that the nation would “not survive, economic or socially, ” if the exiles again were taken on a national scale.
Many advisers hope to have local resources that reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities, or areas will be able to hold back the virus if they do.
Five new infections in Iceland - three inland
Three domestic transmissions were detected yesterday as well as two in addition to the border.
That's how five people with a positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
A P.R. announcement states that one of the infections was related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP soccer convention.
He has been sent into solitary confinement, and sixteen who were close to him were in a sick condition.
The infected person was a member of a sports club in Reykjavík or a member of the “just Part of the Sports Team ” in a buggy.
Others who were sent to the sick are connected in another way.
The source of this infection is unrecognised and fully infected by the government's infectious team.
The ReyCUP delegates have followed the instructions and rules of the physician’s contraception and existing public protection, and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of the convention caught sight of a very close community being seen celebrating their good team in the field.
Just before 11: 00 p.m., Assembly Keepers present the following notifications on their Facebook page.
It says: “ATH: Parents, please respect the rules for contestants to pick up their own things at school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday but was related to the infection reported last day.
The announcement states: “Incessal genetic analysis has been diagnosed with the transmission of the virus and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been previously identified."
This case is also infected with isolation, and 12 are infected with disease because of infection.
The third issue is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
It was discovered in the southwest corner of the country.
The person is now in isolation and six who were close to him in a sick condition.
Two of them are already showing signs of virus infection.
In addition, two were identified at the border and are waiting for the results of further studies, such as cross-border transmission procedures.
Finally, the announcement says: The U.S. Marshal’s Human Protection Unit and the General’s office encourage people to exercise caution and take care of individual protection.
In view of the presence of the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus, the same person is asked to take samples at the nearest clinic.
Loreks Bay says the tent area is booked on business weekends -- direct guests elsewhere
As reported in the West, the district of Patrekjörður is completed this weekend.
When visitors are directed to look at other accommodations.
The Committees of the West Park Valley, Tokjar, Melanes of Red Sea, Hotel Flolund, and Hotel Bredorvík as alternatives to the situation.
There's plenty to be on the Patrek's Eve this weekend, because as in the previous year, Turtle City will be held in the town for the festival of Icelandic documentarys.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in town.
For example, the attendance at the tent area can be expected this year, if the weather does not add up in an account, but DV said earlier today about the inevitable forecast.
But we can expect the worst weather south, and hope for the Patressors.
The Web first told about it, saying that all other rooms in this town were already fully booked.
A whole apartment building grows to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free on Dungna 18-20.
In the meantime, owners seek permission to reform, but their mission has been successful in the system for the past 3 years.
At one of the oldest and most glorious towns in Reykjavík, there is a three - story apartment building.
On the ground floor of the house, there is a shopping area of some 600 square feet [600 sq m].
At the back of the house are the doors of two stairs, each holding four quite glorified apartments.
They range from 93–130 square metres, most of which are over 100.
The house has quite a story.
It was built in 1959, and it has included a video store, the schoolroom, the milk store of the L.A., the Jóa gunkeeper, the fish market, and now the last college printer.
The house has, to speak with tenderness, its luxury beauty.
As you can see in the accompanying pictures, the building now has severe damage.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf are according to a company record among Michael Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lakrusdóttir.
Marcus went before the city’s owners ’ group, and he was the chairman of the City property community.
In the group of the owners of the City Owners, there is a steel ship ehf.
A steel ship ehf is an investment partner for Guðrúr Helga Lárasdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third in D18 hf.
Guðrún and her husband, Augustus Guðmundur’s son, once fired the extinct Steeler.
During the summer of 2009, D18 ehf bought the house, and it has little to do with it since then.
Tell neighbors that the situation of the house has continued to deteriorate since, most of all, in recent years.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood, one resident says that the house was “not very animated last year. ”
It may be playing in that the owners have been seeking to change the house and property for several years.
Other neighbors say that the house has been out of control for a long time.
“ It's a long time to do something nice to this spot and boring that it's like this. ”
At the same time, he says that he is pissed off at the house’s owners for not wanting to finish this, finding some common ground with his neighbors, and stopping this “law. ”
“ Just do it together with society, so you can get on with it and finish it. ”
The “Latter ” referred to is the organizational process of the cell that has been in progress at least since 2017.
After permission to build a hill on the top of the present apartment house and behind the house, a new elevator house, and one floor and a basement, the owners of Dungnague 18 and 20 became afraid.
The building permits issued for this project were charged with the Environmental and Resource Commission and ruled it out as a failure to support the work in a divided organization and a nearby presentation was inadequate.
The city of Reykjavík then started sharing organized work and completed it by advertising in July last year.
That organization was also sullied, and the committee canceled it in March 2020.
So at this point, nearly three years had passed from the original construction license application and the houseowners in the first place.
At that time, the house had dropped considerably, and neighbors began to tire out.
When DV asked neighbors about the situation and neighbors ’ reaction, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the house, others not at all.
Others directed their anger toward the city, and others didn't.
Others were just angry, but nothing was necessarily involved.
Still others said the parking lots were bickering, while neighbors have a new unused parking lot under their vehicles of 18-20.
One of the accusers in the case said that the administration was a long-lost man:
“ The fact that we have to go through the process three times is amazing.
It's like the city of Reykjavík can't read."
Today the house stands empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A monument to the kultanium of the city’s administration and the noble plans for the owner and many years of work of those who are now in the early stages.
When a journalist arrived at Dungla 18, you were confronted with a door open and heaped with garbage.
Another piece of junk on the earth — victims of Icelandic summer cowards — was produced by Playstation and by a recent TV.
The old college printer’s office was opened to a considerable number of cats of the urine smell.
Clearly, someone has nested in one corner, but no one is visible.
Letters of couches and beds and several boards of geology pages, doubtless meant to become a book, were alarmed.
At the same time, the challenges of the apartment were open and life in both.
A reporter was so lucky to run into the people of one of them.
While there, Romanians scavenged their potatoes for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the Ztrongforce ehf employee.
They have been there for some time and have reported DV's records that the company has been paid nothing but heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, rent is not predictable.
It is clear from the busy post at the front door of the house that there have been a number of foreign workers living there during the last few years.
The performance of employees' lair has not been a part of the Covid-19 situation, as the migration of tourism led to reductions in the construction sector, and these two companies have been the most successful use of the staff's services.
Nevertheless, after long hours in the rain, domestics in Dungna 18 seemed to have enough work to do, and the damaged work slots and poor people in their partnerships seemed to dry up.
It should be noted that despite the miserable state of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be quite maintained.
When a journalist said good - bye to the boys in Romanian, his sarcasm became clear: At the best place in Reykjavík, a house of 1,500 square feet [1,500 sq m].
Owners want to change the house for the better, and neighbors want to make things better, but they argue over the definition of improvement.
In between, the city’s organizational area is situated at its starting point, the victim of endless appeals and bug reports in the planning process and the hangover resolutions of the Commission on Environment and Resources.
In the house, there are so Romanian workers, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in the July 17th weekend newspaper of DV.
In a campaign against overweight following a crown virus epidemic
Britain’s prime minister Boris Johnson will provide 10 million pounds of campaign against overweight, which will include the ban on fast - food advertising, following his serious illness, partly because of his weight.
It says Johnson presents the campaign, which has been promised better health tomorrow, Monday, but during the campaign doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycle rides for their clients to overweight and will also be attacked by the rise of bicycle tracks.
Then, according to British media authorities, commercials on TV will be banned by 21 p.m.
“COVID-179 has awakened us to the short and long - term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use the time to become more healthy, more active, and eat healthy foods," has been quoted by a government official’s spokesman.
Johnson himself has had a weight problem, but he was admitted to intensive care when he was infected with the crown virus in the spring, which is partly because of his weight that he is believed to have become so seriously ill.
Women better to lead the changes
She said that the new constitution is the biggest step that the nation can take toward greater authority, transparency, and the challenge of working against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“ We need to change gear a little now, and who is better able to produce such changes than the group of society that has a better place in those values?
There are women," said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their role as women.
To stick together and to be together in making changes.
So now it's just our turn to make these changes."
She said she was a little concerned about the emphasis on Iceland as "best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
“ Then we will not be as ready to see what needs to be done.
Like Germans, we are very conscious of their history and of everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and knowing the story and listening to it.
Listen to the voices of decapitated groups.
We don't all have the same rules here," said Helga.
When asked, she said that women are in many respects in good business in Iceland, but she added that, as in many other lands, Icelanders lived with extreme male values.
She said that politics turned to promote personal interests, authority, and authority as the forces that preserved discrimination in all communities.
“ Women have already formed this group and gathered together, and they are just getting a little frustrated at the idea that the U.S. Congress is going to climb to the top of this nation’s vote from 2012, ” she said.
“ That’s what we're thinking about.
From human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table," she said, adding that the above values were the values in the new constitution.
“ We are a very rich country of natural dependency, and it’s absurd that we have people who live in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change different," said Helga.
“ It’s ridiculous that there is something natural in nature that women’s activities are always less paid.
It's ridiculous that stewardessses and nurses have to stand up in a box fight forever just to get a decent salary."
The signature list for the new constitution can be signed here via electronic Iceland.
Tried to rob a walking roadfarer downtown
A man was arrested in the downtown town last night after he threatened walking road users and tried to get money from him.
Police also stopped the production of drugs in Aartown, where two were arrested for the matter.
Then the police stopped a motorcycle driver in the slopes, where a driver was at a speed of 146 miles [ 146 km] at a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been stripped of his driving rights.
Police in the capital city had enough to turn into a night, and more than 80 cases were listed in a police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
Then there was an especially high level of noise announcements.
Saturday afternoon afternoon, reports of 11 noisy parties were received, and it was a big deal in police diary.
Last night, however, 22 noises were reported on by police officers.
Six were saved in a prison cell last night.
Last night, police were called up when the party launched fireworks.
Yet, they had run away when police officers came in.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped for drunks and drug driving.
Four were arrested because of a fight in downtown town last night, one of which was saved in a prison cell.
Then two were taken to the emergency room after they fell on the face, one in the downtown town, and the other in the West.
One was transferred to the emergency room after he was injured jumping on trampoline in Kopavogi.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who pulled a trailer in Kjalarnesi yesterday.
The trailer hardware, according to the police diary, was in “very bad condition, ” and was held in place.
It's possible to stay in the Monet's house on business weekends.
The house in which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last 40 years of his training is now rent on the Airbnb page.
The next available night in the house is shopping weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry, Normandie, France.
World - famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If anyone intends to rent this house, he must rent at least two nights.
Based on Airb's page it's next available after week, on Sunday of the shopping weekend, and therefore may be ideal for some shopkeepers on vacation to hurry to book the painter's house.
The two nights of shopping weekends cost only 964 U.S. dollars or more than 130,000 U.S. dollars as the newspaper nears its arrival.
Some of them start to display the symptoms of the disease caused by the crown virus.
In the last three days, five have been identified with the domestic crown virus, most of which are uninfected.
Because of this, dozens of people have become chronically ill, and some of them start to display the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were identified with the internal crown virus yesterday, and two were in border order.
According to one surgeon in office, rising numbers of domestic transmissions do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading into the community.
“ The virus has not been seen here before, so we have no special reason to believe that it has been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived, but, of course, we need to be very careful now," said Dr. Chemilla Sigriður, a specialist in the Department of Defense.
Most of these infections have been associated with individuals who came from abroad.
Further demonstrations will be held in the near future, but some associated with them are beginning to display symptoms of the crown virus.
“ There is no flu and there is no other respiratory infection, so we can be quite liberal by doing these tests in individuals who during fluenctuate time had found reason to do something else first, ” said Kamilla.
Implantation is largely complete, but it is not excluded that more people have to get picked up.
After attending sporting events, two of the infected were diagnosed.
Has such an event raised questions?
The P.R. communication manager says well as long as people follow guidelines and regulations.
Kamilla says that the infected at the sports conventions are virtually excluded.
“ If there is no further isolation from these individuals after spending time with them at these sports conventions, we can maintain that we are protected from the conventions.
But it hasn't been revealed," said Kamilla.
The P.R. work is under constant review.
“ We need to be ready to interrupt with further advice or restrictions if it seems warranted, ” said Kamilla.
After more than a week, there is room for mass limitation to reach a thousand people.
This new situation could affect compromises.
“ The Decision of Meditation to Cook ” - See the Food of Elisa Woods
Elisha Viðarsdóttir is an outstanding soccer woman who plays with Val.
She is also a master of nutrition education, a mother, and works as a food expert.
She needs a lot of energy for today’s routine, and she usually takes time to cook good, nutritious food.
My usual day starts by coming to work from eight," says Elisha.
“ After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl at the nursery about three o’clock. ”
Elisa feels very close to picking up her daughter early in the nursery.
“ It’s good to have some time with her before I go to rehearsal in the afternoon.
After practice, it's good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one aspect of her mind emptying her mind."
Elisha does not follow a certain diet.
She is finishing her career as a teacher in nutrition science, so she well knows what is right for her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family, and exercise.
“ What suits me is eating a variety of foods that are well made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
However, I find it most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to place food into bad or good, rather nourishing or dieting.
You see, it's okay to eat everything, just not all of a sudden, and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I feel that there is a measure of meditation in standing in the kitchen to cook and getting it very much.
I have to say that my confidence is in the kitchen, and I really believe that I'm a good cook."
Breakfast: Haves, the seed of Chia, the seed of Hampta, salt, a little lemon juice, lay in the milk of almonds all night.
Toss this meal with whatever happens.
Most of the time, it is banana and mouse & KAFFI.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Transition: Amazingly different, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, clean skims with bananas and music, bread with an instrument, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box, if that is the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of foodful salads out of the refrigerator, cocaine, or barley, falafelbolls, rock salad, woven vegetables with good dressing is a bit of what I am working with.
If the organization goes completely out of control (which often occurs), the egg machine at work has come to my rescue a lot, and then it's two loaves of bread with butter, cheese, and boiled eggs, and don't put any more on you.
Intensification: Get me something carbohydrate for exercise, bread with a pair of creams, cereals, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish are very often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Police and Protestant Conflicts in Seattle
The state of Seattle, Washington, has declared a state of revolt following a large protest in the center of the city.
Last night, police resorted to a flash bomb and pepper spray to try to clear up a large area conquered by Protestants and extended over many blocks of houses near the city councilhouse.
Police announced that at least 11 Protestants had been arrested and that there was a test of vandalism at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some sort of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that Protestants stoned police with rocks, bottles, blast bombs, and other loose ones and were taken to a hospital where his injuries were injured.
The protests in Seattle, however, were peaceful for the long time off.
They had been heard to show resistance to Protestants in Portland, Oregon, where there has been a repeated conflict between Protestants and the heavy armed forces of the FBI.
As in other cities in the United States, people gather under the signs of Black Lives Matter remember George Floyds, who was killed by a policeman in Minneapolis, May 25, protests systematic racism in the American community and demands improvement.
Do not cancel until after a vote
There is still no evidence to determine whether the origins of the stewardess Icelandir who will be canceled by the next month.
It's a French vote on the Icelandic Air Lady's Wings Association on behalf of a stewardess at Icelandir's end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlint Liney Jonsdóttir, director of the Society, says that Icelandair will not decide about the information until the decision is made.
“ It really hangs together, ” says Guðlin Lón.
“ There have been no retraction, this must be started so that the machines can be humanized.
Of course, people are anxious to know if they will have any work after the month."
It's about a contract signed a week ago, on the night of July 19th.
It is expected that it will mark to the end of September 2025 and that it is based on a contract previously drafted by stewardesses.
On July 17, the Management Board and the Consumer Council of Iceland’s Veterans Association agreed to declare a full-time employment stop at Icelanda, which members agreed on for a vote.
It never came to her, but it was decided that this was followed by Icelandi's decision to drop out of the airline, quit all their stewardesses, and seek contracts with another trade union.
Then the pilots of the organization were to take on temporary duties by microgrimors.
Ask her how she feels that the vote will go away, says Godlaus Liney is hard to determine.
“ People are injured after this Icelanda mission, when all the stewardesses of the Society were laid off and announced that another trade union would be negotiated.
It's time to see if it's any good," she says.
At the end of April, there were 940 stewardessses serving at Icelanda, 900 of them, about 95%, reported.
Their notice deadlines vary, with those who last their careers, are three months, so they end the month of July.
This includes about 90% of the islands of Iceland.
What will be the price of the contract not approved?
“ Then we wish to continue our conversations with those we meet.
With this deal, we're meeting Iceland's demands.
If rejected, it is clear that the stewardesses have gone too far."
The vote for a labour agreement is over and Icelandair presents the development of the second quarter tomorrow.
The stewardess' vote for a new agreement ends at 12 o'clock tomorrow.
Icelandair's production for another quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary data indicate that the income of the Society was reduced by 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electronic vote on Iceland's Veterans Association and the Consumer Association for Icelands began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 p.m.
Those who can vote on the deal are Icelanders who pay dues to the Flying League.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new agreement on Sunday evening, July 19, but Friday had the Icelands broken up with the Society after a flight crew broke off the previous vote at the beginning of July.
By then, Icelandir had told all the stewardess and airline pilots up Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new agreement was signed.
According to a new agreement, stewardesses have to fly five hours more each month for the same basic wage.
The 2025 Children’s Convention has been integrated with the rules of pilots and stewardess for how long to fly on one watch.
The contract was presented to members of the FIBI, at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and described many stewards as a news agency, who spoke to them about dissatisfaction over the contract.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement had to be accepted to keep FIA alive.
Icelandair's report for the second quarter will be presented tomorrow, while the EUBIT Society, its budget for funding and taxes, is negative by the provisional data of 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars, or some 15 billion dollars.
Incelandair sent provisional calculations last Wednesday, which said that the Society’s income was about $60 million in the quarter or $1.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, the amount and the equivalent of money were about 154 million dollars.
Icelandair also aims to publish the company’s share money in August.
Icelandair aims to complete contracts with 15 creditors, the government and Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of a month before going to a stock market.
New variants rather than new viral types
“ New virus just means it's been someone who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been happening around here, says Maur Kristjánsson, head of the National Hospital for Disease Control, reports that a “new type of virus ” has been identified in this country.
Three domestic transmissions were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the social activities of a sports club at Rey Cup, but the source of the infection is unrecognizable and infectious.
A person who came to the country on July 15 was also diagnosed as having contact with him began to display the symptoms of VID’s COVID 19.
At that time, infections associated with infections reported last day and after a serial analysis of the Icelandic genetic analysis revealed “a new type of virus not previously identified."
Implantation is complete in connection with this infection.
This virus is not a new virus. It is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new crown virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more appropriate to talk about a new form of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asking what that means and whether it might indicate that another epidemic wave has begun, Már says that it is as if it were a single case, and it could go beyond that.
“ However, if there are cases within countries that do not have links from abroad with the same genotype as this particular variant, then the conclusion [of the second wave] could be drawn, but it is untimely at this time," explained May.
Oh, dear in the hot tub
Is the secret to the happiness of the Icelanders hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC daymakers lead to the like in a fun video that sheds light on the land’s swimming pools and hottie culture.
The Icelandic bather is worldwide, and it is claimed that there are as many people in the world who pray on every farm.
The natural earth’s lips are the foundation of it, but also the tradition for the swimming industry that exists here.
Children’sundance was legal in 1940, but older citizens are no less diligent in using the hot water for their health.
Travels are described as a solid part of the country’s general well - being.
In the hot tub, they're all equal regardless of class and status.
Free from cell phones, people discuss personal notes about home and space, or they enjoy the amassing power of water: Meditate and download the batteries of soul and body.
On the break, picking up a hundred days for elections
One hundred days is until the United States votes and chooses a president for four years.
Donald Trump wants re-election, but he's got to attend.
Joe Biden, the prospective Democratic Party, has a far superior advantage over Trump national polls.
According to a recent survey by AP News Station, the majority of Americans feel that the country is on the wrong track.
Similarly, Trump’s reaction to a global outbreak of the new crown virus is very unpopular, and more Americans than previously considered the president to have kept economic problems.
In fact, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
Thirty - two percent claim to support Trump’s reaction because of the epidemic, and 48 percent say he kept the economy well.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden is followed by 49.9 percent nationally, but followed by Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has been trying to shift his attention from his career to Biden, promoting so - called cultural debates, promoting policies that should be brought into law and order.
However, Biden’s campaign is eager to keep Trump focused, and it is highly likely that if the election is really about how Trump has done his job in the last four years, it will be a success.
Unfriendly Trump also seems to address members of the Republican Party, fearing that the Democrats could even reach the majority of the U.S. Senate, which has so far been very hoarse.
Politico told of the day’s survival of a pack and candidate comparable to that of the Republican Party for decades.
Extension has been particularly bad in the 2016 congressional elections, and now it seems that this trend will continue.
Trump has spent the last few days trying to scare the people of the suburbs into following him, including saying that he will become President Biden, destroying the suburbs of the United States, and promoting racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has dismissed regulations from Barack Obama’s time in the White House, which was designed to increase the variety of suburbs.
Then he urged the “mothered ” suburb of the United States to read an article by former U.S. assistant governor of New York, claiming that Biden would destroy the U.S. suburbs and take over Trump.
“ Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I'll keep it, and even better!" said the president.
The locals of the United States are a growing group of voters.
According to NPR, about half of all voters are in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mit Romney received the majority of the votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
The surveys have shown that despite the narrow majority of Trump’s continued efforts in the 2016 suburbs, its followers have been greatly attracted.
Although there are differences between the studies, Biden has suggested a 15 percent advantage over Trump in the abroads lately.

Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision to delay the Olympics, events that have only advanced world wars, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic fire would be “the light at the end of the tunnels, ” referring to a coming global epidemic of crown viruses that the inhabited earth is now going through together.
More than a year is spent preparing for preparation, and Japan’s authorities add to the cost because of their delay.
But everyone keeps their heads at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese delegates ’ celebration was genuine.
They wept and laughed at each other, for Tokyo had sought to keep the games in 2016, but it was at a lower rate for Rio, Brazil.
This time Tokyo, Japan, was to bathe in the world’s attention.
The games were to take place on July 24 to August 9, but they have been postponed for a year, replacing it on July 23, 2021, and they finish on August 8.
If they fail to keep the games, if the crown virus still poses too much threat, then the games will be canceled.
But no one wants to think that way to the end.
Olympics are no ordinary sports contests.
There is nothing to save, the show should always be awesome and seek to top the last game.
The choice of a city for the Olympics is based on a selection committee's assessment of the city's introductions.
The grander the presentation — the more likely it is to have the prize.
Tokyo spent $150 million in an effort to maintain the 2016 Olympic Games or $15 billion.
The second time, when applying for the game 2020, there were 75 million dollars, some ten billion dollars, in the presentation.
Thus, in 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo was given this year, Japanese authorities already spent $3 billion on the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean, considering how much it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums, and in general to strengthen the interior of the country to handle such conventions, prepare them, and maintain their own games.
Plants in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, who should have been engaged these days but have been delayed for one year by the crown virus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
Yet, a report from a public accountant in Japan, released at the end of last year, showed that the cost was nearly doubled.
Likely, the cost of delaying the games cannot be fully estimated, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two billion and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could, therefore, run between 15 billion and 30 billion dollars.
The figures are so high that all tax revenues in the United States would only cover about half the Olympic Games, on the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are an event of the magnitude that they have become subject to economists who try to look at numbers and see the benefits and profits of the games.
In the shortest case, there seem to be quite a lot of people who have concluded that the effects of the Olympic Games are less than positive for the economics of the cities that keep them.
Short - term effects are some, for example, a growing number of jobs, but in the long run, cities are often stuck with debts and high costs of low - use human resources.
In Brazil, Rio is stuck in debt because of the 2016 games and has been in trouble to support all the major athletes that were built for the games.
The figures have been added to the London 2012 games, which have shown that only 10 percent of those who received professional Olympics in the city were out of work before.
This means that there was only a small amount of new jobs.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in maintaining Olympics because of the dwindling costs of human activation built for the games.
The benefits, however, are generally considered to be in increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, though there is great uncertainty about the games 2021.
It is also uncertain whether the number of viewers who normally attend the games can be accepted.
The main issue, however, is the honor given to the cities, but it is difficult to evaluate for money.
In spite of the tremendous cost, the joys played by the players can also be said not to be placed on it.
Of course, while the show may be magnificent and there is no saving place, it's not just money.
It's the sports heroes that are in the background.
For some successful individuals, it is surprising that they are welcome to postpone the games.
For example, the Australian five-tasker and the gold-winning winner in her paper on the Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, is pregnant and would have been far from sporting in the summer but have lost hope of being in a race form for the games 2021.
So it is among the athletes who are just rather satisfied with the deferral, for understandable reasons.
For the athletes who planned to quit after the games this year, if they had been held on time, the timing of the games would somehow mean that they would quit before the games.
Simply do not trust your body to go through another year of strict exercise.
Few athletes were as thorough in the audience's hearts at the Olympics in Rio 2016 as the sports star Simone Biles.
She brought home four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles have recently attended several interviews in their country of America to discuss the Olympics.
She's going to play the game 2021, but she's not so sure she'll still be at the top of the games next year, so she'll be 24.
While it is generally not considered advanced, it is higher for a professional actress in the first order.
“ It’s a sensitive subject, ” says Biles, but smiles at another interview published at the Instagram Olympic Committee, asking if it will reach as far in the 2021 games as it did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I'll still be at the top after another year of rehearsals, ” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body is unable to cope with the pressures of professional training much longer.
Nevertheless, she works hard for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admits that there was an unpleasant feeling to have to stop practicing suddenly when the pandemic stood as the highest, and the stadium was closed.
There was no exception to Biles as long as all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold could buy no more access than the others; she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic structure certainly is slightly better than that of most people.
“ We have a rigid plan now.
It was hard to start again after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we're back on track, and I'm going to increase my practice more and more as the year goes on.
Of course, we do not know exactly what these games are going to be like or whether they will be held, but we still practice it, that's all we can do.
I've worked too hard to leave the sport now," says Biles.
It, like others, naps doubt, or perhaps more conscious that the situation may arise, not at all, 2021, but at the same time.
But to predict it is hopeless.
No one can know how the pandemic crown virus situation will be in July 2021, and nothing else can do but prepare for the Olympics as they are held in the year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid Pass.
Delayed a Epidemic Marriage
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorerette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
“ I think there are other more important things to think about right now, ” said the actress in a conversation with People.
“ We really want to get married sometime, and we want to have our dream wedding, and we have all the people we care about.
But we decided to postpone it and focus on what is important right now, and that is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I'm looking at world affairs more than weddings these days.
There's a lot going on and we should focus our attention on what's going on in the world."
