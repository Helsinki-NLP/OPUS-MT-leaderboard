Welsh stewards worry about 'looking like a fool'
Uggur is in some stewards for a proposal to have their title changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
The concerns have come as a result of a plan to change the name of the Council to the Welsh Parliament.
Councillors from all categories are concerned that this could make them ridicule.
One steward from the Labour Party said that his party was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers living outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means mad and pwp means excrement.
A councillor from the party Plaid Cymru said that the party as a whole was "unsatisfied" and made other proposals for the name.
A councillor from the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party had an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that there was not much difference between the word MWP and Muppet (flón).
In this context, it can be stated that the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to u in Icelandic.
The council, which is currently working on a bill to submit the name changes said, "The final decision on all names held by members of the Council will, of course, lie with the members themselves."
The Statute of the Government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council issued the results of a public opinion poll showing strong support for calling the Council the Welsh Parliament.
In terms of stewardship title, the Council selected WMP (Welsh Parliament members, Welsh Members of Parliament) but the MWP received the largest support from the public in the polls.
According to news reports, councillors now submit other proposals, but it may prove difficult to reach an agreement for the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, to submit a bill on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes in how the Council works, including rules for expulsion of stewards and the organization of the committee system.
Councillors will be able to pay a final vote on their title as debates on the bill begin.
Macedonians go to vote in elections for name change on the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "The Republic of North Macedonia."
This case was submitted to a vote in an attempt to resolve decades of disagreements with neighboring Greece, which has its own province with the name Macedonia.
The city of Athens has long argued that their neighbour's name in the north is equivalent to a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to their applications for membership in the EU and Nato.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said that he will not regard the election as valid.
However, supporters of the votes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid to gain membership in the EU and Nato.
St. Martin's Church bells sound as churches in Harlem have difficulties
"The elderly people I've spoken to said that in the past a bar and church could be found on every street corner," Mr Adams said.
‘Today neither can be found there.'
He said it was understandable that bars are declining.
‘People have other ways of meeting' nowadays, he said.
"Bars are no longer the centers of the neighborhood where people meet regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money generated from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect "and sooner or later they will be back in the starting slot."
He added that there were possible churches replaced by residences filled with people who will not help save the remaining refuges of the vicinity.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and will consequently accelerate the permanent closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black - Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin‘s Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation emigrated in the 1930s.
A congregation of blacks who had worked nearby took over the building.
A congregation of blacks took over the St. Martin‘s church under the guidance of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who took the initiative to bypass shopkeepers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who longed to hire black employees or grant them promotions.
The building was seriously damaged by a fire in 1939, but members of Father Johnson's congregation made plans to rebuild it and they also had the clock game built.
Rev. David Johnson, son and successor of Rev. Johnson proudly called the clockplay "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who played the clock game in July called it an alternative name: a "cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first clock game in the world on which a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played, but he moved to a larger clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not got anyone else in his place.
Over the past few months, numerous architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders and others by the diocese.
The Council of Churches - which oversees the parish and is appointed church leaders - wrote to the diocese in July and expressed its concern that the diocese "would seek to bring the costs over to" the Council of Churches, even if it had not contributed to the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parish members complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wounds 13-year-old boy who dived for lobster in California
According to authorities, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and wounded him Saturday when the boy was diving for a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. local time near Beacon‘s Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving along with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and then rowing over along with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he thought at first that it was only tension over having caught a lobster, but then “he realized that the boy cried out“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
All his collarbone was torn up," said Hammel about what he saw when he came to the boy.
"I shouted at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he lies seriously wounded.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
The Coast Guard commander, Larry Giles, said at a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious damage to the upper body.
Authorities blocked coastal access from the Ponto Beach coast in Casablad to Swami‘s coast in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and security purposes.
Giles said that over 135 different species of sharks were in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury‘s with a plan to haze a field in the United Kingdom's cosmetics market
Sainsbury‘s plans to pursue Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic shelves in a shopping centre style and with specially trained assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter the cosmetics market of the United Kingdom, which is worth £2.8 billion and is growing increasingly while sales of fashion and home goods are declining.The larger cosmetic shelves will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and will be set up in more stores next year if successful.
Investment in cosmetics is part of the way supermarkets used shelf space that used to be used by TVs, microwaves, and home products.
Sainsbury‘s says he plans to double his cosmetic selection to up to 3,000 brands, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L‘Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt‘s Bees will also receive increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The store also plans to resume sales of its Boutique cosmetics selection so that the majority of the products are road-friendly, but younger consumers demand it to an increasingly large extent.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop will test a product stand in two Sainsbury‘s stores, the first one opened in Croydon, south London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the increased tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food daily in neighborhood stores means that supermarkets need to work harder to get people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury‘s, said that the stores would resemble shopping centers to an increasingly high degree as the chain of stores tries to fight the low-income Aldi and Lidl stores with more service and other goods than food.
Sainsbury‘s has placed Argos camps in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat camps since both chains were purchased two years ago.They say it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The store's previous attempt to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical units was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury‘s tested partnership with Boots around the year 2000, but this ended due to disagreements over how to share the revenue from the sale of drugs in the supermarkets.
The new policy comes as a result of Sainsbury‘s selling its pharmaceutical stores, which numbered 281, to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Drug Stores, at £125 million three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will have a role in these plans by adding a large selection of luxury skin brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury‘s marketing director, said: "We have revolutionized the look of our cosmetic shelves to improve the environment for the customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be on hand for advice.
Our trademark selections are designed to meet all needs; charismatic environments and comfortable locations make us an exciting cosmetic store that transforms old trading habits."
Peter Jones 'exasperated' after Holly Willoughby cancels an £11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star from Dragons Den's show, became "excited" after television host Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11 million deal with his company to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home goods and accessories brand, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, a trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, a 37-year-old presenter on This Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star from Dragons' Den, with the painful forehead by retiring from participating in a late-minute popular lifestyle company to focus on new and lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "extremely angry" at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the television lady popularly admitted she did not have enough time for the home goods and accessories brand Truly due to the new contracts worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been compared to Goop, the brand name of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was intended to double Willoughby's assets, whose estimated value is £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram her intention to withdraw from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to stay at one of her many summer homes.
One source reported: “Truly was on Holly’s list of priorities.
This was to be her future project that would earn her income for the next two decades.
Her decision to quit surprised everyone completely.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short in that the line went to market.
There is a full layer of goods in Marlow's headquarters that are ready to go on sale."
Experts believe that the elimination of This Morning introduction, which is among the UK's most popular stars, can cost the company millions due to heavy product investments, ranging from pads and candles to clothing and household products, and potentially causing further delays in the product line going on sale.
This could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as Chairman of the Board in March.
Pairs spend their summer vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's company, which produces television content.
Willoughby will become the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the director of ITV's show I'm a Celebrity.
A close Jones source said last night, "We don't want to say anything about his business affairs."
Hard discussions "and then we fell in love"
He joked with the criticism he received from the press, for saying something many people would consider inappropriate for president, and for being so positive about North Korean leaders.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Said Trump and imitated the voice of a reporter.
‘I haven't given up anything'.
He stated that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, talks to shut down nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's chief ambassador, said to international leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the north had not received a "appropriate response" from the United States at North Korea's first steps towards nuclear disarmament.
He said that instead, the United States continued up business bans for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was all the more positive in his conference speech.
"We get along big time with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of individuals would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim had yielded positive results - missile tests had ceased, hostages had been released, and the earthly remains of American soldiers were returned home.
He also defended his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake are causing severe damage to an island, hundreds have perished
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, an international aid organization was told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of Lombok's population had to flee their homes, a state of emergency was not declared, a prerequisite for international organizations to begin aid activities there.
"In many cases, they have unfortunately made clear that they are not going to ask for help from international organizations, so this is difficult," Ms Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain when foreign aid workers can start work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian councillors were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations should be allowed to assist in the relief effort.
Given the prevalence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is tragically ill-prepared to protect against the forces of nature.
Flood wave defences have been erected in Aceh, a rare sight on other coastal lines.
It seems that the lack of tsunami warning whistles in Palu increased casualties even if a warning has been issued.
Even in the best of circumstances, traveling between the many islands in Indonesia can be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A medical ship that has lain at a port in Lombok to nurture victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made it the main point of his campaign to reform Indonesia's dilapidated transport routes and he has contributed a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's government, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to contend with ongoing tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religious orientation.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as the gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Look: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equalizes against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri for 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team was under 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then attempted a shot to a goal towards the far post.
The ball flew high over the goal and towards its right corner.
The ball eventually crossed Kepa Arrizabalaga, which jumped up, and into the net.
"I just wanted to try to get into this position, to catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as long as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante come and touch once and didn't think so much about it, but just took the shot.'
Chelsea were over 1-0 at half time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the inning, the Chelsea offensive player gave the ball with a heel kick to Mateo Kovacic and then sprinted from the centre to Liverpool's half of the game.
Kovacic made the ball pass quickly between the center.
Then he sent the ball impressively ahead and sent Hazard in for a penalty.
Hazard ran off the defenders and scored in the far corner with a left foot shot passing Alisson Becker, Liverpool's goalie.
Liverpool play against Naples in the semifinals of the Premier League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the UEFA European League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Number of deaths rises to 832 after tsunami in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to an announcement by the national disaster agency early Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency, said at a press conference that a number of people had been buried when buildings collapsed during the earthquake that occurred on Friday, with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter Scale. The quake caused tsunamis that reached heights of up to 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man, suspected of murder, after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to turn themselves in if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask all those in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have caught something in the picture with their car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
Today afternoon, people who believed they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are working to inform the victim's closest aides.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him that no one could enter the building or leave it.
He was mute when he discovered what had happened.
Residents have now been told that many hours could pass until they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard saying to a man that the whole area was now believed to be the scene of a crime.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She constantly repeats, "This is so terrible".
At 14:00, two police cars were located within the marked area of the police force and one car just outside.
A number of policemen stood within the marked area and watched the apartment buildings.
Anyone who could have any information is asked to send a direct message on @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact anonymously at the Crime Line by phone 0800 555 111, and give the number 247 as of September 30.
The British Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the latest monument accused of "recording history"
The statue's ban would be poetical justice for the Taliban destruction of his fanatical Puritan escorts on so many of England's cultural and religious jewels.
However, the Cromwell Society said that Mr. Crick's proposal was "few" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate over having statues removed, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be struck.
The opposition of the English Civil War to cultural symbols was neither an order nor an act of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the preceding century.
The fine statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is indicative of the frequent spirit in the 19th century and is part of the history of a man many believe to still deserve praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps rather in the late 19th century than today, to have been the patron of parliament against external pressure, in his case, the monarchy.
There is still much historical disagreement whether this description is entirely correct.
However, it is certain that the conflict that existed in the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known individual who represents one side of that conflict.
It is worth saluting and commemorating his achievements as a protector of the state."
Pig attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China, according to local reports.
The man, who is referred to solely by his last name "Yuan", was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered with blood near a stylist in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to reports from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into a pig in a pig-sitter on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his uncle from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, the uncle found him dead and saw that a door into a nearby pig's ten stood open.
He said that inside the stylist, there had been a large hog with a bloody mouth.
A court investigation confirmed that the 250 kg hog had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My uncle's feet were bloody and wounded," said the uncle, with the last name 'Wu', to the Guiyang Evening News news agency.
A recording from a security camera showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it did not attack anyone else while police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to the news, Yuan's family and the owners of the market are in talks about compensation before his death.
There are documented cases of pigs attacking people, although it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, seriously wounding the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig pinned a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood taste can provoke aggression in them.
“ They're just playing.
They're curious, they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to show them due respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa carry heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States
As predicted, the intensity of Hurricane Rosa is declining as it crosses cooler seas along the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry heavy rainfall, which could cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa became a Category 1 hurricane with a wind intensity of 136 km per hour, at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was located over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is estimated that Rosa will head north on Sunday.
At the same time, the formation of the Pacific Ocean is downhill, and it will head east towards the west coast of the United States, when Rosa arrives at the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will therefore follow a severe tropical cyclone to the north into the southwestern United States.
A rose will follow up to 25 cm of precipitation in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical debris will mix with the approaching depression, producing heavy and extensive rainfall over the southwest in the next few days.
Local 2.5 to 10 cm rainfall can cause dangerous flash floods, soil movement, and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical debris will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of rainfall per hour in some locations, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected at some locations in the southwest, especially in most of the state of Arizona.
There is a possibility of flash floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread of tropical rains.
People are strongly advised against going into the desert on foot when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn gulls into belding rivers, and thunderstorms result in sharp weather and dust storms.
The approaching depression will carry local rainfall in certain areas along the Southern California coastline.
There is a potential for over 1 cm of rainfall, which could cause slight soil movement and road noise.
This is the area's first rainy season rainfall.
Several scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rainfall spreads across a larger area late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across four states on Tuesday and will last out Wednesday.
Great temperature changes can be expected in October throughout the United States as the Arctic goes cold, but the tropical cyclone remains somewhat warm.
Sometimes this can cause high temperature fluctuations over short distances.
A very good example of a high temperature difference could be seen in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a nearly 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer warms will attempt to build up and re-release.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to get a warm start in October with temperatures around 25 degrees or more from the southern plains as far as the northeastern states.
Temperatures could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is approximately 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests that there is a high probability of temperatures above average for the eastern United States in the first half of the month of October.
Over 20 million people watched hearings over Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday, and testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that was supposed to have occurred in the 1890s.The testimony was broadcast on six different channels.
At the same time, the politic pattstand continued, and television stations interrupted the regular schedule to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, filed a bill to allow the FBI to investigate the allegations for one week.
Ford said to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to strip her at a school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was confident that it had not happened.
It is likely that more people watched the trial than the $20.4 million Nielsen reported to have been watching on Friday.
The company measured average ratings on the television channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other television channels showing the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems measuring people's ratings in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size to that for a football final or the Oscars ceremony.
According to Nielsen, most of the hearings, which took all day, watched the Fox News Channel or $5.69 million, the opinion given by that channel has faithfully supported Kavanaugh's nomination.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the trial.
Flake was the centerpiece of the hilt game on Friday.
After the office of this Republican Party member of Congress issued an announcement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, the cameramen of CNN and CBS captured pictures of when protesters made adjudication to him on Friday morning, as he tried to enter an elevator to get to a meeting with the Justice Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while ashamed rained over him live at CNN.
One woman said; 'I stand here right in front of you.'
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the people?"
People said to him, 'You have power while so many women stand powerless.'
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said he would comment further at a meeting of the committee.
The cable and television stations all had a live broadcast later when the Justice Committee voted on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be forwarded to elections by the Senate.
Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, while a minority of Democrats have urged it.
Flake became convinced in part after conversations with his friend, Chris Coons, a Democratic senator.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
Flake's vote was crucial because it was clear that Republicans did not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has given permission for the FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of "being in a political game" because of Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to walk out of the European Union of "being in a political game" about Britain's future and undermining the country's interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published next to her interview on the front page of the paper, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, granted that the so-called Chequers programme on Brexit, saying that the suggestion that Britain and the European Union should charge each other's customs was "absolutely outraged".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested one suspect over the death of Wayde Sims in a fatal shooting, who was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police.
Authorities released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, saying Sims lost his glasses during the brawl.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found genetic material from Simpson on them, according to WAFB, CBS's sister.
Police say Simpson confessed during interrogation to shooting Wayde and killed him.
According to his attorney, a certain amount of insurance was $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge County forensic pathologist's office released a preliminary report Friday that says the cause of death is a gunshot to the head and to the throat.
Authorities wanted to thank the Louisiana Police Special Forces, the police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department, and citizens in the area for the assistance of the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, chairman of sports at LSU, thanked law enforcement officials for their "appreciation and search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two-yard forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and took 2.6 hits for every game in the last season.
Will Wade, LSU's basketball coach, said Friday morning that the team was "hard hit" and "in shock" due to Wayde's death.
"This is something you worry about all the time," Wade said.
A volcano vomits ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention (U.S. National Center for Disaster Prevention) advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center observed vibrations and tremors from the volcano.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash on car windows in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 on Richter struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists just before the anniversary of independence vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters took on riot police and thousands took part in protests on the occasion of the first anniversary of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned riot police with eggs and threw powder paint that formed dark dust clouds on the streets, which would usually be otherwise filled with tourists.
Conflict also broke out later in the day, and police used batons to contain brawls.
Groups of separatists shouted, "We don't forget and don't forgive" for a few hours while their opponents shouted back, 'Long live Spain.'
Fourteen people needed attention for minor injuries they suffered during the protests, according to local media.
There is much tension continuing in the independent area one year after the October 1 referendum was judged illegal by the authorities in Madrid, but was welcomed by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but participation was poor as most of those opposed to segregation ignored the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to stop the elections at campaign sites across the area, which resulted in clashes.
Groups of independents had stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent protests in support of the country's police.
The protest march took place but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, participated in the separatist protests with his wife, saying that he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ Last year, we had some of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out for joy at being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving the necessary but scarce victory in regional elections last December, Catalonia's independent parties have struggled to hold a damp this year, with many of their most prominent leaders being either voluntarily exiled or in detention pending trial due to their role in the planning of the vote and the Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that politicians of both factions had encouraged the disagreement.
"The tension is growing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"My representation in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backlash in the field of democratic values and the repression we have seen the Spanish government use," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven onto a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, have been arrested after repeatedly driving to a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19.30 a.m. British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building themselves had been damaged.
It is also possible that a crossbow was fired towards the automobile.
Menga scores in Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's win
Livingston's team, coming from the lower division, caught the Rangers off guard, and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the difference and Gary Holt's team is now second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not yet won on the outfield in the qualifiers this season and plays against Hearts, who are eight points ahead in the top spot, the following Sunday.
Prior to that game, the Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the European League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the league with six wins, and lead coach Holt has not yet had to experience a loss since his replacement Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunity Against Bitterless Visitors
Holt's team should have been over long before scoring a goal, but their direct drive caused a lot of trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot past after routing through the defense to receive a bald pass from Graig Halkett across the goal.
The hosts had the Rangers play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause trouble to the visitors in the right places.
And that was how the crucial goal was scored.
Rangers got an extra kick, and Livingston worked on creating goal opportunities. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga combined, who took a pass and scored from midfield.
At that point the Rangers had dominated the ball but the defence of the homers was unbreakable and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper didn't have to make much effort.
Thus this continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the feet of Allan McGregor, a Rangers goalkeeper, and Lithgow shot from goal after innings from Livingston.
Spurs continually hit Livingston's penalty spot but were kicked off, and two demands of a penalty shootout - after Halkett's defense against substitute Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were dismissed.
Livingston's 'Beautiful' Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni stadium
An impressive performance and final for Livingston.
For an ordinary man, they performed fantastically and continued to exceed all expectations on their rise.
Their playing style and team members have hardly changed anything since they returned to the top division, but Holt deserves much commendation for having polished the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, captain was extremely good and led a fully organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes all the time.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard's control, they played far below expectations.
They did poorly to complete their innings and only once managed to open a field half of the locals so this should be a wake for Rangers who are now sitting in the middle of the league.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
There was a smile and a bright sky on Saturday (29 September), when leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which has the purpose of improving the relationship between the two Nato nations.
There have been disagreements between them over issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new, huge mosque.
The city is home to most of the Turkish population outside Turkey itself.
Police used security reasons to block 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters showed up in its vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also voiced and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
The two Protestant groups reflect how controversial this guest is, but he is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Conflict in Deptford: A biker was killed in a collision with a car
A biker was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast part of the city, at around 10:15 a.m. British local time.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics provided attention, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The collision occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision in which a driver drove off on Childers Street, 1.5 km from Saturday's crash site.
Police said she was working on identifying the man and informing his closest occupants.
The road has been closed and bus rides have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards wounded in riots
Six prison guards were injured when riots broke out in a men's security prison, according to an announcement by a prison agency.
A riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m. British local time on Sunday and still rages.
"Tornado" Special Forces have been called to the area in an attempt to foil the riots, which eight inmates are involved in, and are exclusively in one wing of the prison.
The guards received acquittal for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons said: “Specially trained detainees have been called out to treat cases that are ongoing in Long Lartin Prison.
Six employees have received accreditation due to injuries.
No violence has passed in our prisons and we make it clear that the responsible men will be handed over to the police and might expect to spend even more time behind bars."
Over 500 inmates sit in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden had had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And last October, riot police were called to the site to deal with a serious disturbance of peace, in which personnel with billiard bullets were attacked.
Hurricane Rose Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (dry areas could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to pass over Arizona, but this is likely to occur early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest, with the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for flash floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rosa will cross Phoenix straight on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with rainfall.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said on Twitter that only “ten hurricanes have been able to maintain strength to be classified as tropical storms or - downhills shorter than 200 miles (320 km) away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles (64 km) away from the Arizona border."
The last forecast from the National Hurricane Center predicts 5–10 cm of rainfall, with occasional rainfall up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to reach 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas of the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Lower Basin, with the potential for occasional precipitation of up to 10 cm.
For those who are not in danger of experiencing flash floods, the rainfall from Rosu could be a blessing because there is a severe drought in the area.
Although flooding can cause major damage, some of this rainfall will have a positive effect, as drought is now present in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought control, at least extremely dry in excess of 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest category," according to reports from weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rose was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind intensity of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and travels north at 19 km per hour.
The storm crosses cooler waters in the Pacific, so its power is declining.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or Monday night.
There is a potential for heavy rainfall in some areas of Mexico, with significant risk of flooding.
"A rainfall of 7.5 to 15 cm is being made in Baja California and into northwestern Sonora, with the potential for up to 25 cm of rainfall," said a report byweather.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then will continue up through Arizona, arriving in southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The highest risk expected to stem from Rosa or her remains is extremely heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and in the southwestern desert region of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and movement of soils in the deserts, and landslides in the mountain end.
The attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The youth skit was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04.00 a.m. British local time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be "stable".
One 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Police have asked witnesses who might have phone footage of what happened to turn themselves in.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "getted to feel evil and anger" from the Democratic Party
"A vote in support of Justice Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia State.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "getted to feel the evil and anger" from the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly denying allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified before the committee about his allegations.
The president said Saturday that "Americans had seen Kavanaugh's genius and human quality and courage" the other day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most brilliant attorneys of our time, an attorney with an impressive CV as a public servant," he said to a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters participating in the midterm elections.
“ It is five weeks into one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't volunteer, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm going around the wide field to fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were working to "tap and block."
The first key vote on the floor of the Senate Committee on Kavanaugh's nomination is to be held no later than Friday, according to an assistant Republican leader in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died after an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and it is likely that the number of dead will rise
At least 384 were killed and many were washed away as huge waves struck the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when as many as six feet high waves struck the beach at sunset, washing a number of people to sea, and destroying everything that happened to them.
The tsunami was formed after an earthquake of 7.5 points on Richter.
"When the tsunami threat formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they died," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, at an information conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it drew cars, logs, houses, it hit everything that was on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at 800 miles per hour before hitting the coast.
Some climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the ceiling published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and ruined bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to ride across the coastal city on Saturday.
The order of the earthquakes was observed in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's founding on food and technology use, said in a statement that the energy released in the big quake on Friday had been approximately 200 times higher than from the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was "severe" and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under debris from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and property damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north from Palu in an area known as Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's recordings.
Communications "lie completely down and no information is received" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"Over 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This has already become a tragedy, but could get much worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was criticised by many on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had flooded Palu, although official representatives said that the waves had come within the time of the warning.
In a video published on social media, one could be heard shouting from the upper floor of a building to warn the people on the street below that a tsunami was approaching.
Just minutes later, the tsunami hits the beach carrying away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages that blocked communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to organize relief efforts.
The military has begun sending planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief activities and will remain closed until October.
Joko Widodo, president is planning to visit refugee centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800 after a tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala have reached the city of Palu safely, where they seek shelter in camping cities set up in the park outside their offices; a destruction confronted them along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"People said they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Relief groups have begun difficult relief efforts, but some have complained that foreign aid workers with high levels of expertise would be blocked from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign financing, supplies and personnel may begin to arrive only if the disaster area is declared a disaster zone.
It has not been done yet.
"This is still a local accident zone," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open for foreign aid, but no statement has yet come."
As the second night fell over Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and their families, who are still missing, held to hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracle legends that cast a glimmer of hope on the depressing headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, aid workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body at her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian glider team, had been coached by two gliders, who are now missing, for the Asian Games which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who closed inside the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Mandagi.
‘As a man with long experience in glider, I have my own emotional burden to bear,' he said.
Mr Gendon reported that the hours after news was received within the glider group that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he had sent WhatsApp a message desperately to the contestants staying in Palu and participating in the beach festival.
However, his message showed a purely gray mark, instead of blue.
"I think it means the message wasn't received," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 at ATM filling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from a Brink employee, who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM in the entertainment area and was about to fill more money on it, said Dennis McCarthy, a police officer, in the announcement.
As he was doing his job, another man came "running behind the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the announcement, but police did not disclose how many people were involved in the case.
Those who could have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police by telephone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is going to change his name - in Ye.
He announced the change to Twitter on Saturday, writing, "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time, using the name as the title on his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his participation in the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi in the show, but she cancelled for "emotional reasons", said the producer of the show.
West has previously said that this name has religious meaning for him, but it is also short of his current name.
"I believe that 'ye' (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,' West said earlier this year when discussing the name of his album with radio talk show host Big Boy.
“ So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the one, and to just Ye—to be just a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West associate, has also written his name both with and without banding and high-pitched letters.
The elected President of Mexico vows not to use the military against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected President of Mexico, has vowed never to use military force against the general citizens, now that country will soon commemorate the 50th anniversary of bloody vengeance against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised to "never use the army ever to oppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers fired at a peaceful protest march in the square on October 2, 1968, and drowned as many as 300 people in a time when left-wing movements of students were shooting roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to assist young people in Mexico by giving all students a monthly scholarship and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of learning opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the funding it spends researching in that field, says the inventor and artificial intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after different departments of the U.S. government issued announcements of artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no formal overall plan for artificial intelligence.
However, China announced its plan last year: it aims to be in first place in innovation with artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the funding, which goes into artificial intelligence research, considering that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major discovery in artificial intelligence will be made in the United States, Lee said to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the major artificial intelligence companies in China.
He worked on an artificial intelligence system in the 1990s at Carnegie Mellon University, winning the best player in the United States in Othello, and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department at Google.
Lee spoke of previous technical contests, held by U.S. authorities, such as the defense department's robotics competition, and asked when the next race would be held, to spot the next innovators.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get grants from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that snatches the main thinkers, but the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have recruited geniuses from universities to work in artificial intelligence over the past few years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its artificial intelligence research.
"I feel that those with a PhD in artificial intelligence should receive a residency automatically," he said.
The Parliament of China released its Future Artificial Intelligence Program in July 2017.
The China Institute of Natural Sciences provides funds for people working at university institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense set up an artificial intelligence center, which is intended to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AINext.
In terms of NSF, it invests over $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation, which was designed to create a safety body for artificial intelligence, has not progressed for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to "The Republic of North Macedonia" in an attempt to resolve decades of disagreements with Greece, which has shut down their application for membership in the European Union and Nato.
Greece has a region named Macedonia, claiming that their neighbour's name in the north is equivalent to a claim on their territory, and therefore denied them entry into Nato and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will undermine the identity of the majority of Macedonian population of Slavic origin.
Gjorge Ivanov, the president has said that he will not participate in the vote, and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts about participation reaching the 50 percent minimum required so that the vote is considered valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: "Do you want to walk Nato and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is a fair fee for Macedonia to gain membership in alliances such as the EU and Nato, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the country's future for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result is not legally binding, enough members of Congress have said that they will comply with it and tie it into law.
The name change would require approval by two-thirds of the council.
The Electoral Commission said that nothing unusual had been reported at 1:00 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent participation in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum on whether to change the country's name, but this would pay its way into Nato and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Congress of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, worked to prepare a small field and set up chairs in front of tents that had been built by those who will ignore the vote.
"We are in favour of Nato and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not go through the service door" said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn another way like China or Russia and become part of an Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says that accession to Nató will bring the necessary funding to Macedonia, with the percentage of unemployed being over 20 percent.
"I believe that by far the largest majority will accept that over 80 percent of the country's population is in favour of the EU and Nató," said Zaev after voting.
He said that approval would be a "confirmation of our future."
A poll published on Monday from the Macedonian Policy Research Agency showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, but this is lower than the required minimum.
Another poll from Telma TV channel, showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would say yes.
So that the referendum is considered valid, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not accepted, it could mean the first serious blow to the government's policy, which is in favor of the West, since it took over in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero, a Manchester City player, goes through all of Brighton's defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling went lightly with Brighton's defence in a Manchester City 2-0 victory Saturday at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the inning.
He sprinted past three Brighton defenders and then went out to the open field.
Aguero then became surrounded by four green-clad defenders.
He got past one defender and then ran away a few more just at Brighton's penalty spot.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English forward used the first touch within the penalty area to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play Mathew Ryan, Brighton's goalkeeper, with a shot in the right side of the goal.
"Aguero has some leg problems," Pep Guardiola, City's CEO, said to reporters.
“ We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal of the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a pass far inside the field half of Brighton in that inning.
He sent an impressive long ball on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent on Sterling towards the far post.
City forward sent the ball into the net just before it slipped off.
City play against Hoffenheim in the Championship at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a bout against the Rockies
As the Nationals have been ruled out from playing in the playoffs, there was not much reason to force another start.
But the energetic Scherzer hopes to get to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to make the playoffs, but they have a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division.
The Rockies received at least a "wildcard" seat with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still seeks to capture their first league title.
“ Even if we play for free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver as well as the rest of the team are sure to play their best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete in such a situation?"
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the first pitcher in Sunday's game, but are believed to have Scherzer pitch in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who would be starting a game for the 34th time, took a practice session on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday, which is his usual Sabbath.
This right-handed pitcher at Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 windings in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the case around Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters participating in the midterm elections.
“ Everything is at stake in November.
It's five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones...I don't volunteer, but I do, that's why I go around the wide field to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this terrible, radical group of Democrats, you can see that happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, over whom they have to go to gain power and control, they just want power and control, we don't give it to them.
He said that Democrats are working on "teasing and blocking."
‘And it has been seen in the past four days,' he said, saying the Democrats were ‘rageous and bad and cruel and untrue.'
He named Senator Dianne Feinstein, the dominant Democrat in the Senate's ruling committee, to a name, and was answered by a loud bout from the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked the document?
Ha, what.
No, look, I waited for one...it was really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a tolerant church.
He Can’t Hate Those Who Express Their Minds
When the activists of Momentum in my party chose to rebuke me, it hardly came as a surprise.
After all, I am the last of many members of the Labour Party who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our minds.
Joan ryan, my fellow senator received similar treatment because she strongly objected to prejudice against Jews.
In my case, the suggestion to give me acquittal was due to me disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues, and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders about.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that "we want the meetings to understand no ones left out and to be effective."
In my eight-year career as a Labour Party member, the Friday meetings have by far been exactly that.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of ‘more and better' politics has been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly apparent that different opinions have not passed in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged depending on whether the leaders of the party consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I previously thought had similar political views to myself began to expect me to take a complete reversal and support views that I had previously never agreed with, whether it was about national security or a common EU market area.
Whenever I speak publicly—and then little matters what I say—follows the crawling abomination on social media calling for my expulsion, central politics denied and told that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not solely my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, as most of the comments I get to me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and steadfastness of those who have to endure the husk of sexual or prejudiced insults daily but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing factors in this political period is how attacks and insults have become a natural part of everydayness.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should nurture a tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a tolerant church, and with every distrustful or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes increasingly narrow.
I've had a lot of advice over the last couple of years to keep a low profile, don't be too loud, and then I'd be 'okay' with me.
But I did not decide to enter politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of Thatcher's government that left my classroom in disrepair, I have campaigned for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in local government or in parliament.
I have never hidden my political views, neither at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can have any doubt about my policy views and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only like to say that when the country is heading in Brexit, which will damage homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But my only message, which I wish to send from me, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my district, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I proudly serve you and I promise that no threats of deviation or political expulsion will deter me from doing what I believe to be for the best benefit of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchdowns may have skewed the final result something, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory understood in this acutely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership league.
They are currently in the top spot on the list and the only team out of ten to remain undefeated.
Finally, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made the locals more victorious, and coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be happy.
"We've had tough opposition in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserves praise, they made better use of their opportunities than we do,"
Mark Grant Anderson brought Ayr over in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned the scoring around, but a yellow card on the Scottish captain, who was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot managed to score a touchdown.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a hell before scoring with a kick just before halftime and then a touchdown, bringing Ayr over 17-5 at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half strongly and Patrick Anderson's touchdown pass, after Baggot turned the offensive around, reduced the goal difference to five points.
Then, a long break of play had to be made to nurture a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott, who had to carry off a field of play, after which Ayr still increased his lead with a touchdown pass from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the offensive around.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, then got the yellow card, and Melrose once again took advantage of being a man over with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard offensive.
However, the locals came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for having tackled Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the Ayr offense, after an extra kick.
Climo turned the scoring around, as he did again immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe caught David Amrstrong's kick from a penalty and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the team's fifth touchdown.
Star of the Still Game show ready for a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game show, seems ready to move into restaurant business after it was discovered that he was appointed CEO of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC show popular, which he writes and plays in along with his old partner from the entertainment business, Creg Hemphill.
The double has announced that a future ninth series will be the last, and it appears that Kiernan has plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to say anything about the story, but a source from Scottish Sun hypothesized that Kiernan wanted to become a participant in the "living restaurant business" of Glasgow City.
'The Sea Is Ours': Bolivia's coastless country hopes that a court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines guard the fleet headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flaunt blue flags.
Fleet stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazons are labeled with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it."
Widely throughout the other landed Bolivian erupts the memory of the coastline, which was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century, still in fresh memory – along with the desire to sail through the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1 after five years of long litigation.
"Bolivia has the power, the spirit of unity and the lack of blood, and of course waits for the ruling with a positive mind," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivian residents will observe the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice of The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia on their claim that Chile is obliged to give Bolivia access to a sea, after many decades of difficult conversation.
The ruling on Monday is also extremely important for Evo Morales, the country's president of Indian descent who will have a controversial campaign for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe it unlikely that the court would decide in favor of Bolivia, and that doing so would make little difference.
The Court, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to give land from Chile and has stated that the ruling will not affect the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the court's ruling comes just six months after listening to the final speeches indicates that the case "didn't have been complicated," said Paz Sárate, a Silenese expert in international law.
It is also possible that over the past four years, Bolivia's case was not to the advantage, but rather caused the country's repercussions.
"The current Bolivian government has stolen the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morale's militant speech has discouraged any goodwill from Chile, she thought.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talks sometime, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
The two countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will gain "a unique opportunity to open for a new relationship with Chile" and an opportunity to "blank an end to differences that reach 139 years back in time, to the benefit of both countries," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never yield to its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
‘The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past.'
North Korea says there will be nothing of nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri made his speech Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow up on the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His remarks now come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea.
Ri says that there are "dreams" to think that the continuing trade baths and protests by the United States against a declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington will not accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes clear action to take down his nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the President of the United States want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there is much doubt that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows present the latest line of big headwear that will come to fashion shops near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, you do not need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne displayed a variety of weird hats in oversizes for their SS19 line in the fashion scene that fascinated the jet team at Fashion Week in Paris.
A number of images of extremely unsuitable hats have been published on Instagram this summer, and these designers have had their innovative creations on display at fashion shows.
The main work by Valentino was a large light brown hat with wide bars resembling feathers and covering the heads of the models.
Of other oversized accessories, watermelons could be seen placed gemstones, shaman hats, and even pineapples, but these items are not designed to keep heat on the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, right on time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had concave lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One mask resembled a diving device with breathing tube and glasses, while another resembled melting ice in bread form.
If you want to toll in fashion, luck is with you.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon come on sale in fashion shops near you.
Big hats come short on the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with over 60cm large bars that has adorned heads ranging from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion logo behind the extremely impenetrable hat seen on all social media was the inspiration for another large companion item displayed on the fashion scene – a straw beachbag that was almost as large as the swimsuit-wearing model that carried it.
The orange straw case, with strawbars and a white handle made of leather, was the main item in the La Riviera SS10 clothing line of Jacquemus during the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, a stylist of the celebrities, said in an interview with FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beachbags appear in fashion shops by next summer—as the designer has caused such a big impact, it should be hard to ignore after-questions for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for world citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for their students' outstanding success, and this has continued during 2018 with new, impressive test results, which are still supported by individual and group success in sports, arts, music and other community practices.
These schools have up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Private Schools Council, SCIS) in charge of them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible services.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further advanced education, the careers they have chosen, and their status as a world citizen.
As a teaching sector that can compile and teach by specially designed curriculum, we see that new issues continue to be a popular curriculum in the schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native tongue, it touches his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The test results of this year show us that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest percentage of students achieving exams in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received an excellent grade of A.
The data collected from 74 schools within the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received an excellent grade of A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received a grade of A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an essential qualification that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At the moment, languages, as a select section, are placed in the same seat as science-related curriculum (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private school curriculum and elsewhere.
A 2014 poll conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that for the reasons employers gave that hiring was difficult, 17 percent was due to the lack of people with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future activities.
Now that more and more jobs require language skills, this ability is essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career people choose, they will have a real advantage in the future if they learn another language, but they are a skill that lasts a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will give a multi-lingual character an automatic advantage over the rivals.
According to a poll conducted by YouGov in over 4,000 adults British in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak a second language well enough to sustain dialogue, and French was the only language spoken by a two-letter percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for modern children to invest in language education immediately.
Multitasking, especially in emerging market countries, will provide children with better opportunities to find a significant job.
In Scotland, it varies between schools which language they teach.
A certain number of schools will focus on more classic new languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important to the UK when viewed until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child's interest lies, he or she will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools commit to offering a learning environment, which will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, language continues to be necessary for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be viewed as "international skills in communication."
Private schools will continue to offer selection, diversity and excellence for Scotland's youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is Chairman of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' coach, has announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided for how many minutes he will play.
"It will be longer than one minute and shorter than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers said on Twitter that James would likely play for a limited amount of time.
After practice earlier this week, James was questioned about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"In this period of my career, I don't have to play pre-season games to prepare for," he said.
Timings for Trump's election rally in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings, and the first is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia State.
He is one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his choice of a new Supreme Court judge has been suspended, Trump aims to build up support for the next midterm election, because Republicans are at risk of losing control over Congress when votes will be cast in November.
What time is Trump's election rally in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 19.00 am Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29th, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the trial of Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh, where tensions arose over allegations of sexual harassment.The Senate vote to confirm him as a judge was suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
However, the main goal of the meetings at Trump is to assist Republicans in recovering from better momentum, but theirs awaits a difficult November election.
Therefore, the message from Trump's campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, aim to "fill volunteers and supporters of enthusiasm as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and in Congress," according to the Reuters news agency.
"Government over Congress is so necessary for the President's campaign plan that he will travel to as many states as possible when a busy campaign period begins to begin," said an unnamed spokesperson from Trump's campaign at Reuters' news agency.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco stadium in Wheeling and supporters are expected to come from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and that the Pittsburgh press will report it," according to the West Virginia Metro News Agency.
The meeting Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, but he won with over 40 percent difference in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to assist Patrick Morrissey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia to the Senate, but he is down in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to the Reuters news agency.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows struggling willingness to keep hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one-sided laps, the four-way race, which was Saturday afternoon, could be exactly what was needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
A swing in success is a sporting concept that has been invented and which players certainly believe in, and never more than in competitions like this.
Where would they say that success now lies?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four points, so the success lies rather on our side now, I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he set out in the race of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, believe they have a little wind in the sails and they can be hopeful over many things, especially the form at Spieth and Justin Thomas that played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played great well as far apart as flat and leads by his example.
The cheers rose as the ring progressed, and he put down an important putt to past all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points below after two games.
His putt, which secured them the win in the game on the 15th hole, had a similar shout of joy, shouting of the kind telling a man that he believes the American team still has a hope of victory.
"You just have to dive deep and think about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to earn points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the incumbent story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but fascinating European couple has won four games out of four and cannot do anything wrong.
The 'Moliwood' were the only pair to receive a sewage in the afternoon on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid schooling on Saturday morning, the afternoon on Friday, and on the nine-hole field on Friday morning.
That game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audience clearly shows that they are the pair that have to be defeated on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal the European team's possible victory than Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun being set over the Le Golf National field.
The best option would be for both to do so simultaneously on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson performed lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the foursome in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
Scholls and two doubles on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and Swede down into a hole from which they never managed to scratch themselves.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The quadruples and quadruples are so exciting to watch because of the interactions between the couples, their advice, the advice they don't give, and how a game plan can change in one turn.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant advantage for the final day, but this four-game cycle also showed that the U.S. team has the fighting will that some had doubted it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with a 10-6 lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup competition
Europe will have a good lead for the Ryder Cup's final day after Saturday's four-ball and four-game, with an advantage of 10-6 against the United States.
Star double Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who had difficulties, and have received four points on the Le Golf National field.
The European team of Thomas Bjorns, who would like to regain the medal trophy, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed a great advantage over the United States team in the morning's four-ball game, winning 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the four games, winning two games but failing to win up the points difference.
Jim Furyks' team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood" after a fantastic weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After completely defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they showed great team integrity and won downhill Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius occasionally, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball games and four-games, including seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who was out of rest for the morning's four-ball game, came back to his partner, Henrik Stenson in the four-games and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in first and third place on the world's best golfers list.
However, Europe did not all go in favor of this mild and gusty day southwest of Paris.
A three-time winner in major golf competitions, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won with difficulty 2-1 against Jon Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in four-ball games and later came back and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the four-games after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has won up a four-point difference at the start of an individual competition, although Furyk's team only needed a draw to continue the trophy.
However, after two days of being second best, it seems that Sunday's counterattack will be overhauled.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament "impossible" without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the U.N. on Saturday that the continued trade berth only increased their distrust of the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the U.N.'s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "remarkable measures to show goodwill" in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear test site, and promising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"On the other hand, we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the safety of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first."
Although Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "staged" approach to nuclear disarmament in which North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed special in that he did not unilaterally deny nuclear disarmament outright as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the acting President of the United States and North Korean leaders, in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim vowed to work on the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump issued a promise to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a solution to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also passed calls to relax a strict trade ban against North Korea.
"The U.S. requires that 'nuclear disarmament takes place first' and increases the pressure by using a trade berth to achieve its own, and even protests the declaration to end the war," Ri said.
“ It is only the fantasies of people who know nothing about us to think that a commercial bath can bring us to our knees.
But the problem is that the continuing trade proposal adds to our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke of at the U.N. earlier this week.
The minister instead spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, South Korea's leader over the past five months, adding, "If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea's replacement for the United States, this podium would not be in the case of nuclear disarmament in the Korean Peninsula."
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from his speech last year when he said at the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to target rockets from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after "the diabolical president" Trump called Kim a "fireman" in a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened to "complete destruction" North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking a step towards disarmament, but said that much work was still left and that a trade bender had to remain valid until North Korea had destroyed all of its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame in terms of this, saying, "if this takes two years, three years, or five months—it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that, "The security council's trade proposals must remain valid until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and it has confirmed."
The Security Council was unanimous to increase the trade ban with North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to shut down funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, saying afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea denounced him for making "criminal demands."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to take down a missile field and nuclear power station if the United States took "equivalent action."
He said Kim had told himself that the "equivalent actions" he sought were guarantees of security promised by Trump in Singapore and actions towards normal relationships with Washington.
Harvard students take classes at sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has provided all students with more sleep in an attempt to resist the growing tendency of students to stay awake and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study found that students at the world's best universities often know little or nothing when it comes to the basics of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and the Women's Hospital, designed the course and believes it sees the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea of doing the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning ability.
‘At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I told this first now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said toTelegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help student skills and performance in sports and even contribute to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the school's health care, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were extremely sleepless during the week.
The course is hourly in length and includes various interactive tasks.
One section depicts a room in a dormitory, where students click on cup of coffee, curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen with lack of sleep, along with the importance of good routine before sleep.
In another section, participants are told how a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“ We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we feel they have a right to know this, just as one is entitled to know of the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that favors those who stay awake and learn all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-growing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
The guarantee of gaining sufficient sleep of good quality should be a "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight loss, because sleep deprivation increases the brain's call for food so that the body is constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old in chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, but he sat one of the professor's curates last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students at school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all faculty members to complete a similar course before starting their studies at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider tuning an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them, noting the harmful effects from blue light produced by electronic screens and LED lights, which can confuse the body's inner clock and lead to trouble falling into sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark of Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
The Rangers still had trouble in the outfield as Stevens Gerrard's dismembered team had to settle for a 1-0 loss to Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
Ibrox's team wanted to achieve their first win in the outfield after their win over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard's team only their second loss in his 18 games as manager.The team is now eight points behind Hearts, who are in the top spot in the Ladbrokes Premiership division.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time, and Rangers' team seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to equalise.
The Rangers now drop to sixth, but Livingston goes up to third and are only behind Hibernian in goal difference.
The Rangers could get into further trouble after lineman Calum Spence had to receive an acquittal due to a head injury after some object was thrown into him from the visitors' field half.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and made his debut in the Betfred Cup.
However, Holt stuck to the same Livi 11 setup that reached a level of Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how his well-trained team members rolled over the opposition.
The Rangers were perhaps more involved with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls it caught.
They should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game when a first pass from Menga put Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but he shot past.
A long extra kick from Keaghan Jacobs then ended at Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defensive partner shot past the far post.
The Rangers regained control of the game but appeared to live rather in hope than believe in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales truly felt that he should have received hell when a quarter had passed the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers only managed to take two shots to a goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, a former Ibrox goalkeeper, did not have to have much to do with defending baldness from Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although a chance from Livi in the 34th minute had come despite the other team having the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, though only because of their perseverance.
Rangers again failed to make anything of a long extra kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose to send on Menga who then scored easily.
Gerrard took action at half time, sending Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibaly, and the trade had an effect almost immediately as the rear guard brought Morelos in, but Kelly responded quickly and ran forward to close the shot.
Still, Livingston continued to narrate the visitors to play just the type of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett picked up each long pass after another.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the closing minutes, but McGregor did well to deny Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran to a goal from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the Rangers' replacement, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs collapsed, but Thomson dismissed it again.
Almanac: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a page from our almanaki 'Sunday Morning': 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today and AFFRAM...this is the day future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of studying and measuring radioactivity, and that invention eventually led to a device called Geiger measure.
The Geiger measure has gained a solid place in the scientific world since then but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: 'What the hell is this?'
Rogers: “This is a Geiger measure, used to locate radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on you, you can hear the effects from the atoms due to radioactivity in the rocks."
Evans: 'It sure breaks right now!'
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of the treatment
Treatment involves removing and converting immune cells from the patient in the laboratory.
Then they can "see" proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and are then injected back into the patient
Experimental vaccine has shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months, the vaccine teaches immune cells how to recognise dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells out of a patient and converting them to a laboratory so they can "see" a protein called HER2 that is found in many types of cancer, then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our lower positions indicate that the vaccine is extremely effective."
HER2 "lets various types of cancer stop growing," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Berzofsky, a professor, said.
A similar method by which immune cells are taken out of patients and the "identification" of attacking cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a long monologue in support of Trump, carrying a MAGA dercap after appearing on the SNL television program.
It Didn't End Well
Baulted at Kanye West in the studio on a Saturday Night Live show after a long-word speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, in which he carried a Make America Great dercap, he spoke for a long time against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"I've spoken so often to white people who say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
If I was concerned about racism, I would have long since emigrated from the United States," he said.
SNL began the show with a stick where Hollywood star Matt Damon joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
Although West's long-final was not broadcast, the recording of it was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not certain whether Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the recording.
Also, West had complained to viewers that he had received a bad reception backstage due to his hat choice.
“ I was bullied backstage.
They said to me, 'Don't go up on stage wearing that dercap.'
They bullied me!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to reports from the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the deep hole?" and said that he would put on his superhero robe "because that means you can't order me to do it. Do you want the world to make progress?
Test love."
His comments were met with a babble from the audience at least twice and SNL actors seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, and one presenter said to the paper, "There was a stone silence in the studio."
West had been invited to the show replacing singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage appearance as he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, the chairman of the conservative party TPUSA, but she said on Twitter, "To one of the bravest souls: TACK FOR THE SECTION OF THE MUSIC MOTHERS."
But talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply being "himself and it's just wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his 'art') who I feel is supporting and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion, and the musical legend Prince is not to be forgotten the vows, who changed his name to a symbol and later called himself the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder after knife attack at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is expected to attend a courtroom in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, the star from the Crown Games, criticizes poisoned masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow on the violent adventure show from HBO, the Crown Games.
However, the 31-year-old actor has criticized the standard image of the masculine hero, saying that such on-screen roles mean that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes "something has gone wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem that toxic masculinity is during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from the Crown Games, the 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had "strong views" on how to deal with this issue.
‘Personally, I feel at the moment - what has gone wrong with masculinity?'
‘What have we taught men in their growing up, about the problems we see now?'
Kit believes that television is responsible in part for an increase in toxic masculinity, due to an extremely masculine character on television.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel as if they must be made by a man?
I think that's one of the most important questions of the time—how do we change this?
Because it's obvious that something's gone wrong with young men."
He also admitted in the interview that he would not play in any other Crown Games episodes after the series' similarity the next summer, saying that he had received "a sufficient amount of battlefields and horses."
Beginning in November, Kit will play in a re-creation of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about having played in the Crown Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife in these episodes, so they pretty much gave me my future family and my life after that," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's mistress played by Kit in these Emmy Awards shows.
The pair married in June 2018, on the land of Lesliar's family in Scotland.
HIV/destruction: China announces a 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people who are infected with the HIV virus or have AIDS.
Health authorities say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported just in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections were transmitted by sex, which is a change from what used to be.
In the past, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to donations of contaminated blood.
On the other hand, the number of people infected with the HIV virus in this way has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
Sex-induced HIV is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but heavy discrimination against LGBT people reportedly still occurs.
Due to conservative values in the country, research has estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections are caused by insufficient birth control in these marriages.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised access for everyone to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican senators, criticizing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a congresswoman denied Saturday allegations that one of her employees had disclosed the personal information of three Republican Party senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said that these claims came from "overright" extremists and websites.
"Lies, lies and more miserable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published reportedly contained addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday from an unknown party on Capitol Hill during hearings at the Senate Committee on Brett Kavanaugh, a nominee of a Supreme Court judge, on charges of sexual harassment.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP numbers identifying the source of the information were linked to Waters' office and published information about one of its employees, according to Capitol Hill information.
"This unconvincing accusation is absolutely a false and pure lie," Waters continued.
"My employee—whose personal information and security are now at risk because of these false accusations—was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unconvincing accusation is absolutely a false and pure lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including that of Ara Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
‘This denial is full of anger,' Fleischer wrote.
“ This suggests that she does not have a mood to sit in Congress.
When someone is accused for no reason, do not respond with anger.
It is not to be shown opposition.
It is not to be questioned on the grounds of the person who accuses.
It must be shown calm and overwhelming."
Fleischer seemed to compare Water's response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics said had seemed too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate against Waters in the midterm election, also said his opinion on Twitter.
‘Big case if true,' he gleaned.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed "appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and that they will be brought to justice for all the acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Film review for Johnny English Strikes Discipline - spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson proves to be low-powered
It has become a habit now to look for Brexit references in all new films featuring Britain, and it seems to be relevant in this revival of the Johnny English comedy series - which started in 2003 with the film Johnny English and just woke back to life in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Will this canteen of satire about how clearly miserable we are to be a new export opportunity for the country?
Whether this is the case or not, the out-eyed, greasy and clumsy Johnny English has been given a renewed license for the second time to mess up everything - his name shows above all that he is a creation designed for an exhibition in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the wise intelligence officer who pretends to possess charismatic charm but is a slight mix of Clos, a dass of Mr. Bean and a little slab of the man who played one note for the song the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
He is also originally based on the tourist and mystery world citizen that Atkinsons once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving everything in chaos.
There is one or two fine scenes in this latest Johnny English film.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking to a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the helicopter blades shot in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his comedy skills, but the humor seems rather dynamic and strangely superficial, especially now 'serious' films such as James Bond and the Mission Impossible films also offer without hesitation.
The joke seems to be more intended for children than for adults, and I felt the adventures Johnny English had in a less imaginative and focused like Atkinson's silent comic strip in the guise of Mr. Beans.
The eternal premise of the film now is that Britain is in great trouble.
A computer hacker has managed to break into Britain's secret spy network and uncovered the identity of any British spy, much to the dismay of the spy who is on the watch - but there, unfortunately, Kevin Eldon appears in an overly small role.
This is the final straw for the Prime Minister who is an arrogant and controversial figure and already in great trouble due to massive political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with her role as a character to be reminiscent of Theresa May, but the script is not up to many fish for her.
Her advisors tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had retired.
And there comes Johnny English himself, now a school principal at some fine school, but also provides a secret lesson in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes as English offers a spy school reminiscent of the film School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where he meets Bough, his former long-lost partner, whom Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submariner, but in that energetic role Vicki Pepperdine does not quite manage to let his light shine.
The spy duo who messes everything up in Her Majesty's service is now back in gear and meets the high-altitude Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is impressed by the magic of the charming billionaire in the technology sector, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problem: it is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their refutation missions: they set fire to a fine French restaurant disguised as servants, they cause trouble as they smuggle themselves into a luxury yacht Volta, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to study the interior of Volta's house.
There is no saving in that finale, but although the film is vibrant and energy-efficient, it distills some of the children's material in it as a whole.
Medium stuff.
And just as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking: can a British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is creating a plan for a four-day working week for the British, with the same pay as for a five-day week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, now consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but are paid for five.
The group reportedly wants corporate officers to make use of savings generated from the revolution into artificial intelligence, and to make employees benefit by receiving one extra holiday.
In that case, staff could enjoy a three-day long weekend, without falling in wages.
Sources say that the idea would "pass" to the party's economic plan and its policy of improving workers' interests.
The Trades Union Congress has supported the Labour Week's shortfall of four days, as a way for workers to take advantage of changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"The change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is a goal that matches the party's approach to changing the economy for the benefit of workers and to the party's overall industrial policy."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the goal is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "The four-day workweek is not on the party's policy paper and the party is not considering introducing it."
John McDonnell, the Shadow Ministry's Trade Minister used last week's Labour Party conference to describe his ideas about social revolution within the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "unknown CEOs" and "grand collectors" of grant companies.
The Shadow Minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get their entire share back as the Labour Party government could impose a "distraction" due to alleged errors.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers in corporate governance committees and create a joint holding fund to give 10 percent of private companies' assets to their employees, who could receive £500 profits from them annually in the pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could get them to change their mind
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week-long delay in a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, and raises the question of whether or not its findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the "60 Minutes" show asked the Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“ I said when the trial began, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the allegations were made and asked, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, steadfast, harsh."
However, Graham's vote seems unchanging.
"I've made up my mind regarding Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an incredible charge to change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this I know: Brett firmly denied it," added Graham, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone she mentioned in a name could not confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don't see that anything new is going to change."
What is the International Civil Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival (Global Citizen Festival) will be held on Saturday in New York, an annual music event in which a series of superstars will perform and with a similarly influential direction; ending global poverty.
This is the seventh year the International Citizens' Festival is held and tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park, not just to listen to musical scenes from, among others, Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the festival's real goal of ending wound poverty by 2030.
The International Civil Festival, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international fighting organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To receive free tickets to the event (except for those who wish to pay for VIP tickets), concert guests had to complete various projects, or "actions", such as doing volunteer work, sending e-mails to any of the world's leaders, calling calls, or using other valid ways to help bring attention to their goal of ending poverty.
But how much success has the festival achieved, now that there are 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concerts a real way of convincing people to call for action, or is this just but one so-called 'click action' - where people feel they do something that matters by signing an online claim list or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 it has registered over 19 million "actions" from its supporters, to call for a range of different goals.
It says that these measures have helped get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion, which will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements for its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or collected.
The group estimates that the accumulated funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in the UK working to "help children to their full potential," and promised to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, sponsors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can let the social injustices to which malnutrition is heard in the past," said Tracey Ullmann, representing The Power of Nutrition to an audience at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 appeals were sent that Britain should improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide better nutrition for them.
In a list of common questions on the group's website, one of the questions is as follows: "Why do you think you can end sore poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will fail constantly.
But, we will achieve our goal, just like movements that fought for the rights of citizens and the abolition of racial segregation before us, for we are stronger together.
Among those featured at the event this year are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe.The event will be held in New York and the presenters are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy as a "citizen" to block Russian energy exports, says Interior Minister
"If necessary," Washington could use the Navy to prevent energy in Russia from reaching markets, including those in the Middle East, according to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, according to a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke argued that Russia's aid to Syria, especially since the country works at the invitation of the legitimate government there, was a pretext to explore new markets.
"I believe the reason for their presence in the Middle East is then that they want to do business with energy as in Eastern Europe and its southern parts," he is supposed to have said according to sources.
And, according to official announcement, there are ways and methods to resist it.
"The United States can use the Navy to ensure that maritime routes are open and to form an obstacle, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed a guest gathering at the invitation of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group calling itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He continued and compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying it was more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more and less practical about energy sources and replacing them with others," he said, saying Russia has just one card in its sleeve with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as a result of the Trump administration wanting to increase its export of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper alternative for European consumers.
To do this, public servants on the Trump administration, and including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to cancel participation in the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 project to lay a new energy pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly claimed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline, which will double the transport capacity of the current pipeline to $110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Russia says that Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply driven on for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy must not be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Russia's Energy Minister after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very unhappy that an outside state interfered with our power supply," said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting recently held with Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" running for the presidency in 2020, she says
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Senator said Saturday that she would "consider seriously" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider volunteering at a citizen's meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time women went to Washington and fixed our government, and then also need a woman as leader," she said according to a report from The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for the office of president."
Speaking about President Donald Trump at the meeting, Warren said that he was "taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has been uncredited by his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his nominated Supreme Court judge.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter that "Of course we have to have the FBI investigate the case before the vote goes ahead."
However, a poll published Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren's state do not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the more "likely" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her representation.
The poll showed more support for the representation of Deval Patrick, a former governor, with 38 percent saying he supported his potential representation and 48 percent saying he was against it.
Other popular Democrats discussed for a possible 2020 presidential run included former Vice President Joe Biden, and Bernie Sanders, a Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about shock stress disorder Track Palin at a campaign rally at Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"My son is going through a lot of difficulties after coming back, I feel for other families affected by trauma stress disorder and the mental wounds with which our soldiers return home," she said to the audience at an election rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "coach back only differently, they are hardened and wonder if any respect is paid for what their fellow military and air forces and other military units have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for trying to block the announcement of domestic violence, and for arms under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 State and Washington, D.C. support a challenge against a new asylum seeker policy
Eighteen states and the City of Washington support a legal challenge against a new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing gang or domestic violence for asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the city submitted a court report Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker protesting the policy, according to a report from NBC News.
The full name of the accuser in Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been given.
She said that her spouse "and his violent sons who were gang members," used violence, but U.S. government officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The Grace-supporting prosecutors described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries whose gang-related problems and domestic violence are growing more and more; the number of asylum applicants to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum seeker policy undoes a ruling made by the immigration appeals committee in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Washington Attorney General said in a statement Friday that the new policy "hunted more decades of federal and international law."
"A federal law requires that a decision be made on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule," the court report said.
Lawyers further stated in the report that the policy denying immigration was detrimental to the U.S. economy, and argued that immigrants were more likely to start businesses and "give important labor."
Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General ordered judges in immigration cases to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Those who leave their homeland due to persecution based on race, religion, ethnicity or membership of a particular community group or political opinion can apply for asylum," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Heel forces were never meant to solve all problems, not even all serious problems, that people deal with every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, as the number of dead doubles
Conditions become increasingly difficult for survivors.
"There is a lot of tension in the air," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her sick son at the relief center in the city of Palu.
“ Ambulances bring bodies here all the time.
There's little clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes and searching their water sauce belongings to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were lying outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were favored outdoors due to the continued dynamic aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he found the earthquakes shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up to the wall ruins, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go to weddings.
“ I heard my wife call for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "absurd persecution" with "arbitrary ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper to discuss mutual advantages in trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of exploiting the U.S. media to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, President of the United States spoke last Wednesday about the Chinese paper's advertisement in the Des Moines Register - the most widely sold newscast in Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. Senate elections that will be on November 6. China denies this accusation.
Trump's accusation that Peking wanted to get involved in the U.S. Senate election marked what official U.S. representatives told the Reuters news agency that there was a new level in an expanding campaign from Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington have an ever-increasing trade war, with new tolls on import products of both countries.
Chinese and American experts say that China's revenge tolls early in the trade war were designed to harm exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa in the long term, but that state exports a lot of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad stated in his posting opinion piece in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register that "China was now enhancing its persecution by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the government of China is taking advantage of the America's beloved freedom of speech tradition and our free media by publishing a cost-effective advertisement in the Des Moines Register," said Branstad in his article.
"In return, few protest voices can be found in newspaper sales booths on the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection of the different views that the Chinese might have on China's worrying economic policies, since the media are trapped under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the biggest newspapers in China got away from the offer to publish" his article, but he did not state which paper it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are destabilizing female voters before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the next midterm elections, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, who has faced charges of sexual harassment.
There have been very strong feelings surrounding this issue, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted to start voting.
"You can't back down with these things," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School Institute at the University of Syracuse, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts whether Republican Senator Jeff Flake's appeal in Arizona, in the last minute of an investigation by the FBI was enough to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget it tomorrow and not in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, the authority and spokeswoman for the liberal group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington, D.C. Newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November approaches!" as they protested on the Senate corridors when the Republicans in charge of the ruling committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The interest and enthusiasm of voters will go up out of control," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news website.
“ People will say that interest has already been great, and it is true.
But he could be greater, especially with female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who dislike the president, but rarely vote."
Analysts predicted a setback if Republicans pushed to have Kavanaugh confirmed, even before Ford's testimony describing her allegations of sexual harassment from him.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Still, a former member of the Republican Party's National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"The measure is not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be made to sit on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated it," said Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that helps vote Democrats, to the news station.
However, the U.S. appears to disagree with whom to believe after testimony from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a limited majority supports the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely believed or likely believed the testimony from Ford, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh's true or probable testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the call from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and from at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to a Guardian report.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate ruling committee last week, saying that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh carried her genitalia in front of her when they were both at a party as students at Yale University in the 1890s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the internet, plans to start a batting company to fight Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The last project of the technology myth, Inrupt, is a Solid-based company, open-source Berners-Lee's workshop.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is saved and which people have permission to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly commented that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to do this now," he said of the baton company.
‘This is a historic moment.'
The program uses technology from Solid to enable people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It has a list of contacts, to-do lists, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work-related tools.
It is similar to the fact that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available to sites in one browser and all simultaneously.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it a "personal power advantage using data."
According to John Bruce, president of the company, the idea that Inrupt is that the company provides access, process, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security contractor that was purchased by IBM, several developers who were hired as contractors to work on the project, and a group of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own independent programs with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not have talks with "Facebook and Google on whether to launch a complete change that would put their current business model on the head overnight.
"We don't ask them for permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published Saturday on Medium that Inrupt had the "target of creating energy in business and ecosystems that help protect the honesty and quality of the new Solid-based web."
Berners-Lee converted the network in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and president of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while establishing Inrupt.
"I'm full of optimism for the next season of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest and custodian of the Victoria Cross since World War I honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victoria Cross during the First World War a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
Father Bernard Vann who held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army, received the cross on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later, and he was never told that he had received the highest honour of the British Army.
Two of his grandsons unveiled a memorial to him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "delightfully symbolic" that the monument was exposed exactly 100 years from his grandfather's honorary achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his troops on 29 September 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin Canal "through extremely thick fog and under heavy fire from artillery and machine guns."
Later he ran to the firing line, and with "great courage" he led the line forward before attacking a cannon of his own, overpowering three soldiers.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's exploits were "something I could never do, but something that makes you humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a flower wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt it was "a great honour to participate in the parade", adding that "the virtues of a true hero are shown with the support so many people show."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, got instead to see Gurru pig
Just imagine, having stayed up all night to see an overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied seeing the main event.
The program featured 13 fights from San Jose, six of which were on the main schedule and were shown live throughout the night in the UK on the Channel 5 channel.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers received a surprise when the broadcast changed to Gurru pig.
Some were dissatisfied after staying up all night to watch the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to the children's material as "a sort of sick joke."
"In accordance with official rules, the material was not appropriate to the audience at 6:00 pm in the morning so they had to switch to children's material," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Gurra pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator said they would review their timetables and take UK viewers into account in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay that we could probably sort this out," Coker said.
“ But it’s 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there, and we can’t solve this until Sunday, which is Monday, with them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a number of text messages were sent back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't so, it was a public problem.
I can promise you this won't happen the next time.
We limit the night to five fights instead of six, as usual, but we tried too hard and got ahead of ourselves.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inadequate" due to sexual orientation
Olympic dipper Tom Daley says he felt inadequacy towards other people growing up because of his sexual orientation, but that they encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said that he did not realize that "he was different from others" until he went to high school."
On the Desert Island Discs radio program on the Radio 4 channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley stated that he talked about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that the parenting role reduced his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular director, has taken several months off due to illness.
Daley faced an extravagance in Laverne's first episode, saying that he felt like he was a "lesser man" than everyone else when he was a child because "it wasn't agreed in society to be fond of both boys and girls."
He said, "Up to today, these feelings of feeling inferior and different have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was 'something,' he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when his sexuality was realized.
The double Olympic bronze barrister has made a lot of contributions as an LGBT supporter, using his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he would be heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others "hope."
The World Champion triple stated that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
‘When a man goes through so much at an early age' - but he participated in his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar successes and difficulties.
The pair adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all-life views" had culverted.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about winning a gold medal," he said.
“ You know, there are more important things than gold medals in the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son is baptised at the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had got their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until his breath stopped and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn't invincible," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"I just knew I had dreamed of this all my life, dipping in front of the audience at home at the Olympics..it doesn't feel better," he said.
It was also an inspiration for the selection of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. British local time.
Mickelson in bad shape and made to sit on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat the record on Sunday as he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find back his old beats so that the score is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the competition for the 12th time, a record, was left to sit on the bench after the decision of captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball matches and four-ball games on Saturday.
Instead of being the centerpiece of the action, as it has been so often before for the United States, the day is divided by the five-fold champion between being a cheerleader and practicing the playing rhythms on the field, hoping to correct what he is agitating.
Mickelson, 48, was never the one to shoot straight with the droid, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, as long glare often punishes for bad shots.
And not enough that the golf course is a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, the winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari has rookie Tommy Fleetwood on a team and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below as they take the first game of 12 singles games, get a good start, Mickelson's game could make a difference.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he could hardly say much else.
"He perfectly understood the role he had today, patted me on the back and put his arms around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“ He has a high level of confidence.
He's in the hall of fame and he's been so much compensation for the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but that's how it ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everybody else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in a number of played games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never achieved quite as high as other achievements on his record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said that his presence had a certain vague effect on the team.
"He's funny, he's cynical, witty, he enjoys making fun of people and it's great to have him in the team room," he explained.
“ I think the younger players loved to tease him too this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe knows that a great advantage can disappear quickly
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good advantage for the last day of individual competition in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane first played a game in Valderrama in 1997, where a side under captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but just managed to squeeze forward a win at the end with the least possible scoring difference, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 win.
"A man constantly reminds himself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama, we had a big advantage in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but only right then," said Bjorn, seen here in a picture, after watching the 2018 vintage win 5-3 both on Friday and Saturday, reaching the advantage of 10-6 on the Le Golf National field.
History will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
We'll make every effort tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not over until all the scores are on the table.
We have our goal, and it's trying to win this cup, we focus on it.
I've always said this, I've focused on the 12 players on our team, but we're extremely aware of our opponents on the other team - the best golfers in the world."
Bjorn was thrilled with how his players had done a difficult job, and he added: “I never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow it is the performance of the individuals that matters, and it is another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's going well, but when you play one, all your skills are tried as a golfer.
It is the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now a man leaves his partner behind and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will seek his players to do better in individual games than with a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this big transition on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe performed the "miracle in Medinah."
‘I remember every goddamn word,' he replied advising how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had encouraged his players on for the last day.
“ We have 12 important games to play tomorrow, but you want to start fast as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When that crawl reaches build-up, it causes a lot of pressure on the games that are in the middle.
We lined up our players accordingly and let them play as we feel will go best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and plays against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
"I chose these players in this order because I think they tire all the way through," Bjorn said of his choice of players in the individual competition.
Germany's new warship postponed yet again
The latest German Navy warship should have been built in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until the first time next year due to broken systems and ever rising costs, according to local news reports.
The building on the "Rheinland-Palatinate," the lead ship of the brand new warships of Baden-Wuerttemberg-class, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to sources from a military spokesperson who spoke to the Die Zeit paper.
The ship had been scheduled to be intercepted by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after delivery plagued the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the Bremen-class battleships, which have arrived for their years.
They should be equipped with a more powerful cannon, many anti-aircraft and ship defense rockets, and camouflage techniques such as reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer use times—it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, constant delays mean that these warships of the latest type - which are said to enable Germany to show its strength at sea - will be already obsolete when they are finally taken into action, says Die Zeit.
The F125 warship made the news last year when the German Army officially refused to take over the frigate and returned it back to the Blohm & Voss slip in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but German media spoke of multiple women seriously "failing in software and hardware" which made the warship useless if it was sent on a campaign.
Software flaws were particularly important, as a Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleship will be led by a crew of 120, half that of Bremen-class warships.
The ship was also found to be far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to make additions to it in the future.
The 7,000 ton ship "Rheinland-Palatinate" is believed to be twice as heavier as a ship in a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from hardware flaws, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - has begun to cause problems.
It reportedly reached an euro of 3.1 billion (£3.6 billion), but was originally to be €2.2 billion.
Problems that plague the latest ships are particularly important in light of warnings that German dominance at sea is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was actually becoming a "superceder with functional ships."
The representative said that the problem had surfaced over time, as older ships were decommissioned but no ships took their place.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships could be used by the Navy.
National Trust Conservation Association spy on secret life of bats
A new study conducted on land in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the landscape as they hunt for food.
The results are hoped to shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation measures.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland's Conservation Association, will monitor different species of bats in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the leather flaps over the period.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also take patrols with hand-held sensors.
Experts will record all recordings to determine the frequency of the calls given by the bats, and what species do what.
A map of the habitat and report will then be published to create an accurate picture of their behavior on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, a night spent conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of habitat is most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain woodland for bats and other associated species.
The number of bats has declined significantly over the last century in Scotland and throughout Britain.
They are under threat from construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce habitat.
Windmills and lights can also cause risks, including fly paper and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from home cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, the ears are much more useful than the eyes when it comes to catching prey, because they are accustomed to fishing at night.
They used advanced rock-centric techniques to find insects and objects that are on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization employs ten experts, who perform regular observations, nest inspections, and sometimes rescue operations.
The association has even set up Scotland's first and only bat peaceland at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species have a home.
David Thompson, the ranch overseer says he is a perfect area for them.
"The scene here at Threat is great for bats," he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of grown trees, and lots of good habitat.
But there are still a lot of unknowns about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before maintenance at residences, as possible unintentional destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 female bats and young and destroy all bats in the area.
Bats are protected and are forbidden to kill, harass, or disrupt, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative at the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don't know how well many of their species are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare lawsuits against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called allegations against him of rape "false news" and says that people want to "wake attention" using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The frontman for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is reported to have paid her $375,000 afterwards for quieting about the incident, according to a report by Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, said in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers that they were "false news."
“ No, no, no, no, no.
This which was said today is false news," said the world champion fivefold to the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to become famous using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable release of suspicions relating to privacy," according to the Reuters news agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would require compensation for "injury of the same amount and the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he supposedly raped her in the anus, according to documents filed before the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell to his knees after a misdemeanor incident, telling her that he was a "99 percent good man" who fell into temptation because of the "1 percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex, but that it was with the consent of both.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and had photos of her injuries taken in hospital, but finally agreed to reconciliation outside the courtroom because she was "death-raid of reprisals" and was concerned about becoming "demonstrated publicly."
She says she now wants to cancel the reconciliation because she is still in shock after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to have occurred, and this summer he crossed over to Italian giant Juve on a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain would "forever regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain would "be sorry forever" if it lost its position as an international leader among car manufacturers after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "a concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily cease production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact from delays at the border if Brexit without a contract would become a reality would cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis automobiles, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union customers.
"My opinion is that if the UK bounces out of the EU at the end of March, we will see the manufacturing facilities at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concern over exit from the EU without agreement on how inter-county trade is to take place, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are subject to what car manufacturers say are party chain risks if Brexit without a contract becomes reality.
Toyota's production line is based on the acceptance of 'last-minute', with parts being delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars manufactured on order.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions to the border which the industry believes could lead to delays and lack of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a dayslager at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers program for future relations with the EU "is specifically targeted to prevent these views at the border."
"We have to have a deal. we want to get the best deal that allows us to enjoy not just success in modern times, but as an opportunity we can take advantage of," he said on a radio show on BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers as well, shows that we must be able to continue with extremely effective destinations.
Toyota could not say how long their production would stop, but warned that, in the longer term, increased costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trustee of the union at the factory, said that his colleagues were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs go away, they never come back.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed an accurate and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU."
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House declared on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, the Assistant State Attorney, could be "annulled again by one week" now the disagreement due to Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the Special Prosecutor, who investigates Russian involvement in elections, connections between Trump's assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice at the hands of the President.
For weeks, rumors have gone on in Washington about whether Trump will fire a lieutenant state attorney, thus endangering Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times stated that Rosenstein had discussed carrying recorders on to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of overturning the president using the 25th supplement of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, among reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "almost doesn't want to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to not be at the same time as an audience with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has sued him for sexual harassment, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sander, Trump's media agent, was broadcasting on the Fox News Sunday show.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date for him has not yet been set, it may be this week, and I believe it is possible for him to be delayed by another week because of everything else going on with the Supreme Court.
But we see and it is always a pleasure to inform the press."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Feature director Chris Wallace asked about the reason.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not due to dissatisfaction that television journalists had a "showmanship," however she said, "I don't disagree with the fact that they have a showmanship."
She then gave evidence that a direct relationship between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president answers more media questions than any other president has done before," she said, without reference to sources, "We have reviewed these figures."
Media conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the media has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it and you've seen us do a lot of it over the past few weeks and it will replace media meetings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders visiting him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown the reason in New York this week, when he showed off restraint and in an era of strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
The EU health minister writes to staff within the health system in Scotland over concerns over Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to declare the nation's appreciation and wish it to continue to work after Brexit has passed through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter when less than six months is until Britain walks out of the EU.
The Scottish government has already promised to meet costs for work permit applications for EU citizens working within the public service sector.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter: “Over the summer, talks between Britain and the EU over dismissal have continued and decision making is expected this fall.
The British government has also been working to prepare if it is possible there will be no contract.
I know this must be a great time of uncertainty for all of you.
That's why I want to put it forward again how much I value the work of the whole staff, no matter what its nationality.
Partnerships from the EU and elsewhere bring precious experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care jobs and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is indeed your home and we want very much that you will stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, lineman for the Tennessee State Tigers had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss game against the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, according to a report from Mike Organ, a Tennessean journalist.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State head coach told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sidelines and fell down there," said Reed.
Trainers and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before being put on stretchers and carried off for closer inspection.
A Tennessee State Representative told Chris Harris, a radio broadcaster for WSMV in Nashville, Tennesse, that Abercrombie was done in surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was "no information about the type or severity of the injury yet" and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, a senior in school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after immigrating from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before going off, which raised his total number of tackles to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying UK real estate
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying UK real estate; the extra money will be used to assist the homeless, according to the Conservative Party's new plan
The action will undo the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Raised stamp fees will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
A government fund plans to raise £120 million a year - to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy a UK property; the extra money will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will announce this today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to undo the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by promising housing at affordable prices and further taxing high-income people.
Individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK have to pay higher stamp fees, and the surplus will go to the government's actions to assist the homeless.
The increase - which is in addition to current stamp fees, including the increase that was put on two years ago in an extra home and real estate purchase for rent - could be up to three percent.
A government fund estimates that the increase will raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new buildings in London are purchased by foreign parties, but this causes price increases and makes it more difficult for those wanting to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many more affluent areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become "dream towns" due to the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp fees to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping real estate prices high by purchasing land but not using them, and urged May to cancel quotas in homes at affordable prices to fix Britain's "household shame".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of considered housing improvements, including rental supervision and an end to eviction from rental housing without cause.
He also wants to give advice more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would devote myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first season - that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that means fixing our ruined real estate market.
Britain's Doors will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it cannot be correct that it is as easy for foreign parties as a company headquartered in a foreign country to buy homes as it is for able British nationals.
For many, the dream of their own premises has become far too distant, and the shame of homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to train Scotland"
Jack Ross, Sunderland's coach, says that it is his "most important goal" to become Scotland's coach sometime.
This 42-year-old Scotsman now enjoys the challenge of blowing new life into the North-East club which currently sits third in the First Division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after rejoining St. Mirren in the Scottish Premier League last season.
“ I wanted to play for my nation as a player.
I injured my knee and thus it was over," said Ross in an interview with Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland often in Hampden with my dad, as a child, and it is always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I was successful in coaching a league team."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coaches include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic club coach said he felt no fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names at such a large club, but he had previously turned down coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
‘As it is, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘Can I bring this club back to the elite?'
This club definitely belongs in the Premier League because of its structure and facilities," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get him there, but I'd probably only think of myself as a success here if I got the club back up there."
Ross has only three years of experience, as a coach, after a season as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a coaching staff for Hearts.
He then assisted Alloa in recovering from falling to the third division, and converted St Mirren, who was falling by league, to league champion the following season.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he ever was in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"This was probably a real breakthrough," he says of the season when he became Alloa's coach.
“ I really believed that my coaching job suited me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was doing fine, I had a decent income from it and enjoyed a decent success.
But change can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still go through it in terms of stress and pressure from the job, but the coaching work simply seems right for me.
I always wanted to train and now I do, I've never felt better about myself in all my adulthood."
The entire interview can be listened to on the show Sportsound on Sunday, 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13.00 p.m. to British local time
The best time for beer is at 17.30 pm on Saturdays, according to a poll.
The heat wave this summer has proved profitable for British bars struggling, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales at pubs and bars increased 2.7 percent in July, while sales at restaurants dropped 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to the month of June, when bar sales increased 2.8 percent, except for restaurants selling even less.
The sale fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and deteriorated again in July.
POWs and bars, aiming mainly at drink sales, stood by far the best with more upturn while restaurants went downhill.
POWs selling food also had difficulty in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out drinking.
Sales of drinks by pubs and bars increased 6.6 percent for the month, but food sales declined by three percent."
Paul Newman, of the RSM analyst, said: “These results are a continuation of the fluctuation we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact from important social events or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales by out-of-home markets.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a decline in sales of 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful on top of continued cost-induced pressures.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for diners, and only time will reveal whether temperate temperatures, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
Total growth in sales at pubs and restaurants, including those at newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting how openings have slowed.
Coffer Peach Tracer, the monitoring company with sales in the British pub and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups, with a combined roll of £9 billion and is the industrial target for the sector.
One in five children has classified accounts on social media they hide from their parents
One in five children, as low as 11 years old, have classified accounts on social media they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the results of a survey.
A poll of 20,000 students showed an increase in "virtual Insta" pages
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students say they have an 'main' account they show parents
One in five children, as low as 11 years old, make classified accounts on social media they keep secret from adults.
A poll of 20,000 students showed a large increase in "virtual Insta" accounts - a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has added to concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "primary" account to show parents, as well as having secret accounts.
One mother, who fell down on her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, found a teenager urging others to "rape me."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Parliament of the Private Principals (HMC), showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two bills and half of them admitted to having secret bills.
HMC chairman Mike Buchanan said, "It's a concern that so many teenagers are tempted to create areas online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes "the voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive officer at the annual General Meeting of the Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful freestyle, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee said the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her great experience in the international field over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect within sporting communities in Scotland, the United Kingdom and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money getting her on the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport on in Scotland."
The American, who won among the annrs the 200 metres and 400 metres race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but has a total of four Olympic golds, and is now a regular guest at the BBC, was paralyzed after receiving a transient stroke.
On Twitter, he wrote: “One month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would reveal whether I recovered and then how much.
It's been a tough job, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and do athletic exercises today!
Thank you for your words of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers to cows causes online disagreements
A company that produces breast pumps is now being spoken online due to an advertisement that carries lactating mothers to cows that are milked.
The company Elvie published a nod to mark the presentation of what is said to be "the world's first silent brat that can be carried on the outside". the advertisement is inspired by music videos and is to show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are breast-feeding.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cum to a song with lyrics such as, 'Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail on me' and 'If you didn't notice, these aren't poultry but my breasts.'"
The fix continues: "Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk out of the poultry."
However, the ad published on the company's Facebook page has caused online publicity.
The video has 77,000 viewers and hundreds of remarks and has received varying responses from viewers, who say many people that it garnered with the "horror" that follows the dairy industry.
“ It’s a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to get calf-fed and carry to produce milk, except what the calves are taken away from them just days after they are born," said one of the remarks.
The Elvie breast pump fits comfortably in a bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another observer wrote: “Obviously difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who get to keep their children?"
Another added, "This ad is totally out of line with time."
Others came to the defense of the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "acutely funny."
“ I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one of these if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one of the viewers.
Another said, "This is a fun ad that is directed at mothers who pump milk (often in workplaces or in the toilet) and feel like 'cum'."
This is not an advertisement that compliments or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, the women's group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their bras.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on many women saying that they feel like cows as they pump milk out.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes, and fits comfortably into a bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a fellow owner and head of Mother, said: “Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a prominent presentation that would attract publicity.
By comparing women to cows, we wanted to direct the cast light to the breast pump and all of its challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has made the news.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared at a fashion show for designer Martha Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to camps along the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in custody has suddenly increased even though the number of people crossing the border monthly has remained roughly the same; part of the reason is that the harsh wording and policies put forward by the Trump government have made it more difficult to bring the children into a temporary fetus.
Typically, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and have feared putting their chances of remaining in the country at risk, by volunteering to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults within the home would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration federation.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an officer within the Immigration and Customs Commission, testified before the Senate, saying that his agency had arrested a number of people who applied to foster single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on a criminal record.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in a home that fosters children, are illegal in the country, and much of them are illegal immigrants on a criminal record.
‘That's why we continue to seek those individuals,' Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children's cases more quickly, representatives announced new rules requiring some of the children to appear in a courtroom within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous criteria, according to staff working in the act.
Many of them will attend through a video conference, rather than in person, to argue for their legal status before a judge of immigration.
Those children who are judged unfit for entry into the country are quickly deported.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports published by the system over the past few months.
Advocates said that these problems were even more likely in a larger institution such as in Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice although a child has difficulty, due to the number of them.
They added that the move of the children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them spiritually or say goodbye to a friend could add to the shock many of them already face.
Syria tells the "military forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Walid al-Moualem, foreign minister, also said in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even if the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops are illegal in Syria, under the false assumption that they fight terrorism, and that "they will be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to parliament.
Moualem firmly claimed that the "war on terrorism was almost over" in Syria, with over 360,000 people having died since 2011 and millions having had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to wage this sacred struggle until we clean up all Syrian territories 'of both terrorist groups and 'all illegal foreign parties.'"
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, with most of them training and advising both Kurdish troops and Syrian Aröbs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-raised country.
In terms of refugee issues, Moualem said that circumstances were good enough for them to return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "broadening out reasonless fears" that encouraged refugees to stay away.
"We have called on international society and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They make politics out of something that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. ambassadors say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral zone at the last major stronghold of the opposition has created an opportunity to continue political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack from Syrian forces sponsored by the Russians, on the region where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the treaty has a "distinguished final deadline" and expressed hope that military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, who have ties to Al-Qaeda, and that those "words are eliminated."
Staffan de Mistura, the U.N. ambassador, hopes to be able to arrange the first meetings with a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition, to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and pay the street for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, and said that its activities should be limited to "going over the provisions of the current government," and warned all interventions.
The reasons Trump will win another election period
According to that argument, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 re-election, unless charges and scandals end his presidential career, as many liberal observers probably hope to do.
In what would be undoubtedly "the most dramatic end to a presidential career ever!"
At present, the audience does not wear any fatigue marks on it.
Since 2014, ratings at the best time have more than doubled to $1.05 million at CNN, and nearly tripled to $1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best, an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's episode, "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about an employee within the government who becomes president after the House of Assembly is completely destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and writer of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another hypothesis.
She remembers a trip in a taxi in Boston for the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' Ms. Scovell said to me.
There's an entertainment value in the mess.
However, unlike what is shown on television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can unite and the health of the international economy.
Only those viewers who enjoy the most privilege can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you look at the sixth time at a group of experts arguing Bob Woodward's use of "very close" sources for his book "Fear," or a $15,000 jacket made of ostrich leather that Paul Manafort wore ("a body that is fed with arrogance," said the Washington Post), and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's exact biological descriptions of Mr. Trump.
At least I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A lot of what he does and lets a man feel like a reality show, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the show "Pawn Stars", as he discussed the staff roll in Trump's show and the daily changes in the storyline (e.g., starting a fight with N.F.L. and compliments towards Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one episode, or you lose the thread.
When I made contact with Mr. Fleiss, there was 26 degrees of heat and sunshine outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed indoors and watched MSNB while filming CNN.
He could not break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Supreme Court's future was at stake.
"I remember when we were creating all these crazy elements in the old days and people said, 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' Mr Fleiss said to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out people were right."

Money on the Outside Flood in the Nearest Elections of the Middle Ages
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district sees the money flowing, thanks to reorganization in electoral areas, leading to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area sends forward Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the second electoral area in a special election last summer.
Lamb is running against fellow Representative, Republican Keith Rothfuss, now representing the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th District.
The maps over electoral areas were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old electoral areas were organized in Republican favour and that it violates the constitution.
The race in the new 17th electoral district has been the start of a race in campaign funding between the main funding bodies of both parties, the Democratic Select Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Select Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a March special election for the 18th District of Pennsylvania, but many watched that election.
The Republicans had previously warmed that seat for more than a decade, and Donald Trump, president of the electoral area with a 20-point difference.
Political experts have given Democrats a little edge.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support of China, but then cancelled.
State ambassadors noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little objection from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until co-owners drove out the Trump Co-operative's management team.
State Department representatives decided to call back the U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to a "new decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, the Ministry's spokeswoman in a statement early this month.
However, sanctions were considered exclusively against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for relief work in 2017, including for drug control, development work, and economic support.
The sanctions, which were proposed and included a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the issue of residency, would have been painful for the Central American country, with high unemployment rates and high murder rates.
As insider meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives delayed a conference on security and economic success and were to follow a similar meeting that was held last year and believed to be a step forward in action to prevent people from moving to the United States.
However, in mid-September, representatives from the top rankings made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and consequently ended all speculation about sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, which is scheduled to take place in mid-October, as a sign of how important it is to the board, the ambassadors said.
The three American envoys also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton declined to discuss the details of the debates described by the three U.S. Representatives, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the internal argument against being allowed to remain anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the board and also spoke about the case against anonymity.

The next scandal could be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump's possible actions to block justice, but to that accusation lie numerous public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller also turns his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress is to be governed by another party, Trump may have to be responsible for it, about the time he prepares to meet his voters again, and perhaps a jury appointed to his peers.
However, these are extremely uncertain, and I do not wish to hypothesize that Trump's fall is unambiguous, nor the fall of his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938, German councillors were ready to plunder Hitler's power, only if Western countries had resisted him and supported the Munich Czechoslovaks.
We failed to do so and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of disaster that followed.
History revolves around such important points and speeds up or stalls for the unstoppable advance of democracy.
The Americans are facing several such important points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this paper reported that last year he had proposed making classified recordings of the president and discussed whether he was ineligible for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is not correct.
"How will we respond if the newly asked FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is confirmed to be a Supreme Court judge despite probable allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the middle period which will have Mr. Trump shoulder responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I believe we will not fall, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Jewish from Czechoslovakia, was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that used to sit in my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I but look positively at our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Rangers teammate, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get out of the European League's G group. Rangers made an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season until the match against Villareal which ended in a 2-2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can take advantage of the playoffs as a jumpboard for better success.
"It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team," said Dorrans, 31.
“ We started the game with the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Perhaps we could have squeezed out a win at the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came strong into the second half and played better.
Thursday is the second important night for the European Division.
I hope we can make three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they were doing great in their last game, but with the audience supporting us, I'm sure we're going to swell this up and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that occurred at the club itself, but now there is a good feeling on the spot.
The team is good and the boys enjoy themselves, the training is good.
I hope we can get further ahead now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women Lose Sleep Out of Fear of Losing Retirement Savings
Although the poll participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few with their family members discussed it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey, said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they would discuss this with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the right steps to have those conversations," said Holly Snyder, deputy director of Nationwide's life insurance department.
That's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not make your wishes clear, you cannot prepare your family for care.
Discuss with your adviser and your family about where and when you receive care, because these options can change a lot in terms of costs.
Include your financial adviser: Your adviser can also assist you in finding a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay costs, or self-assured with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal differences in advance.
Get a responsible person for your health care so that you can nominate someone you trust to oversee your health care and ensure that health care providers comply with your wishes if you are unable to say them directly out of your own hands.
Also consider getting a provost for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and arrange for your accounts to be paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and is on his way to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Give that information exactly in a written schedule so that you are ready.
"It's not just about the finances, but also about who the doctors are," Martin said.
“ What are the drugs?
Who will look after the dog?
Have that plan ready."
Man shot multiple times with an air pistol in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air pistol while on his way home on foot after having an outing.
The victim is a man in his 50s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Representatives describe the shooting, which occurred at around 02.30 a.m. British local time, as "an attack at random."
The victim did not see his attacker.
The man was not fatally wounded and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 were killed after a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, representatives said, and the number of dead is expected to rise.
As all communications lie down, aid workers have been unable to provide any information from Donggala County, an area north of Palu and lies closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left their homes in Palu after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi District and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.The estimated number of inhabitants was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a county covering more than 380 km of shoreline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, a sub-region government area, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi District, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel mines are also important in the region, but they are most of them in Morowali, which is on the coast facing Sulawesi.
Flood waves have flooded Palu and Donggala several times in the past century, according to the Indonesian disaster agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed when a tsunami struck and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia sits on the active fire cycle of the Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra struck on 26 December, triggering a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people throughout the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds die on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 on Richter struck near the city of Padang, which is the capital of a province in western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on Richter struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, raising up to 10 meters high tsunamis that destroyed numerous villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya County in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people recalled the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was formed this time, but over 100 were killed as buildings collapsed.
2018: Large quakes ride across the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mainly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former Governor of Alaska and presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for attempting to block the announcement of domestic violence and resist arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police, published Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin took the phone from a friend when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is held at Mat-Su station where he is awaiting an audience in court, and he is being held against $500 bail, according to a KTUU report.
He attended a court hearing on Saturday, declaring that he was "not guilty, definitely" when asked to declare guilt or innocence, according to the news station.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, meaning he could be sentenced to prison for up to one year and had to pay a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a class B felony, which is punishable by a single day in prison and a $1,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin called police to report on the alleged attack.
The case is currently under treatment for the Alaskan provincial court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, for obstructing the announcement of domestic violence, and for carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of surrender soldiers in 2016 after she blamed trauma stress disorder on her son's violent behavior, after his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake on Richter triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems lie down and the number of the dead is expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just past the middle of Sulawesi Island, which runs northeast from Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing when the incident happened now run around on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected New York City terrorist attacker
New York prosecutors want the death penalty over Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of participating in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people; this is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violations of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is believed to have rented a Home Depot truck to attack people on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, where he drove down pedestrians and bikers in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "willingly" and caused serious bodily trauma "willingly", according to the declaration of will to use the death penalty, which was documented in the Southern District Court of New York.
Both of these charges can lead to possible capital punishment, according to the court document.
Many weeks after the attack, Saipov's federal court charged 22 teams, including eight counts of murder for criminal purposes, which are typically used by prosecutors in charges against organized crime organizations.Saipov was also charged with violent crime and for destroying an automobile.
The attack involved a "digital planned plan" said the accusers and described Sapiov's act as "horrible, cruel, and immoral."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov became the cause of physical injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the will statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is a decade since the southern province of New York last took capital punishment cases for treatment.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a 1953 New York court case, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of practicing spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both euthanized in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He said to an investigator that he was comfortable with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had got the idea of the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to show ISIS the flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 teams of the charge.
David Patton, one of the public defenders of Saipov, said that they were "consciously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of agreeing to a declaration of guilt against life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, will only extend the shock of this event for all partisans," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead negotiations due to Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to "work the army of the people" today at a protest by a conference of conservatives.
This former leader of Ukip said that politicians must "find pressure" from skeptics about the EU, at the same time as one of Theresa May's delegates suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter Bone said at the Birmingham protest march that Britain "was going out" now if Mr Farage was the leader for Brexit.
However, the challenge that May faces to reconcile deep differences between her own team members came to light even better as conservatives, who wish to remain in the EU, took part in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has trouble keeping his Chequers plan on track and is subject to criticism from those in favor of Brexit, those in opposition, and the EU.
The Allies claimed that she will continue to struggle to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - forcing those opposed to Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between her plan and "disagreement".
Mr. Bone said to Leave Means Leave the protest march in Solihull that he wanted to "lost the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to participate and assume responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have gone out now," he said.
The Senator from Wellingborough added, "I will support Brexit but we must get rid of the Chequers plan."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone dismissed indications that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British public has changed their minds and wants to stay is absolutely false."
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative supporter of Brexit, was also on the protest march, saying to reporters: “I simply want to say, ‘ Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the public and the opposition will not vote with it, enjoying unpopularity among our party members and activists who are on the streets and voting for us.
Please, cancel the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added, "Prime Ministers keep the job when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that the politicians must be allowed to "find pressure" if they were to defect from the decision made following the 2016 vote.
"This is now about trust between us - our people - and our political party," he said.
"They want to try to betray Brexit and we're gathered here today to say to them 'we won't let you get away with this'."
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to let your political party, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel pressure.
We forge an army of the public in this country which gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-sufficient, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest march in Birmingham which ended with a two-hour protest rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved flags of conservatives against Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis, from the Labour Party, made fun of the Conservatives because of security problems that arose in the party's telephone program when the conference was opened.
"These are the people who tell us they can have all computer systems in order and all technology for Canada plus plus, for borders without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders," he added.
“ It’s a complete scandal.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren intends to "consider seriously" running for the presidency.
Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Senator, says she intends to "consider serious representation to the presidency" after the November election.
According to a Boston Globe report, the Democrat from Massachusetts discussed his future at a citizen's meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has infrequently criticized U.S. President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focus of speculation that she could run against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with residents in her district, since Trump took office.
One member of the meeting asked her if she had plans to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then also need a woman as leader."
Arrest after fatal shooting of Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, but he was shot dead Friday.
Baton Rouge Police reported the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously released a video of the shooting on Friday asking for assistance in identifying a man seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died of it," said Murphy J. Paul, police chief, to the press on Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde came to his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being on the scene, with weapons in his gear, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without trouble and detained by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was two yards tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, He played in 32 games, including 10 in the starting lineup last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and achieving 2.9 hits per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the winning place on order from their team.
It was clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas gained a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton at before launch on Saturday, that orders from Mercedes' team would play a major part in the competition.
Bottas got a good start in the startup, almost leaving Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight against his teammate.
Vettel went first in the pit and left Hamilton to drive into the round at the end of the group, but it should have been able to determine the final.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton got ahead after a close confrontation in which Ferrari's driver was forced to leave the inside side after being in danger of remaining, after defensive attempts in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started back in the group and was seventh at the end of the first lap, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race as he delayed changing tyres in an attempt to finish quickly and surpass Kimi Raikkonen, reaching fourth place.
He eventually went to the pit on lap 44 but could not increase the pace of the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did an impressive job all weekend and was a true gentleman letting me out of his way.
The team has done a fantastic job to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
Donald Trump, U.S. President made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein during a Saturday meeting, due to her claims that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, with an accusation against Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not directly discuss the testimony from Ford before the Senate ruling committee; instead, he said that what went on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and cruel and unverified."
"The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and cruel and untrue," he said.
“ When you see the lights and the leaks, and then you say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein: Did you leak that?
Do you remember her reply... did you leak the document—" "Oh, ha, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Now wait a minute.
Let's just... no, we don't lay it down," he said and imitated the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, stating the allegations from Ford against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked in early September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
‘She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did as she asked me to.'
But her denial did not seem to go well into the president, who said at the Saturday meeting: “Let me tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she leaked nothing, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and alleged that the Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations in their favor.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods must be used.
You see the cruelty, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to rolled over to gain power and control," said the president, according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League Division: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars improved for their loss on Friday in the Elite League Division against the Belfast Giants, by winning the following game, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two goal lead after goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised for the homers, but Dwyer then brought the Giants back over.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen then secured their victory.
This was the third losing game of the season for Adam Keefe's team in the Elite League league, having won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game between the teams in the season, and the Giants had won the three games prior.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute as the clock showed 3.35, after a assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford then came with a assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
There was then a lot to be in the first minutes and Sullivan brought the homers back into the game when the clock showed 13.10 and Cownie then equalised after a assist from Matt Marquardt in the fifteenth minute.
Dwyer made sure to get the Giants over before halftime when he scored his second goal of the game at the end of the first play-third.
The home team folded and Bouchard equalised again after goal when they were one man over in the 27th minute of the second quarter.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together, helping Nielsen bring Dundee over for the first time in the game late in the second quarter, and he secured his team victory with the fifth goal when half of the last play-third had passed.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, take on Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller kills to ensure hundreds of passengers on plane escape earthquake"
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a wave of noise as a result.
Large aftershocks continue to plague the area, and many are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
The 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, even though his colleagues had fled the control tower which fluctuated violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway at the time of the earthquake, could definitely succeed.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision has potentially saved hundreds of lives, according to an ABC News report in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are very sad to hear this," he added.
Authorities fear the number of the dead could exceed a thousand, when the country's disaster agency says access is restricted to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of dead is being increased as many bodies are still under rubble and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six feet high waves have caused massive destruction in Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
The military and passenger aircraft are working to bring in relief supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said in an interview with Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with a body.
There is little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross strives to find survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all of the missions related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said in a report from CNN.
Earlier this year, earthquakes hit Lombok, Indonesia, where over 550 people died.
Crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says the same is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline, which owned an airplane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in an announcement that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unaware of the cancellation of a single male passenger.
The airline claimed to work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an attempt to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Representatives said Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that the condition of all of them was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of the incidents was.
The airline and the United States Navy both said that the aircraft landed in the lagoon just ahead of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane's approach had been extremely low.
"It was really good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others could wade the waist-deep water and reach emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said that the flight crews had been scared and shouting and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The United States Navy said that sailors who were working a short distance away from repairing a dock also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people ashore, before the aircraft sank in approximately 100 feet (30 m) of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in the plane crashes of PNG-registered aircraft disciplines over the past two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors completed their case Saturday in a re-enactment case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to puzzle together the trips of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous claims, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was at Chamber's house at the same time that he claimed to have been with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified Saturday, saying he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was "a lie, because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile data showed that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls and her contact information from her phone.
"He destroyed her from his life," Hale said.
It is estimated that the defenders will deliver their final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be filed with the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's a conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio want to combat negative opinion towards the music genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop distanced itself from its origins as it contained political messages and dealt with social issues.
They want to seek the origin again and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen recent upturns in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A nurse in New York is suing a couple for expulsion after a "prejudicial" text message
A nurse in New York is suing a couple for unlawful expulsion after she accidentally received a text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The pair refuse to be prejudiced, likening the lawsuit to "indulgence."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up for work for the first time in 2016.
‘NEEEEEIIIII RECONSTITUTION’ wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the messages to her husband, she sent them to Ms. Maurice twice.
After discovering her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms Maurice, saying that their former nurse, who was black, had performed poorly, and that she had expected to get a Filipino woman, according to a report from the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for his only day of work and then sent home in a Uber car.
Maurice now sues the couple and wants compensation for the expulsion, to the amount of $350 per day for the six-month job she had originally been hired for, even though no contract has been signed.
"I wanted to show them that this is not how you should do it," she said in an interview with the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple have protested the allegations that they are prejudiced, saying that it was the right thing to do in the case to fire Maurice, because they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“ My wife sent her a message she was not going to tell.
She's not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced people," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“ But who would trust their children with someone after showing rudeness, even if it was a surprise?
Her newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to "financing," and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in "a very difficult situation."
“ Are you going to attack someone in this condition?
It's not very beautifully done," said Plasco, who works in the investment sector.
The case is still in court, but the public has made harsh remarks about the pair on social media, scolding it for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would have difficulty liking a talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put herself in the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
"It's very funny now that we know of Paddington's enormous success."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a small toy bear, had taken the rejection of his work with calm positiveness, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "loosely hurt" after his death last year.
As for Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important family member," she added that her father had shown quiet pride over his success in the end.
"He was a very quiet man and not used to showing off," she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who accomplishes something, you're proud of it even if you didn't really do anything yourself.
I think he pretty much looked at Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington himself credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
By the time she landed, her daughter had been taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but to no avail.
"Nad called me regularly and told me that the situation was extremely bad, that she was not expected to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then Nad called me and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that I would have to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to sustain their heartbeats were gradually losing their effectiveness and being eliminated from the body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't floor or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who now mourned for her deceased daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew none of the difficulties she experienced.
"No one knew anything," she said.
“ My head fell and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang messages to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get assistance.
Tyler, son of Ms. Davis, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, saying that her son had been a successful chef with an infectious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, because he was "sucked down to a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, at the age of 11, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that there will be a aftermath of it."
Ms. Davis created the message “to let people know that you can go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don't sit and say nothing—you need to talk to someone."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davies for years, lost his spouse to 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't talk about him feeling bad or depressed or anything like that," she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change of temper.
He was up to his worst on Christmas Day—when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a shock to them, but that they had to work their way out of it: “This tears a hole in the family.
It's gonna tear us apart.
But we must endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a thread as the FBI has its investigation
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a study with limited time and scope - maybe we could reach a slight settlement," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "getting apart" in the midst of a disagreement between the parties where everything was in a backlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican Party supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their fiber is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, on November 6.If the Republicans are doing poorly, as expected, they seriously weaken their attempts to get their man elected to sit in the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has been calling senators to urge them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and met Ashley, his wife through him, but she was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its investigation report?
Held will be voting in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sitting.
It is not yet certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but this would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break up the tie and confirm him in the office of Chief Justice.
The number of people fleeing North Korea "remembers" under Kim
The number of people fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a Senator from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted data from the South Korean Unification Council, saying that 1127 people had fled last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter border goods between North Korea and China and higher fees were run by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not released any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to obtain South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 residents from North Korea crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest border that leads to North Korea, and is easier to cross than the well-connected neutral zone between North and South Korea.
China sees the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often forcing them to return to the homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, technically speaking, have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions mainly focused on suspended nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This was after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they roughly agreed to work together towards a nuclear-free Korean.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister blamed U.S. trade bans for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first," said Ri in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "maternally ill" and says he is ineligible to serve as a Supreme Court Justice
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader in Congress called Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge "motherly ill" and said he was too temperamental to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called hysterical," Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's ruling committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied with great emotion allegations that he had sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was extremely emotional, and sometimes ran close up shouting and got a lump in his neck when discussing his family and his school years.
He also publicly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him an "intimidation and organized reputation killing" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because he showed that he is biased towards the Democrats.
"I think these claims and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is ineligible for the job," she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired if he is confirmed and if the Democrats gain a majority in Congress.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling the Senate or the FBI the truth, he's not only ineligible to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the Washington, D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Health Affordable Care Act or the abortion law Roe v. Wade, in which he is considered to be a Conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh turned away from questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is no time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say 'much is it wonderful.'" said Pelosi.
And women need to take advantage of that.
This is a just saying, months and years of fury flows out, and it does not come from without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon, but you?"
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had developed a technique so when she got angry and started crying, she said to her manager,“ You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible to express anger in part because they are misunderstood in principle.
One of my clearest memories from a previous job I held in an office with men in the majority, where I began to cry out with fury I couldn't express, came an older woman and took me in the back of my head, she was a cold boss who I had always feared a little and she dragged me into a stairway.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and glad you've reached in on you."
Patricia Schroeder had served with Gary Hart when he was running for president, then a Democratic Senator from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught glowing at adultery aboard a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspil) and withdrew his bid, Ms. Schroeder felt, full of resentment, that there was no reason why she could not consider running for president herself.
‘It wasn't a well thought out decision,' she said laughing at me, 30 years later.
“ There were seven other candidates already, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone gave this the name 'Mill White and the Seven Dwarfs.'
With a long run on the campaign trail, she was behind in terms of fundraising, so she vowed not to run unless she managed to collect $2 million.
It was a lost struggle.
She found that some of her supporters who donated $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
‘Do they think I get a discount?' she wondered.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not formally present herself, she was so overtaken by feelings—a gratitude to the people who had supported her, a resentment towards the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and focus her eyes on voters instead of representatives, and angered by the gender discrimination—that she burst into tears.
"You'd think I'd had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder said as she recalls how the media responded.
“ You might think that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my tombstone?
'She cried?'
The reasons why a trade war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the United States and China were arbitrarily, and although the war is far from over, a gulf between the countries could be advantageous for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China's major export products, including solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
The highest level amplification came this week with new tolls covering goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), and taxing as good as half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Peking has retaliated each time and recently placed 5 to 10 percent tolls on U.S. products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to respond to the U.S. Customs Reform, and it is unlikely that another of the largest economies in the world will give in.
To get Washington to hop, demands must be given in, but it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China to publicly submit to the United States.
Experts still say that if Beijing holds the cards properly, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive effect on China in the long run, reducing the mutual need of both economies for each other.
"The fact that a hasty political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to conditions leading to economic downturns in either country, is actually much more dangerous than the audience has previously admitted," said Abigail Grace, an investigator whose focus is mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for refugees to return to the country willing and seeks help to rebuild the country, which is now in bad condition after seven years of long war.
Walid al Moualem, the foreign minister spoke at the UN General Assembly, saying that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the success in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to establish normal conditions by building areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return willing to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic decisions aimed against their daily lives and employment.
The U.N. estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need aid.
Al-Moualem said that Syrian authorities would like to accept assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept assistance dependent on conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 points on the Le Golf National field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe retook the throne when the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had difficulty most of the entire race, hit his starting hit into the water on the 16th hole, which is par 3, and lost his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games, becoming 1 of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the competition started using its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, who was at the bottom of the players' ranking in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is in the top spot on the list of the world's best golfers, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter of England who possibly played in his last match for the Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times about the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European in the competition with 25.5 career points.
“ In general, I don’t cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas to have chosen me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the trophy back.
This is about the team, and it was a pleasure to be able to help," said sentimental Garcia after Europe's victory.
He hands his lands the John Rahm torch, but he defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I was incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods.I grew up watching him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now listed with 13–21-3 in competitions for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange result for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only second behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled throughout the weekend to find themselves on the field, apart from Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the competition.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after disappointment with his team's performance, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
It was for some time that morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'll take off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA in the US and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their captain.
You have to take off.
They played better than we did."
