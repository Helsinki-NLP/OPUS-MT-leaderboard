Crying for the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone off well, and shouts and calls out in the wild are starting to pull people around the world.
‘You own the collage, I need Iceland,' says one woman out in the big world in remarks to an advertisement from the marketing campaign Look Like You Need Iceland on the content band YouTube.
Another observer says goodbye will keep Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she must get to Iceland as soon as possible, since her fiancé lives there.
On the other hand, she is unhappy in the United States, so she expects to have to wait some months yet.
Yet another observer asks if the walkway to Iceland is good, because none are the planes.
Whether he comes from another time zone does not follow the story.
Eric Thordarson of the advertising agency Peel, who came to make the advertisements along with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the reception has been hoped for again.
"I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well but this new campaign is already beating the record.
Basically, it's about creating PR values, it's getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's been amazingly successful.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in some seven hundred media outlets worldwide, which total over two billion people.
The value of that coverage is priced at $1.8 billion.
It's not unpleasant."
The main market all the same is the United States and the campaign has gone very well there, although the Americans are not on their way to the country for prey.
According to Egil, well-known market areas such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also welcomed, one Russia, which is pleasantly surprising.
Then there were reactions from exotic areas, such as India, that were not specifically laid out with.
‘These ads have toured more widely than we expected,' says Eric, whose content may have been watched by over four million people on YouTube.
‘We couldn't have wished for a better start.'
The photos here at the opening took the Year of Sæberg, the morning photographer, on the take of advertisements bearing the epilogue "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The peaks took place far and wide, such as on the School Guard Trail in Reykjavík, in Reykjavík, at Forest Falls, on the Solheim, and in a cave at Cape Reykjavík.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Paul Olafsson at Scots Productions and the cameraman of Fear Godson.
The roles provided were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Islanders came to the making of the advertisements, but at the same time recording took place in the South, there was another group in the West and West.
According to Egil, "Let It Out" is only the first segment of the Look Like You Need Iceland campaign, while a winter campaign is targeted in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for an Iceland office," Eric says, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone extremely well.
“ It’s great to work with them.
In these types of projects it's important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we're talking to."
Explosive Sands: Discussing the situation in the labor market, pension funds, and much more
Asmund Einar Dadason, Minister for Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, attends Explosives, which begins at 10 p.m. at the Wave today.
He is also Minister of Labour, discussing the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and the move of jobs out to a country that has gone bad and been controversial over the past few years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of VR, also attends the show, but he will discuss his criticism regarding investments of pension funds and lays out ideas that labor movement and professionals withdraw from the boards of funds to reduce the risk of conflict of interest.
Then, Ivar Ingimarsson, a tourist in the East, and Árnheiddóttir, CEO of the Northern Territory Market Office, will be discussed about the situation in tourism in the countryside.
They will look into the fall and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading omen of what should come.
The show can be listened to below, but it starts at 10:00 p.m.
This is what she looks like today 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in youth programs of any kind.
However, world fame earned her for her acting as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
Then she also performed in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has been carried on it lately, however, she was moved to look over the way and comment on Clueless on Australian television in the days.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
“ I have to admit that I built the character mostly on girls I met at a school that wasn’t nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said of his play in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after a night's stay
About fifty cases came on the board of police in the capital area today, saying in the police diary that the cases were diverse.
The day at the neighborhood police station began with police having to interfere with a man who had just been released from a prison cell after staying there due to drunk driving.
The man did not want to go away after his release and did not obey orders from police who told him to leave.
The man earned a continued stay at the police station because of his conduct.
Then a man was arrested in the morning wound suspected of burglary in a company in Copavogi.
Police also had to interfere with two men in Broadhole due to reports of assault.
Then, too, a woman sitting at a shopping mall in Copavogi was unable to pay for the account at the end of a meal, so she was called to the police.
A stealth car was also reported in downtown this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van searched her off for a moment, and she was then taken unfree.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Joy Corps - The Terrible Destiny of the Gleestars
The theory has caught flight on the Internet that a curse rests over the series about the Joy Squad, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days, thus becoming the third protagonist of the show to die a long way prematurely.
The Glee is a popular series about singing, dancing, and joy.
These were about the so-called youth joy squad in high school, their affections and their fate.
It was not always taken out with the bliss of being in the joy squad, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the show seemed to overcome whatever circumstances arose in their lives.
However, outside the set, major disasters have swept over the actors and employees of the show, so much so that theories have woken up that a curse rests on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santhana Lopez in the episode, a cheerleader who didn't call everything her grandmother.
After the series had run its course, Rivera took possession of actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to file a lawsuit and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was announced that Riveru was missing after her four-year-old son was found driving alone in a boat on the lake Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found asleep in a life jacket aboard the boat and he was able to report to the police authorities that he and his mother had stabbed themselves and then Rivera had brought him back into the boat but never returned to it herself.
Extensive search for Rivera.
The day after a search began, the police chief in the area reported that during a search it was assumed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially ruled dead.
It is believed that she experienced a heavy tide in the water and used her last demand to save the son.
The cause of death was recorded drowned by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American footballer with the angel voice playing a key role in bringing the Joy Squad to its glory and respect.
Outside the show, however, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his colleagues on the show felt enough, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into therapy and seemed all looking to the better way.
Just two months after he finished the treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out having fun with friends.
Banamein was found to be a lethal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
There was not thought to be an act of will.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for substance use had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his colleagues, but at the instigation of his counter-actress, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue the take of the show and dedicated the entire part to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Joy Squad, or all until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles suspected of possession of child pornography.
During a house search at his home, an enormous amount of child pornography was found, and the case was soon publicly questioned.
Clearly, Salling had run out of time.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his offences.
He had four to seven years in prison, as well as the need to be on the list of sex offenders and seek treatment for child greed.
Before a judge had determined the penalty, Salling, then free on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors of the show who dropped far prematurely.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He became acute in his sleep in 2013, aged only 41.
At the show, a woman named Nancy Motes also worked.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and did not carry the beautiful story to her sister, but she accused Roberts of great manipulation and disrespect.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with major depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé in which she stated that her mother and sister, among other things, were responsible for how she was placed.
"My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing after me except the memory that it was them that caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her fellow actors bullying and overhauling at the set and having an overt stardom.
Jesse Luken made a guest appearance on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which seemed a big scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
She experienced in 2010 that unprincipled hackers got into nude photos of her and published on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the show and had an affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used violence in the relationship to her.
Flowers can be put on almost everything
This increases the development of children when they are allowed to play in a garden with their parents growing flowers and being allowed to watch them grow and flourish.
It is also endlessly possible to do with the flowers of one Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having time with the children in the park is something that's never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and of course the precious time they had with their parents.
Buying a Boat after the tenth grade
"I don't think we're many sailors who work at the country's playgrounds," says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, who does beach fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter season."
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If well fished, you can have good income, and I think it's great to be able to let go of taking student loans.
The income is also good enough for me into the winter," says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who is engaged in beach fishing this summer like the past summers.
Axel had just docked in Tálknafjörður when a journalist reached his attention late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“ The winter I was in tenth grade, I took shipyard rights for boats under 12 feet long, and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished elementary school.
I've been fishing on a beach in my boat all summers since.
I bought the boat from a friend of mine, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named it his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea, and he was very satisfied when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," Axel says, adding that he bought the boat at three million.
“ I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I had caught.
So I had the boat without debt at the end of this first summer of mine on it."
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay off in a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“ When I was a kid, I had spent all my summers fishing with him and I had been working with my dad at sea.
I also put my square money in my boat fund."
Axel is born in Isafard, from where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Copavogi since he was a boy.
“ I am allowed to hunt here in the western area because I have a law home with my grandmother in Isafard.
I studied in these areas on the west side of rowing with my dad.
I'm moving far away depending on how I feel, because this hunting area covers the whole West Coast.
Although I think it's best to be on the west, I've also hunted around the Snaefells and beyond.
I've also hunted for the south but then preferably a graylep," says Axel, who always robs one fire early in the morning and says that he sometimes talks to seagulls and sings for the sky, in the solitude for hours out on the ballerina.
“ The Internet at sea is good, so I can call, listen to radio shows and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be on my own.
Of course I try to avoid getting into danger, but certainly occasionally something has been wrong with the weather, but never much danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the day of work depends on how the hunt works each time.
‘In the coastal fishing, I'm never more than 14 hours fishing at once, but I've also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I've been continuously for a day and a half fishing at sea.'
The arrangement for coastal fishing says he is so that he may catch 770 kilograms a day, which he feels is inhibitory.
“ Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to hunt Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I am allowed to hunt only twelve days a month, these four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days depending on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary press is to be calmed instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and able to choose according to their own heads.
So could the territorial division go because of me, too, and sea spaces that are well located at fisheries should be allowed to enjoy it," says Axel, who mostly draws cod from salts of the sea during his coastal fishing, but also only ufs and occasional other types of rivers with.
Axel works during the winter season with the university program at Nupi kindergarten in Copavogi.
"I don't think we're many sailors who work at the country's kindergartens," Axel proudly says, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the nursery.
“ I got stuck there because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that the psychology program will benefit me at the kindergarten level in the future," says Axel, who has also advanced his studies in business.
Registration error prevented return port
An error in a registration paper that people fill out when they arrive in the country caused an individual, living in this country, to not be called back for sampling.
A pedagogical number is not required if the person fills the form in English, as is the case when it is made in Icelandic.
‘This will be examined this week,' says a specialist in the National Medical Center's Center for Disease Control.
Three domestic infections were detected in the virology department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of those who tested positive came to the country on 15 July, two days after rules for the so-called return mystery came into effect.
Those living in Iceland are then screened on arrival in the country and again announced in a screening four to five days later.
However, it was stated in the ROV's lunch news that the person had acted on the old system.
The sampling on the border was negative and he was not called back to screening for the virus.
According to Kamilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, a specialist in the medical quarantine field, in a conversation with a news agency, this is attributed to an error in the electronic registration paper.
If people fill out the registration form in English, it is not a requirement to insert an identification number, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
Because it was primarily thought of as foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person has not received an automatic invitation to a sample.
However, Kamilla says many people have followed up on rules of return transmission, although they have filled the filing form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to send people into sampling again after they arrived in the country.
"This will be considered this week how people can be facilitated by the availability of this to bring their attention to the process."
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been quarantined.
They all go on sampling, but two were starting to show symptoms.
Infectious infection is currently ongoing at the three infections identified yesterday, which are largely over due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing of Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there is a variation of the coronal virus that has not been found here before.
In the second instance, the ties have focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be available tomorrow from where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation according to the COVID. is website.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been detected in this country in the past few days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and are not to form the source of the infection that emerged at the Rey Cup sports event yesterday.
Smitrakning is still ongoing.
Originally, in the third dozen exceptionally were sent to quarantine, but these were reduced to sixteen.
Overall, there are 34 quarantines due to these new infections identified yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that infection is detected at a sporting event and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
John K. Johansson, director of communications at the Public Safety Division of the Rice Commissioner, says it is well slow, as long as people follow criteria and rules.
“ We are constantly trying to help all those who live here to maintain an individualized protection.
We also need to clarify to people who are holding events that there are certain rules going on that need to be followed.
Then events can be held," says John.
He says that infection can be prevented by upholding individual infectious protections.
In addition, rules and criteria are under constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Safety and the National Medical Service are constantly sharpening people, is to consider these individual infectious protections.
Not only at home but also at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from going forward," says John.
"We need to encourage people to continue on the good road trip we were on, in order to sustain the results we have so far achieved."
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard the gang phone how difficult it was for her father to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronavirus infections.
Diabetes was specified on the death certificate as an underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same is going to happen.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not without reason.
The figures of a new study conducted by the U.S. authorities show that almost 40% of those who are deceased had diabetes 2 as the underlying disease.
When considering the proportion of people who had not reached 65 years of age, the rate increases to half.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) investigation included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of the coronavirus during the period from February until May.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC infectious disease expert, says the results are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Was the rate of slow growth Reuters had surveyed, pointing the answers from the 12 states corresponding to comparable rates.
10 states, which include California, Arizona, and Colombia, are not yet starting to report underlying diseases.
“ Synergy was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Currently, COVID—19 has broken through like a dynamic wave," has Reuters by Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American descent, who have also gone worse out of the coronavirus.
One of the best protections for people with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease under control through exercise, healthy diet, and assistance from healthcare professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to keep routine.
In this case, high prices of insulin have forced some people to continue attending work, thus risking exposure to the virus.
Reuters notes that U.S. authorities were allowed to be aware of the risks that those with diabetes 2 could be due to the virus.
As the SARS crown virus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and during the swine flu pandemic in 2009, this group was at three times the risk of having to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
According to scientist Charles S. Dela Cruz of Yale University, because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could be longer, the outbreak stripped the veil of a number of previously unknown complications.
"I fear we will see a tsunami of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton chairman of the international association of diabetics.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus outbreak may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new research directs that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then, a high proportion of glucose and lipids in diabetics can produce a true "cell signaling storm", as it is called when the immune system responds too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation which in turn can cause a fatal blood clot.
"It's all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
‘This is all connected to each other.'
The news has been corrected.
‘We were offered champagne, then they left the room'
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason faced the unusual request from artist Ragnari Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work the artist was setting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and baby mother, Ásrun Magnusdóttir, for the first time.
“ I was very fascinated by her.
It was naturally just the emission, but then I also thought it was quite inexpensively sweet.
And still feels," he says.
Åsrún also remembers this, since the husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
“ I always hear this story.
Last only this weekend," she says who also attracted the husband at first impression.
“ I felt so excited about Atla, which I like.
There are a lot of things going on and a lot of things happening and I was fascinated by it."
Attila says that he and his wife have emphasized the point in their relationship of going their own way.
“ We don’t tie our bag to the same knots as fellow travelers.
We avoid the routines we detect around us."
That is a possible reason why they took the message from Ragnari's son, the artist, just cheered, although it was mildly said to be unusual.
"Our mutual friend Kristin Anna contacts us and asks if we can come to dinner desert with him, Ragga and Ragnar's wife Ingibjörg, on Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, met the trio on Snaps, and got themselves a desert wine, and their respective desserts.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for an art exhibition he planned to set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
“ He had a multi-channel video work entitled Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Asrun states that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from everyday Western life.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating."
The scene that Ragnar asked the pair to participate in was to show a young middle-class couple making love in a minimalist room.
‘These are intercourse with the beginning and the end,' says Atli.
The couple did not know much about Ragnar, although they knew about him and he of them “but they knew us and felt that we were fit for this.
They had said that they would not advertise for people.
Perhaps they thought that they would not get the right people but people who would get sexually knowledgeable from performing for others."
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
“ When we pulled out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Aren’t we just up for this? ’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and his entire team," says Åsrun and Atli agrees.
‘This is about love and the nearness'
The scene was filmed in a fine apartment on Myrtle Street.
There was a very small-scale film team; a cameraman, Ragnar and a soundman and the pair.
After a recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Åsrún.
“ We had not decided what we should be like.
We got some instructions, but we tried to forget about time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn't played, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Åsrún.
But was it romantic?
‘Yes, it was a bit romantic,' says Atli and Åsrún agrees.
“ We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a little bit like being on vacation at a fancy hotel in Paris."
Teams were pleased with the couple's performance in the work that moved them.
‘When Tommi the cameraman watched this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful,' Atli says.
"This is as much about love as the nearness as it is about the intercourse itself," says Åsrún.
The couple's parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mom heard the voice in the son at the Museum of Art of Reykjavík and then realized that he was part of the work.
‘Then she turns around and starts to think about this,' says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that way, but then my dad just sends me a message and says, "It's nice to run into the little family in the Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.
And would the participation in the work have deepened the relationship between Åsrún and Atla?
“ At least we're still together, so maybe it deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with the in-laws," says Åsrún and laughs.
Astru himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleagues.
"I found it a bit difficult not to be with you but with someone else," she says and turns to the husband.
“ But it was fun to see this because it's just one scene in a much bigger job, and when you saw this with the other works, it's really cool.
I was able to break away from this a little bit, and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Åsrun who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scene was filmed.
‘It was just beautiful.'
Anna Marsibil Clausen interviewed Ásrúna and Atla in Love Stories on Channel 1.
Swansea with a win in the previous playoff game
Swansea earned 1—0 victory over Brentford in a dramatic match.
This was the teams' previous game in the playoff round of getting up to the English Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The position at half time was 0–0.
The locals in Swansea got a hell in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew failed the bow art of the penalty point and had the defense dismissed.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, got the red card.
Brentford therefore played the rest of the game a man fewer, and in the 82nd minute, Swansea's players took advantage of the team difference.
Andre Ayew then made up the scrimmage by scoring a great goal, securing Swansea a 1–0 win.
Thus, Swansea lead 1–0 in the final, but the second match takes place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
Ambassadorless for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland, is in the media casting light after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, appointing ambassadors in this country has not gone without difficulty for the President of the United States.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the post of Ambassador to the United States at the end of April 2009, there has been a total number of ambassadors in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst left office under distinctive circumstances, but Spotlight reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falcon Medal.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the Oval Office that she would not be honoured with the word.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
This is due in some ways to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador but then cancelled.
At last, the job took Lois Ariega had served in the foreign ministry for decades.
He then left his post in the fall of 2013 and took up the post of Ambassador to Guatemala.
Then accepted another ambassadorless period.
Robert Barber received U.S. Senate approval in January 2015 and came into service shortly thereafter, by which time no ambassador had been on the spot for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not a diplomat, but had served as attorney general and supported Barack Obama's campaign fund.
He left his post as soon as Donald Trump assumed the presidency, January 20, 2017, as usual with a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the Washington administration system.
Therefore, it took two years for the United States Congress to announce Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him the spates from and confirm at the end of his tenure as ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony in parliament, he said he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his deceased wife had been of Dutch rock broken.
Gunter is politically appointed, was formerly a California dermatologist, and has been prominent in the Jewish Republican Party organization, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded that organization, while Adelson is an avid supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, by which time there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest as an example here.
The reason is both how long Trump's administration was to nominate people in key office as well as that in recent years, U.S. Congress work has been greatly delayed, including affirming ambassadors in office.
Thus, since 2009, the total has been ambassadorless in Iceland for over five years.
However, it has not prevented operations by the embassy, which recently opened headquarters at Engatteig.
The operations are estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion, but nut-proof security walls surround the building, and bullet-proof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security because he is said to be afraid for his life and has wished to receive an armed bodyguard.
Former IBV player suffered racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former IBV player, says he experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is evident in an interview with Tonny, which appeared on the Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team playing in Uganda's top division.
During the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, including his time in this country, while he played with ÍBV, Val and Þróði in Iceland.
“ When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play at the center as I used to play.
The captain of the team was in that position but in addition, he also had the jersey number I wanted to have so I didn't get either of what I wanted," says Tonny but he played on the right side of the season with IBV.
Among the topics discussed by Tonny is racism, which he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem many black players experience when they play in Europe.
“ This once happened to me, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I learned about the case, and then I asked a friend what the matter was about.
He then told me that my opponent dropped racist remarks about me after I tackled him."
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he claims to have made the mistakes he regrets most.
Tonny had failed to get himself into the starting line-up at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get on the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he then joined Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had stayed in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted to get," says Tonny but he hoped that if he were to play well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has done away with his dreams of getting into a major European team.
Found a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-inch-long black worm in the tonsil of a woman who searched there.
The doctors were able to pull out the worm with tweets.
A study found that there was a parasite.
CNN reports.
The woman had several days before eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman improved quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi veered over in the West, the number of cases involving parasites has increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now focused on concerns about the second wave of the European coronavirus, where governments have taken measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona, where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have taken action at the same time because of the increase in the number of infections in Spain, but in the United Kingdom all have to be quarantined on their return from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned of travel to Spain.
Smitum is also repopulating in France and Germany, where governments try to find a balance to curb the spread of the virus and restore the economy.
The situation in Europe, however, is good compared to the rest of the world, but the incidence of globally infected approaches 300 thousand per day, the most considered infection in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infection has grown to 16 million globally, according to Johns Hopkins University's count, and deaths confirmed to be related to the virus have grown to 644 thousand.
A Mosaic Work of a Made Will Finally Be Enjoyed
In front of the Toll House in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men wearing orange helmets.
There is also a large grave.
And more smaller work machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the pavement is capable, and there many people now pause and contemplate works of art made of millions of mosaic tiles — as if they never saw it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least do not consider it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it there were parking spaces that were always besieged.
People parked there, locked the car in a fast-paced position, and then jumped off to do their business in the city center.
The "lively and diverse public spaces" and the "attractive urban boom" are guides to the now-defunct refurbishment of the Trygga Street.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic work of the Made Saint's Daughter at the Customs House to have a better vision.
In front of the work, there will be a square, and since the area lies well at the sun, it is considered suitable as a residence area for passersby.
The artwork will be illuminated and the fabric will now be allowed to enjoy better than before on these 142 square feet surfaces.
In the area, there will also be small "dark sprayers", some form of water sculpture, which offers play and provides the area with a certain mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by Reykjavík City, which is currently performing together with Veitum.
The docks of water, heating, and electrical power will be renewed.
Many of these have come to their years, but the sewage and cold water basins date back to 1925, having served residents and businesses in the town centre for almost a century.
Once the street is reopened at the end of the project, cars can drive through it again.
However, it becomes a one-way street and at the same time creates a quieter and more accessible space for pedestrians.
A report on the Customs House on the Customs Commissioner's site states that the house was used in 1971, its architect being Gísli Halldorsson.
Because a port ruin reached through the house, there formed a 250-square-foot windowless wall surface to the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such a surface would adversely affect the overall streetscape, if special measures were not taken to adorn the appearance of the house.
So the parties agreed to reckon by having a permanent work of art installed there.
During this time, a great deal of word of the Making of the Daughter of Saints, an artist, went on to say in the compilation.
She had worked extensively on mosaic art works in Germany and elsewhere.
The plot was to contact her first before deciding whether to compete for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work needed to mirror life at the port, since the port had been a lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was made.
When discussed with the artist, she became intrigued by such a work.
It became agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country again, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Made was given the time she decided for herself that it would be necessary, and when she returned home she made several suggestions for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the job.
At the same time, it was requested to make a complete deal with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerdr had worked with them for a long time to install famous works of art in many parts of Europe.
Negotiations took place and Gerd worked the artwork under the installation of their brothers' workshop, which then provided the installation of the Customs House.
The whole work was exceptionally well-resolutiond, both on the part of the Making of the Daughter of Saints and the Oidtmann brothers, says the summary.
Ever since then, it has resisted the unblame of Icelandic weather.
It took about two years for Gerdi to do the work, which was done and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Toll Housework was completed, aged only 47.
Prepares to move more agencies out to the country
Asmund Einar Dadason, the Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be exported to the country in the near future.
This was said by a minister in the episode Explosive at the Wave at lunchtime.
Recently, it was announced that the Department of Housing and Human Services' fire scene will be moved north to Sheep Creek this fall.
Six firefighting experts work at the agency, none of whom intend to follow the agency north and have the National Association of Fire and Ambulance Officers criticised the residential transports.
“ I think we should take further steps into this being.
I'm preparing for further steps into this creature.
Further transport," said Asgard.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
"I think it needs to make further political decisions about the move of public jobs abroad, like I was doing with the Housing and Humanities Agency," said Ásmundur, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been exported to the country and was of great importance to communities offshore, such as the transfer of the Food Institute to Selfoss, Iceland's surveyors to Akraness and unemployment insurance in Skaga Beach.
All the main things from the second day of Championships
The 94th Icelandic Volunteer Championships ended at Thorsveil in today's Akurey.
Several tournament records were set on the second race day.
An exciting competition was calculated in the women's slalom at Thorsveil, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set an Iceland record in a slalom throw in 2014, which lasted until Elizabeth Rut Rúnarsdóttir from the IR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Iceland record back earlier this summer and has been in fantasy form lately, but she has tripled the Iceland record for the rest of the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injuries and did not recover today.
She had only one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 yards, which is far from her best.
Vigdis threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 metres in her last attempt, and at the same time set a tournament record.
Her Island record she set earlier in July is 62.69 metres, so she was a bit from it.
Gudrun Karitas Hallgrimsdóttir from the IR had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best result with a throw of 50.18 metres.
In the men's category, FH pitcher Hilmar Örn Jónsson, an Iceland record-holder in strikeouts, won safely, but he threw 73.84 yards in his next pitch, setting a tournament record.
His Island record in the article is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympic and Iceland record holder in a round-robin, won a race in a ball event at Thorsvell yesterday, but today he competed in a round-robin event which is his main event.
The Island record of Guðna Vals is 65.53 metres, but he threw the longest 59.13 metres today, securing the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today, but he had one valid throw that was enough for the 2nd, 49.43 metres.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, an Iceland record holder in the long jump, won the long jump race by an advantage, while Hafdís jumped the longest 6.25 metres today which is less than 40 cm from her Iceland record.
In the women's 200 metre race, it was the IR-man Guðbjörf Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, but she came on goal in 24.04 seconds, while her Iceland record in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörf Jona was victorious in the Acre, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 metres race and in the 4 x 100 metres relay, and also in the 4 x 400 metres relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður was out of FH first in goal in the 200-metre race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mona Samuelsson of the Year.
Like Guðbjörf Jona, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres race.
Won't get fine for $27 million Bitcoin crop
The Superintendent Tax Commission has rejected the claim of a tax auditor who demanded a fine over a man for under-representing his capital gains that were due to the sale of the electric coin Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that a tax investigation director would not have provided clear evidence for why it would be necessary to fine the man.
The committee's ruling states that the tax investigation director believed the man had places understood on materially incorrect tax returns due to the income years of 2016 and 2017.
He would have understated his capital gains which would be due to the sale of the electric coin Bitcoin of $27 million, either intentionally or out of spectacular carelessness.
The man should be fined for his conduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, he went on to sell an electric coin in 2016 for $27 million.
It would have been acquired by diggers in 2009 and 2010 when such would have been both easy and undoored with a normal home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electrical coins, taxation due to such sales had been substantially unclear and unforeseeable.
It would have been almost possible to expect citizens to recognize such measures on tax returns.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax from the crop and would have accounted for his possession of the advocacy as a deposit on a cash account.
He would have questioned both the faculty and the state tax manager about how this was done but to no avail.
Then he believed that he had to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
So he would have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that tax authorities would not have formed a clear opinion of.
Thus, the man felt it was correct that his taxes for those two years of income would be redefined and stress applied but otherwise not a form of punishment.
Then he reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in this country since 2012.
He would never have intended to get out of his duties in an indecent way.
The requirement for a fine would be out of control and would plunge him into debt.
Armor raises publicity: "This man understands what football is about"
Andersen Willumsson's armor has been considerably between the teeth on people but also impressed by his passing for the remainder of the season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max League.
Bliks will be in the fire line tonight when they welcome IA live on Station 2 Sport.
Armor then takes out a game ban due to four reminders in the season, so he does not show up for play with a new haircut as in the summer games so far.
He had had a "blah, blah, blah" written on his head before the match with HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“ I don’t know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but talking about character, this one was more of a try in the game.
He didn't go into hiding.
He wants the ball every time, and if there was anyone going to level this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Guðmundur Benedictsson in the Pepsi Max stand, when it was believed that Brynjolfur.
‘I'm supposed to be here for the people.'
“ It is difficult at times to figure out what position he is in.
He seeks out a little bit on the left as it starts to pass to the games, but he has a very free ruckus on the team," said Hjörvar Hafjarðarson.
Thorkell Máni Petersson tells Brynjolf a real entertainer and rejoices to get such a colorful man in the department: “No one disputes that it is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to always be ready to show up and answer in interviews.
There's an amazing lot of people busy with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is about.
“ I am an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the Brynjalf interviews, people are paying their way in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Moon.
Player KR says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in touch with some teams in the B-team"
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in the Pepsi Max League, appears to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish medium Bold, Tobias is ready to go back home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to reach the start of the season in his home country, but to do so he first has to resign his contract at KR, where the Danish league starts before that Icelandic odds.
The company knows I miss Denmark and have shown me a lot of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“ I have been in contact with several B-team teams and will probably switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There aren't many teams in Denmark that can allow themselves to pay up my contract at KR."
He then says that he likely needs to take on a pay cut in Denmark.
"Families in Denmark probably felt more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland."
Wheelcy whisperer Brightmar has recovered bikes for millions - Responds now for himself after DV coverage
For over a year, Brightmar Leosson has had interests unlike most others.
He sniffs and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric wheels and wasps.
As a result, Brightmar has earned the name "the bike whisperer".
Yesterday, when one published an account of his dealings with Brightmar, there was such a stir.
Consider DV them in a discussion on the Facebook group of Western towns, stating that Brightmar took the man to speak in the East and said the wasp may be stolen.
There was no other way to read from the original writings of the electric shuttleman than that Brightmar was a thief.
That text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of DV's original news update accordingly.
Brightmar reports initial reports of the case at all not illustrating what really went on yesterday in the East.
Brightmar said he received information from an electric shuttle victim that these were truly his electric shuttles.
That information was given to the alleged owner from others, but the information turned out to be incorrect says Brightmar.
“ I saw the guy, and I knew the shuttle, since there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and was searched for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him getting ready to drive off on the shuttle, I decided to punch in to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I get very fine on a case like this, but before I was able to finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word off me."
Brightmar says that the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the wheel and himself called police.
"Yes, cool," Brightmar said, "let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
Later, the right owner of the electric shuttle reported his story on Facebook, as reported in an earlier report.
During this over a year that Brightmar has pursued this practice, he says he can count the exchanges he got up against people on the fingers of one hand.
"I have had peaceful relations with the hardest men in Reykjavík," said Brightmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the least of the least brothers and sisters in the community, addicts, mentally dressed people and other people who are on the street for some reason.
"The addiction is a tough master and somehow the next dose has to be financed, unfortunately the theft of such loose money is an easy way to that goal," says Brightmar.
“ My relationships with these people are really so good that I am joined by many of the good people.
There are instances of people taking treatment and taking turns and then looking to me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Brightmar's interaction with bicycle people is on a polite note.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, stell numbers of wheels, and so on.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has been dealt with little.
Furthermore, Brightmar says the police are even starting to point out to people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Brightmar disagrees with DV's previous newscast, saying he is not a single self-imposed police officer in a personal search for justice.
When asked if he has not yet arrived on the slippery ice with his act, and whether this is not primarily the role of police, Brightmar says so certainly is.
“ Of course the cops are supposed to do this, but the fact is that the cops are simply not doing this.
I have to figure out the police officers are driving away from a huge pile of stolen wheels.
She's frankly powerless on these issues."
‘When the cops aren't doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this case, then why not?' asks Brightmar.
He claims to have had so much success in tracking down stolen wheels, that sometimes he comes across his "shadows" on the street that then they just got the right Brighter wheels they had previously recovered from.
The times Brightmar has called for police help have happened to simply not be there.
"This just isn't working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the owners of the bicycles' fault," Brightmar said and is sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer the emptiness of police in this class of cases.
On Brightmar's success is not disputed.
In many places, stories of people can be found thanking Brightmari for having regained his possessions to them.
Brightmar himself says he has long lost the number on the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amount probably runs at millions, if not millions.
Roads there power vests, electric wheels, and electric shuttles heavy, but electric wheels can cost up to half a million.
Brightmar works day-to-day in kindergarten, and every other weekend he works in a commune.
His bicycle quest is therefore unpaid work he does in his spare time.
Pensions and Long Shadows
In 2019, there was a large anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
True, officials had received pensions from the Danish king all the streets from the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund of officials was established which eventually became the pension fund of all public servants.
The basis for the current pension funds of general wage earners was then laid by universal labor contracts in 1969, which provided employment-related pension funds with compulsory membership and a valid fund collection since the beginning of 1970.
Then, in 1974, a law was passed on the basis of these contracts, and the pension system continued to intensify thereafter.
The pension system of wage earners was not the only radical change that the 20th century labor movement pushed forward with its collective struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been similarly obtained during historic strike conflicts in 1955, and the organization was also gradually given its requirements for sick justice and medical funds, significant holiday rights, reduced working hours, housing reform, and more importantly.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle but proved to be, in retrospect, far greater and more permanent core compensation than the increase in the number of cents in the pay envelope, which disappeared as hard in the heat of inflation that marked the post-war period and up to 1990 as many remember.
The advocacy of the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although men eventually agreed that the funds would, in effect, become the property of fund partners, the labor movement had to agree that their governments were to be appointed representatives of the professional and fund partners to be equal.
In the years that followed the founding of the funds, the requirement for the majority of workers in the board of funds often came to be discussed in the Association of Employees, yet it never succeeded, so we still sit up with the unnatural arrangement that representatives of fund partners are not in the majority of the fund boards.
Article 36 of Law No. 129/1997 on compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds discusses the investment policy of the funds.
It states in the 1st paragraph that "a pension fund shall be guided by the interests of a fund partner."
Also states in the 5th, "A pension fund shall set moral criteria for investments."
The stockholder policy of the Traders Pensions Fund includes the following provisions, followed by the aforementioned statute:
The pension fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules for responsible investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the west and in Europe.
The rules discuss how a focus on environmental and social issues as well as good governance by companies can contribute to improved investment success of stock collections.
In this way, the interests of investors and the goals of society go together in a broader context.
The LV believes it is important that associations, especially those registered in the stock market, set a public policy about: to have good governance practices of social responsibility and the environment.
The Pensions Value, which has the largest funds in the country, has set a "trade for responsible investments", and there are provisions of similar nature.
This is all remembered here as an introduction to Icelandic's latest fashion word, "shadow management".
Since the word is new in the case, it is not hope that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me the following definition is now 'most taken': Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he is going to send representatives of the society to the board of pension fund recommendations or instructions on how to take a stand on a particular issue.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the first convenient time.
If the leader doesn't take this to the media and doesn't talk about resignation, however, it's not 'shadow management' since, of course, there are such interactions between humans all the time in the financial world as anywhere else.
I leave it to the reader to reflect on which path he finds 'shadower.'
There are particularly two people who have tried to coin this definition when this is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
It is they are a Hard Ægisson journalist on the Newspaper and Ásgeir Jónsson's banker.
The occasion for both came about after Bogi Nils Bogason, president of Icelandair, told of his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (telling them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Trade Union then sent out the recommendations to the company's representatives in the Board of Pensions of Traders not to support the fund's possible purchase of shares in the company, or they might be let go.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, followed by Ragnar Thor's same route with his recommendations, which were, of course, central to Boga's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw Hard and Ásgeir's reason to diversify on the issue in Friday's Newspaper with big words about shadow management, legal violations, and a rich need for changes in the law.
It certainly had a small dowry to roll a heavy load, although the blessed dome had been in a subjunctive manner and also was quickly wiped out.
Since the matter is important, consider the matter itself at the end.
I here tracked ahead the elements of the Life Funds Act that are subject to this issue.
These include that fund governments should safeguard the interests of fund partners and have moral criteria in investments, and these points are elaborated in the approvals of both Value and Pensions of Traders as I mentioned.
However, pension funds are NOT to look solely at short-term economic considerations in their investments.
Such would be a very dangerous policy and need not long seek examples of such things in the past, as large deposits of banks and funds have flowed to immoral adventurers and environmental messes, with disastrous consequences.
The director of Icelandair was obviously on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out an entire group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill enjoyed by the company in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw himself and withdrew this.
Time will tell if this is enough for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered accountable to fund partners at the time.

One of the infected did not have a return mystery
One of the three identified with Covid-19 on the country yesterday arrived in the country from the Baltic state on July 15 last July, about a week and a half ago.
However, he is an Icelander who is not regularly living here, so he did not receive clear instructions to conduct a so-called return trajectory after arriving in the country and undertake another sampling a few days after arriving.
He received negatives from screening at the border.
‘But he's in Icelandic society and really supposed to take that resort,' says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, an expert in the field of quarantine at the National Medical Center and a substitute for a quarantine doctor while on summer vacation, in a conversation with Today's Newspaper.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the identification number and if the identification number is not registered then you are not automatically announced for the second sample."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad but because of his network of connections on the country that Icelander should have rather used it Icelandic.
However, he did not figure this out.
“ When the identification number is not registered, you have to seek it yourself for the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized it was the right way," says Kamilla.
“ It is thus clear that we need to advance the information on this while we find some way to automatically make a preaching system even though Icelanders do not record their identification numbers.
Or then somehow make it more obvious who are participants in Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, however, the person was associated with few on arrival in the country, although he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, a verandi Íslander.
Only six have been quarantined after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They have yet to undergo sampling, however, two of them have begun to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received negative from his sampling at the border on 15 July.
Kamilla likely says that he was it recently infected with the virus that it was not yet able to be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the man being infected here in Iceland, not carrying the virus to the country.
"It is not quite possible to claim that this is definitely an imported infection because it is a long time ago that he came to the country that he may have been exposed here like the two who have caused a little strain in connection with the athletics events."
However, that is what she says is very unlikely because of the few people around here.
‘It's really very unlikely,' says Kamilla but states that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the virus in man.
"If we get a virus type that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain he carried it to the country."
Piper spray and bombs used against protesters
A confrontation ensued between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used protesters pepper spray and non-combatant grenades, but protesters broke windows and set fire.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and racism were widely protested in the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon State.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
As stated on the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a building area and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
As a result, police said the protest was a riot, and there were clashes between groups of protesters and police.
Requires Justice In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black male who was murdered by police in August last year, was recalled by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black National Guard officers gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police at her home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched in factions to a closed intersection, where police affiliated the group from a group of people protesting the protest and also carrying firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters recalled James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Manchester United's football manager, does not want to overplay the importance of the match with Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United lose the match, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, Solskjær and his men finish in 5th place, thus missing out on Championship place.
However, they would still hope to enter the Champions League by winning the European League next month.
“ We are not yet at the terminal.
If we reach a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we now haven't had a bad season," Solskjær said.
‘But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of ground to get the two teams above us,' Solskjær said.
It is clear that the nerves of men will be there by 15 p.m., but Solskjær tried to act as if it were every other game.
"If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and on this the company is based.
We've made a great opportunity to end the season well and now it's ours to exploit it," Solskjær said.
“ It's not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our season, we have already had many times as defining this season."
"The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I believe that whole over we are in better shape and much stronger spiritually than last season," Solskjær said.
65,000 infections per solar cycle
65,490 new infections of the coronavirus were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed west since the beginning of the outbreak in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but the last four days up to that point, deaths from the virus were more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a CNN report, according to the prediction model of the U.S. quarantine authorities, the number of deaths from the virus will be 175,000 on August 15 next.
Fear another wave of the outbreak
The governments in Spain are now trying with weak power to restrain the increased spread of COVID—19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID—19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more identified in one day since the beginning of May, and the reports come at the same time as the Spanish begin to lift one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
The backlash led to the British authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to go into quarantine upon return.
A week before, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is at its worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where governments have resorted to wider restrictions in an attempt to curb the growth.
In the capital city of Barselona, entertainment facilities will be closed for the next two weeks, and waves will be made to close at midnight.
Then a curfew is now in effect for 200 thousand residents of Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is poorly played after the outbreak.
Tui, the largest travel agency in the United Kingdom, cancelled all flights planned for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to prepare for the second wave of the outbreak, but there appears to be little interest in resorting back to an extensive curfew that has broadly devastated the economy.
In order to form, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken a very bad look at such a thing and likens it to nuclear weapons he does not want to use.
Then French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," in the event of a nationwide curfew again.
Many councillors are hoping for local resources that will reach residents of individual towns, cities, or areas will be sufficient to hold back the virus in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three inland
Three domestic infections were identified yesterday as well as two more at the border.
Thus, five people with positive Covid-19 infection were identified yesterday in Iceland.
The announcement of public safety says that one of the infections is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
Has the one been sent into solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of a sports club in Reykjavík and is according to the announcement, "only part of the sports team" in quarantine.
Others who were quarantined are related to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is undetected and the full-time infectious ransacking team of state marshals.
ReyCUP convention holders have applied the guidelines and regulations of the Centers for Disease Control and Public Safety that are still in effect and have appropriate measures taken.
However, pictures of yesterday’s convention drew attention, as it was seen in very close association to celebrate the good luck of his team in the field.
Just before 11 p.m. today, the delegates published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says “ATH: Parents please respect the rules for contestants to pick up their own stuff at school.
Parents are NOT permitted to do so.
Thank you for your shown understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday, but is related to the infection reported last day.
Says in the announcement, "An Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the infection and a new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
The case is also being infected in isolation and 12 are being quarantined for the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was identified on the southwest corner of the country.
The person is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral transmission.
In addition, two people were identified at the border and are awaiting the results of further research such as a cross-border infection procedure states.
Finally, the announcement states: The Public Safety Division of the State Commissioners and the Office of the Surgeon General are encouraging people to be careful and careful about individual infectious protections.
Playing the least doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same is asked to have a demonstration at the nearest clinic.
Patrekfjord says campgrounds booked on traders weekend - Direct visitors another
The tent area on the Patriarchal is fully booked this weekend, according to the Western Front's announcement.
Visitors are told to look at other accommodation options.
Named Westside Bildudal, Tölknafjörður, Melanes on the Red Sand, Hotel Complex, and Hotel Breitavik as alternatives to the situation.
There is plenty to be on Patreksförður this weekend, because like previous years, Sköldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentary films will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007, making it a strong tradition in the town.
From an application to the campground, good attendance can be expected this year, if weather does not put a line in an account, but DV told earlier today of a defunct forecast.
However, the worst weather can be expected south, and hope for the Patriots.
The bb.is website first reported, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
An entire apartment building collapses into the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18–20.
Meanwhile, owners seek a construction permit for renovation, but their business has rolled around in the system for a third year.
In one of the oldest, most granary and most expensive neighborhoods in Reykjavík City, a grand multi-storey building stands on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of commercial space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairways, each retaining four fairly grand apartments.
They range from 93–130 square metres, though most over 100.
The house has a considerable history.
It was built in 1959 and has included a video rental, the Shoe Room, Milk Consumer's Milk Exchange, a Joa Gunsmith, a Fish Sale, and now, most recently, a College Print.
The house, to be of little use, has remembered its fief fairer.
The house now suffers severe damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 a.m.
Owners of D18 a.m. are according to the corporate register among others Magnus Magnusson and Gudrun Helga Larussdóttir.
Magnus headed the Payment Ownership Group and was the Defender of the Payment Ownership Company.
In the group of owners of the holding company Payment is Steel Ships a.k.a.
Steel Ship a.k.a. is the investment company of Goddess Saint Lazarus Daughter and her children.
At the same time, Gudrun is the owner of a third segment in the D18 a.m.
Guðrún and her husband, Augustus Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once operated the locomotive Steel Ship.
D18 a.m. bought the house in the summer of 2009, so it has been little or nothing maintained since then.
Tell neighbors that the condition of the house has steadily deteriorated since, though most recently.
On the neighborhood's Facebook page of residents, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in recent years".
It may play into the fact that owners have for several years sought to change the house and grounds.
Other neighbors say the house for a long time has not been okay.
‘It's a long time to do something decent about this spot and it's boring that it's drawn like this.'
At the same time, he says that he is outraged by the owners of the house for failing to drive himself to finish this, finding some common ground with the neighbors of the house, and stopping this 'legal clot'.
"Just do this in consultation with the surrounding community so that this can be rushed and finished."
The 'legal patch' referred to by the resident is the organizational process of the field that has been in progress at least since 2017.
The Dunhaga 18 and 20 owners were then exhumed after a warrant to build a hill on top of the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator house and one floor annex as well as a basement.
The construction permit granted for that implementation was filed with the Committee on Environment and Resources, and the committee overturned it as the implementation was not supported by a divisional structure and a nearby presentation was not adequate.
Reykjavík City then embarked on a sharing organisational work and concluded it with an advertisement in Government News in July last year.
That organization was also sued and the committee overturned it in March 2020.
Thus, at this point, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for a construction permit and the owners of the house had begun.
At that time, the house had dipped down considerably and neighbors began to tire.
When the DV questioned the neighbours of the house about the situation and the reactions of neighbours, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intention of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Others directed their anger at the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but nothing necessarily involved.
Still others said the parking lot disputed apples, but neighbours have used Dunhaga's unused 18–20 parking lot under their vehicles.
One accuser in the case said he long-suffered on the administration:
“ That we need to go through the process three times is absolutely amazing.
It's like the City of Reykjavík doesn't know how to read."
Today, the house stands empty, abandoned, and is neglected.
Monument to the city's floatases administration and noble plans of the owner and their many years of work now in the starting stage.
When a journalist was at Dunhaga 18, you broke open his doors and piles of garbage.
Playstation computer and recent television were lying around other debris on the ground — victims of an Icelandic summer blunder.
The opening was into the old office of the University Prints and there was a considerable amount of cats of the piss smell to judge.
Clearly, someone has nested around in one corner, but no one is visible.
The stacks of couches and beds and some boards of geological pages, which were no doubt to become a book, were alarmed.
The apartment building's stairways were also open and life in both of them.
A journalist was lucky enough to run into the people of one of them.
Were there Romanians boiling potato dishes for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the Ztrongforce staff rental a.k.a.
They have been there for some time and copy DV sources that the company has paid nothing for the premises except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not precarious to collect rent.
From the bulk of mail in the lobby of the house to the judging, it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers living there on the last miss.
The operation of employee rents has not gone a good part of the Covid-19 situation, as the contraction of tourism led to a recession in the construction sector, and these two schemes were what most efficiently exploiting the services of employee rents.
Nevertheless, homeowners at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do and hung the work faults and wickets in the joint venture to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist said goodbye to the boys in Romanian, the irony suddenly became clear: At the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square feet of real estate is dilapidated.
Owners want to change the house for better, and neighbors want to improve conditions but argue about the definition of 'improved'.
In between, the city's organizational area then sits on the starting line, victim of endless appeals and lawsuits in the planning process, and floats the resolution of the Committee on Environment and Resources.
In the house, there are so Romanian workers, perhaps just those who go into improving the situation, when the Islanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in the July 17 weekend issue of DV.
In a campaign against overweight following a coronavirus pandemic
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide £10 million in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his severe illness, in part due to his weight.
It is suggested that Johnson introduces the campaign, which has been promised better health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their patrons to overweight and will additionally be attacked in an effort to increase the number of bicycle trails.
Then, adverts will be banned on television by 21 p.m., according to British media sources.
"COVID—19 has raised us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become more healthy, effective, and eat a healthy diet," a government spokesperson is quoted as saying.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when he was infected with the coronavirus this spring, and it is partly his weight due to which he is believed to have fallen so seriously.
Women Better to Lead the Change
She said that the new constitution is the biggest step the nation can take toward greater distribution of power, transparency, and in countering corruption and to the interests of the whole.
“ We need to change gear a little now, and who is better off leading such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
There are women," Helga said.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their female solidarity.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
So now it's just our turn to lead these changes."
She said she was a little alarmed at the emphasis on Iceland as "best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
“ Then we are not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We must know where we are coming from and know history and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don't live with the same rules all around here," Helga said.
When asked, she said that women are in many ways in good terms in Iceland, but she added that, as in many other places, Icelanders live in extremely masculine values.
She said that politics was turning to form about her own interests, domination and power that were the forces that maintained disparity in all societies.
"Women have now formed this group and come together and have just become a little frustrated that the Assembly is going to tread in a trestle looking past this referendum since 2012," she said.
“ It is these feminine values that we are thinking about.
Based on human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were fundamental to the new constitution.
“ We are a very rich country of natural wealth, and it is absurd that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can trade differently," Helga said.
“ It is absurd that there is some natural law that women’s work is always lower.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses will have to stand up indefinitely in a collective fight just to achieve a decent wage."
The signature list of new constitutions can be signed here through electronic Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian downtown
A man was arrested downtown last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
Police also stopped the production of drugs in Årby, where two people were arrested over the case.
Then police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in the hills, where its driver was at 146 km speed with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been stripped of his driving rights.
Police in the capital area had enough spinning for the night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was then a particularly high level of noise reporting due to consistents.
Saturday night saw the announcement of eleven noisy parties, and it was widely felt in the police diary.
However, during the night, 22 noise cases rallied on the board of police.
Six were saved in a prison cell last night.
During the Town, police were called in for the night when parties launched fireworks.
However, they had escaped when police officers were in the process.
Then nine drivers were stopped for drunks and or drug driving.
Four people were arrested over a fight downtown last night, one of which was saved in a prison cell.
Then two were taken to emergency room after they fell on the face, one in the downtown area and the other in the western town.
One was taken to the emergency room after he was injured jumping on a trampoline in Copavogi.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver pulling a trailer on Kjalarnes yesterday.
The trailer's gear was, according to a police diary, in a "very bad condition" and it was static.
Can you stay at Monet's house for the shopkeepers' weekend?
The house, in which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice, is now available for rent on the Airbnb site.
The next available night in the house is around the shopkeepers' weekend.
The house is small and sweet, located in the town of Givenry, Normandie, France.
The painter of world fame lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone plans to rent the house, they must rent at least two nights.
Given Airbnb's page, it is next available in a week, on the Sunday of the traders' weekend, so it might be ideal for some shopkeepers on vacation to rush to book the painter's house.
The two nights over traders' weekends cost only $964 US dollars or just over $13,000 as the Newspaper comes next.
Dozens in quarantine and a few of them begin to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been identified with the domestic coronavirus in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens are quarantined because of this, and several of them are beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were identified with the domestic coronavirus yesterday and two at border screening.
According to an expert at the office of the surgeon general, the increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely into the community.
“ The first domestic virus has been sequenced, and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to think that it has gone undercover in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country but of course we need to be very alert now," said Kamilla Sigrid, daughter of Joseph, an expert in the quarantine field of the office of Surgeon General.
Most of them infected have been associated with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling takes place in the near future than a few, who were in association with the infected, have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now there's not an influenza going on and less about other respiratory infections so we can be quite liberal with doing these tests on individuals who in an influencous period would have felt reason to do something else first," said Kamilla.
Infectious infection is mostly complete, but it is not ruled out that more people need to be quarantined.
Two of the infected were identified after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions as to whether it is precarious to hold such events.
The Public Safety Communications Director says it is well slow as long as people follow criteria and rules.
Kamilla says it is virtually ruled out that the infected have been infected at the sports events.
“ If there is no more in isolation from these individuals after associating with them at these sports events, then we can claim that our quarantines at the conventions worked.
But it's not revealed," said Kamilla.
The Public Defense Department's workforce is under constant review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if there seems to be a reason," Kamilla said.
After over a week, there will be mass restrictions to be evacuated to a thousand people.
This new situation could affect the emergence of compromises.
'Active Meditation to Cook' - Look at Elia Wood's menu
Elisha Vidarsdóttir is an accomplished footballer and plays with Val.
She is also a master of nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day's activities and usually gives herself time to cook good and nutrient-rich foods.
My usual day starts by showing up for work out of eight," says Elisha.
‘After work, I go to the store to get ready for dinner before I pick up my girl at kindergarten at about 3 p.m.'
Elisa feels very nourished by attending her daughter early in kindergarten.
“ It’s good to spend time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After practice, it's good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to empty our minds."
Elisha does not follow any particular diet.
She is putting a final hand on a master's thesis in nutrition, so she knows well what is appropriate for her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family, and exercise.
“ What suits me is to eat a wide variety of foods well composed of proteins, carbohydrates, and fat.
However, I find it most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food into bad or good, rather nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor.
You see, it's all right to eat everything, just not all of a sudden and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I find it a matter of meditation to stand in the kitchen cooking and get it very much.
I must say that my confidence is with me in the kitchen and I deeply believe that I am a fine cook."
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, let in almond milk overnight.
Then pull this meal with what is available every time.
Most of the time it's banana and crispy musli & KAFFI.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Interlude: Incrediblely disparate, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, clean shear with banana and musli, bread with weights, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if that is the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of foody salads from what exists in the refrigerator, quinoa or barley, falafel buns, rock salad, oven-baked vegetables with good dressing is a little bit what I'm working with.
If the organization gets completely out of hand (which often happens), then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often, and then it's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled eggs, don't put more effort on you.
Interlude: Get me something carbohydrate rich for exercise, bread with a lotion, cereal, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will be very often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegan dishes.
Conflicts between police and protesters in Seattle
Municipal authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of insurgency following widespread protests in the city center.
Police yesterday seized a flare bomb and pepper spray in an attempt to clear a large area occupied by protesters, extending over many blocks in the vicinity of the city's parliament building.
Police reported on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into vandalism carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some sort of bomb.
Municipal and police authorities say protesters stoned police with rocks, bottles, bang bombs, and other casuals, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were made.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time in front.
A blow was made to them to show solidarity to protesters in Portland, Oregon, which in that city has repeatedly come into heavy conflict between protesters and heavily armed rural FBI agents.
There, like in more U.S. cities, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protests against systematic racism in American society and demands relief.
Do not cancel until after voting
It is not yet clear whether the layoffs of the Icelandair flight attendants to take effect for the next few months will be revoked.
A raw vote on the collective bargain of Iceland's Aviation Association on behalf of a flight attendant at Icelandair ends at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Liney Johansdóttir, chairman of the Society, says he is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the layoffs until the result of the vote is in place.
‘This definitely hangs together,' says Gudlaug Liney.
“ There have been no cancellations, this must begin to be available so that the machines can be humanized.
Then, of course, people are harsh after getting to know if they'll have a job after the month."
A contract signed a week ago, on the night of July 19.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a deal previously dropped by flight attendants.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Trustees of the Icelandic Aviation Association agreed to announce an all-military stoppage at Icelandair, members of the community agreed to do so in a vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided in the wake of Icelandair's decision to cease talks with the Flight Attendance Society, resign all of her flight attendants, and seek contracts with another union.
The airline's pilots were then to take on the duties of safety personnel on board temporarily.
Ask how she believes the vote will go, says Gudlaug Liney is hard to tell.
“ People are in pain after Icelandair's visit, when all the airline's flight attendants were dismissed and reported to be signed with another union.
It is now revealed if it has an effect," she says.
940 flight attendants were employed by Icelandair at the end of April, when 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their deadline of resignation is varying in length, with those with the shortest careers being three months and thus ending by the month of July-August.
There are about 90% of Icelandair's flight attendants in that group.
What will the agreement not accept?
“ Then we would like to continue our discussions with our guests.
With this deal, we are meeting Icelandair's demands.
If he is rejected, it is clear that flight attendants feel that they have been overstepped."
A vote on a collective bargain ends, and Icelandair presents the settlement of the second quarter tomorrow
The flight attendant's vote for a new collective bargain ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's settlement for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary run results indicate that the company's revenue has dropped 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electronic vote on the collective bargain between the Icelandic Aviation Federation and the Association for Employment for Icelandair began on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday, 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who may vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay social fees to the Flight Attendance Society.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new collective bargain on the night of Sunday 19 July, but Friday before, Icelandair had terminated talks with the company after flight attendants coalesced the previous contract in a vote in early July.
At that time, Icelandair had told all the airline's flight attendants and flight crews on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective agreement was signed.
Under a new collective bargain, flight attendants must fly five hours more a month for the same basic pay.
The core agreement applies until 2025, whereby the provisions of pilots and flight attendants have been integrated for how long to fly on a single shift.
The agreement was presented to FFI members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and declared many flight attendants with whom a news agency discussed them over dissatisfaction over the deal.
However, most seemed to agree that the deal had to be approved to keep the FFI alive.
Icelandair's settlement for the second quarter will be introduced tomorrow, but the company's EBIT, its operating output for capital teams and taxes, is according to preliminary operating results negatively about $100 million to $110 million US dollars or about $15 billion.
Icelandair sent the Chamber of Commerce preliminary calculations last Wednesday, which stated that the company's revenues amounted to about $60 million in the quarter or about $8.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, around $21 billion was the equivalent and the equivalent of about $154 million.
At the same time, Icelandair aims to offer the company's shares in August.
Icelandair aims to complete contracts with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of a month before going into equity tender.
New variant rather than new type of virus
“ A new virus simply means that it has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been grinding in this country," says Már Kristjánsson, chief medical officer at the National Hospital's Infectious Diseases Department, about the reports that a "new type of virus" has been identified in this country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One person diagnosed had been involved in the social work of a sports club during the Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection was undetected and infectious.
An infection was also detected by a person who arrived on 15 July and there are two people who were in contact with him beginning to show symptoms of COVID—19.
Then, an infection was detected yesterday associated with an infection that was reported last day and after sequencing by Icelandic genetic analysis, a "new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
Infection is completed in conjunction with that infection.
Már notes that it is not a new virus but it is the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. the new crown virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and if it could say something about the start of another wave of outbreaks, Moor says that there is currently a single case and it could go so that there will be nothing more.
‘But if it goes, there are cases of domestic non-relationships from abroad and has the same genotype as this particular variant, then that conclusion [of the second wave] could be drawn but it is premature at present,' explains Moor.
Oh, my goodness in the hot tub
Is the secret to the happiness of Icelanders hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC's programmakers lead to the similarity in a fun video that sheds light on the country's swimming pool and hotspot culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is special globally, and it is claimed that nowhere in the world are as many people bathed per capita.
The natural geothermal is its foundation, but also the tradition of swimming practice that prevails here.
Children's swimming education was legalized in 1940, but senior citizens are no less diligent in making use of the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as a permanent part of the country's general welfare.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
Free of cell phones, people discuss in personal notes about worlds and space or enjoy the palliative power of water: meditation and charging the batteries of soul and body.
On the steeply picking up a hundred days of elections
One hundred days is until the Americans go to election and choose a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he is to pick up the steeple.
Joe Biden, the future Democratic Party candidate, has a large advantage over Trump nationally, is central to the polls.
According to a new survey by the AP News Agency, the record number of Americans believes that the nation is on the wrong track.
Similarly, Trump's response to the new coronavirus pandemic is very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans than before believe that the president has held the economy badly.
More specifically, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the outbreak, and 48 percent say he kept the economy well.
In March it was a percentage of 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden's follow-up is 49.9 percent nationwide, while Trump follows 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift his attention away from his performance towards the epidemic to Biden, promoting so-called cultural disputes, and proclaiming policies to be subject to law and order.
Biden's offer, however, puts a lot of effort into keeping Trump's focus on, believing a high chance of winning if the election is really about how Trump has done his job in the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity also seems to be going to bring down the Republican Party delegates, fearing the Framers that the Democrats could even gain a majority in the U.S. Senate, which has so far felt very high.
Politico reported in the days to remain a party and candidate comparable to what it is now, the Republican Party would receive its greatest accreditation for decades.
The suburb has proved particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary election, and there is now an appearance that that development will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate suburban residents into following him, including saying that becoming President of Biden, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and promote racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has dropped regulation from Barack Obama's time in the White House designed to increase suburban diversity.
Then he urged the "housewives" of the suburbs of the United States to read an article by former Lieutenant Governor of New York, arguing that Biden would destroy the suburbs of the United States and undertook Trump.
“ Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!" said the President.
Residents of the suburbs of the United States are an increasingly expanding group of voters.
According to NPR, they account for about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the vote of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of the vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the 2016 suburbs, his follow-up there has declined significantly.
Although there are differences between surveys, Biden has measured about fifteen percentage points of Trump's advantage in the outposts in recent times.
Regis Philbin is dead
American television personality Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.
Philbin served as actor, director, presenter and singer for about six decades.
He is one of the best known for directing the popular talk show Live! with Regis between 1988 and 2011 alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
Then he has directed such shows as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent most hours on American television and has been recognized by that subject.
He received six Emmy Awards in a career and was overall nominated 37 times.
It is stated in a statement from his family that Philbin died of natural orcs.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have recalled him on social media over the past 24 hours.
Will the Olympic fire be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only World War II has paved up to this point, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic fire would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," presumably referring to a pandemic of coronavirus that the world is now trailing through together.
Abolition workers have a year more to prepare, and authorities in Japan are improving costs due to the delay.
However, everyone holds a head ends up much at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the site of this year's Olympic Games, the cheering of the Japanese representatives was genuine.
They cried and laughed alternately, since Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 games but bowed it the time in lower for Rio in Brazil.
This time Tokyo City and Japan were to bathe in the world's attention.
The games were scheduled to take place between 24 July and 9 August, but have been postponed by a year and instead start on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If the games fail to be held then, if the crown virus still becomes too much of a threat, the games will be cancelled.
No one wants to think that way to the end, though.
Olympics are no regular sports competition.
Nothing is save, the show is always supposed to be fantastic and seeks to topple the last game.
The choice of city for Olympics is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.
The grander the publicity — the more likely the nostalgia is.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to hold the 2016 Olympics or more than $20 billion.
The second time, when applying for the 2020 Games, $75 million, about ten billion, was put into the presentation.
By 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the games this year, Japanese authorities had thus already spent $30 billion on the project.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to how much it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums, and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to handle such tournaments, prepare them, and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been going on these days but have been postponed by one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from a state reviewer in Japan released at the end of last year stated that the cost was nearly double that number.
The cost of suspending the games will probably not be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 billion and $30 billion.
There are so high numbers that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic government only virtued for about half the Olympics, given the lowest possible cost.
Olympics is an event of the magnitude that they tend to have become the subject of discussion by economists, who try to scour numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the shortest case, quite a lot of people seem to have concluded that the Olympics' impact is less than so positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, increasing the number of jobs very much in the short term, but in the long run cities tend to sit up with debt tails and the terrible cost of operating little used manpower.
Rio in Brazil is sitting up with significant debts due to the 2016 games and has been in trouble costing maintenance of all the large sportsmen built for the games.
Figures have been lost after the 2012 London Games, but it has revealed that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
This means that there was only a small amount of new jobs.
In general, cities have not come out particularly well of financially holding Olympics because of the slagging costs associated with the structures built for the games.
However, benefits tend to be considered to include increased traffic of tourists wishing to visit the Olympic cities following the games, which is however highly uncertain regarding the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether all the number of viewers who usually attend the games will be accepted.
The main issue, however, is the honor the cities must have, but he is hard to value for money.
For despite the enormous cost, one can also say that the joy brought by the games is not that it can be put on a price tag.
But although the show tends to be magnificent and nowhere to be saved, of course, it's not just about money.
It is the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some accomplished people, it is surprising to just be welcome to postpone the games.
For example, the Australian five-timer and gold medalist in her article at the page Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is a cassolian and would have been away from good fun this summer but sees hope of having entered a competitive form for the 2021 Games.
It is therefore among the athletes who are just rather pleased with the suspension, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after the games this year, they would have been held on time, means the suspension of the games in some cases they will retire from competition before the games take place.
Simply do not trust his body to go through a further year of rigorous practice.
Few athletes placed as thoroughly in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She brought home four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his native United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to the 2021 Games, however, she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of the games next year, since then she will be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is in the higher order for a female gymnast in the front row.
‘This is a sensitive issue,' says Biles, yet smiles into another in an interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee asking if she intends to reach as far in the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I just don't know if I'll still be at the top after a year more of rehearsals," Biles says.
She has previously talked about her body not enduring the stress of gymnastics training much longer.
Nevertheless, she trains hard for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop practicing when the pandemic stood at its highest and the gymnasium was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form is certainly a little better than that of most people.
“ We have a rigid plan now.
It was difficult to start training first again after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we're back in full momentum, and I'll increase my practice steadily as the year progresses.
Of course, we do not know exactly what these games will be like or whether they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, cannot do otherwise.
I've worked too hard to leave the sport now," Biles says.
With her like others, doubt slumbers or perhaps rather consciousness that the situation may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
Forecasting, however, is hopeless.
No one can know what the situation of the coronavirus pandemic will be like in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics in terms of their being held as a year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid Tunnel.
Suspended Wedding Due to an Epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was scheduled to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about now," the actress said in a conversation with People.
“ We really want to get married sometime and have that dream wedding, and we want all those who are dear to us.
But we decided to postpone it and focus on what is important now, and that is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I look more to the world than to wedding affairs these days.
There are a lot of things going on and we are supposed to focus our attention on what's going on in the world."
