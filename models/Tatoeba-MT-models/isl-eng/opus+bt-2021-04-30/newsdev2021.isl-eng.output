Biden leads polls in three key states
When only 100 days are up for election, Joe Biden, a Democratic candidate, enjoys an advantage in three important swing states.
CNN reports today that Biden was over in Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden measures with a 51% turnout versus 46% of the president's follow-up.
In Arizona, the position is 49%—45% in favour of Biden, and in Michigan it is heading to Biden's overtime victory, because there it leads with 12 points, 52%—40%.
To win the November election, after 100 days, Trump has to reverse all these states, and indeed more.
Trump sits up these days with a coronavirus epidemic that the nationals increasingly blame him for, saying the vast majority of the advocacy states have reacted badly, or very badly at the beginning of the outbreak.
In addition, Trump has come offside badly from protests and riots that arose during George Floyd's death.
Think Trump and his government have reacted badly or wrongly to those issues.
To crown Trump's dilemma, he is now facing serious criticism for ordering FBI officers to crack down on protests in cities where city or governors are Democrats.
Has it created an enormous wolf spray among the citizens of the cities, and that anger is spread over to other Americans.
Images of FBI agents tipping protesters into unmarked cars have also not helped the United States cause.
Watched the advertisement of The Lincoln Project very much attention to this, but it can be seen here below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with very little vote difference.
In fact, Trump defeated very many states with little vote difference, defeating the election by a minority of votes.
Michigan, for example, defeated him by just 10,704 votes.
It is less than 0.5% of the population.
Nearly all the polls that political commentators say are significant are showing the same result, Biden is taken forward.
A new survey by CNN in Arizona shows that Biden's advantage is now beyond the survey's margin of error.
Similarly, surveys by CNN and Quinnipiac University say about Florida.
Even Fox News, which leans well right and expressed support for Trump 2016, has published surveys of the same content in its media.
The president's last hope, according to the results of the quizzes, is that Trump might be hoping to re-establish a following in important places within swing states if attention in the campaign is focused on the economy.
The United States economy took a heavy hit following the Covid-19 pandemic, but voters do not appear to be linking the economic shock to the coronavirus pandemic.
That is, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for being badly affected by the response to the coronavirus pandemic, but rely on him better to deal with the economic crisis that strikes the state at this time.
However, Trump has fared poorly in directing the debate during the campaign.
Following the riots that have been on fire almost continuously since reports of the video were received sinisterly as four police officers killed George Floyd, Trump attempted to direct the debate over to law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order, became his hallmarks.
It now seems to have failed completely, which was said earlier.
As polls lean more on Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to abandon Trump and declare support for either Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without explicitly naming him by name.
This they do because of the arrangement in the United States to vote in many elections on the same ballot.
Thus, a voter can simply label with the second party in the presidential election portion of the ballot, and let it alone apply as a vote for all other candidates of that party on the ballot.
Thus, Republican Party candidates for other offices are tempted to break away from Trump's relaxed gang and gain independent results in the election.
Youth Olympic Games in Dakar postponed to 2026
Youth Olympics were scheduled to take place in Dakar next year, but they have now been postponed to 2026 due to the coronavirus pandemic after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal reached an agreement on it.
However, the suspension of the first Olympics to take place in Africa is a blow to many young athletes.
Volunteer arrested over the fire in Nantes
A volunteer in Nantes Cathedral, France, has been arrested in connection with a fire that completely destroyed the church.
Le Monde quotes prosecutors as saying that the suspect, a Rwandan refugee who served as an overseer in the church, admitted to starting the fire.
The man's lawyer says in conversation with another media that the man deeply regrets his actions.
Among the things destroyed in the fire was a 17th-century organ and historic picturesque windows of the church.
The volunteer, who is 39 years old but has not been named for a name, was arrested shortly after the fire on July 18 last July, but he was then released.
He was then given back to reporting yesterday and subsequently remanded into custody.
‘No way out of this'
I am well received at the home of Baltasar and Christian Samper in Copavogi.
The occasion of my visit is Baltasar's new art exhibition and his daughter, Mireya, which will be opened on August 1 in the barn of Little Camb on the Snaefell.
Is this the first time Fathers show together.
I am brought down to Baltasar's workshop, where monumental paintings confront me.
Large and gloomy depictions of women of early times but also of flying creatures; eagles on one, shades of birds on another.
From the workshop, there is a spread towards the home.
"We had a horse right here with us that bit the grass," Baltasar tells me.
‘The horse works much better than a mower on these hills and hills we have.'
Mireya is with us Christian and Baltasar, and she recounts how her work rhymes with the works that are here.
“ Instincts, a combination of paperworks and decorative sculpture.
They're all very white and infested with what Dad's doing, where I'm working with the light and like that," she says.
“ It’s been a year since that idea came up.
Then there were certain works I was doing and would have wanted to show there, but they got stuck in Tokyo because of Covid.
When my dad had started painting and I saw where he was going, I rethinked my part," says Mireya but Baltasar's work has a strong appeal in Icelandic folklore about women's shoes and wets.
"When I saw that Dad was doing these paintings with the women, I thought it ideal to do a jewel associated with them," says Mireya, whose adornment she works with Victor Inga's son Bear's goldsmith in Sign's shop.
"Then I make penetration out of the ornament."
Last year, Mireya attended a show of 72 artists of the Academy of Sensation of Snaefell, including the barn at Little Cambi and found the building fascinating.
‘This is a new space, an old barn that has just been renovated,' says Mireya but she chatted there with Baldvina Sverrissdóttir's artist, who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar set up an exhibition together.
“ She wanted us both to show, and we thought:
“ Why not?
This is a good idea."
Born in 1938 in Spain, Baltasar Samper attended the University of Art in Barcelona before holding a world-record program to study art collections and conduct research.
He stopped here in Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by land and nation.
Here he came back a short time later, met his wife, Christian, and has lived here continuously since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a prolific artist, having held dozens of private exhibitions, and exhibitions with Christian in many places.
He is best known for his large murals, including a mural in Flat Island Church and a fresco in Widespread Church.
‘What affects what I do is the bitter things Iceland has and no other place,' Baltasar says.
“ These low suns and these shadows that stretch and stretch.
As soon as I got here, I thought, 'Wow, here you can work.'
Mireya is the eldest of the children of Christian and Baltasar, born in 1964.
‘There was one thing I knew, it was quite clear that I wasn't going to be an artist,' she asks if she wanted to follow in her parents' footsteps.
“ So I went on a high school math and naturalistic course and did everything I could to get out of this.
Then I realized I was on the run.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laughs.
She has, like her father, exhibited in many parts of the world.
Much in Japan, to form.
All of Baltasar's and Christian's children have followed the art road.
"I call this a virus," Mireya says.
‘There was no way out of this.'
Considers Icelandair to have been in grey territory when flight attendants were dismissed
The Minister for Social Affairs believes Icelandair was in a grey area when the company dismissed all flight attendants in the midst of a core dispute.
He then claims to have requested that a law that prevents firefighters from entering residences be taken for examination after the fire on the Brotherhood Trail.
On 17 July, Icelandair was shocked to resign all of the 38 flight attendants who then served with the company while the clemency at the Aviation Society was still on the board of state eighties.
There was a divisional denomination as to whether Icelandair was allowed to resort to these layoffs and it was prepared for the case to be resolved before Social Justice.
However, this never came to an end, the flight attendants and Icelandair gathered over 24 hours after the layoffs.
However, Asmund Einar Dadason, the Social Security Minister, says that in his mind that Icelandair's decision was in a grey area and went to the rights of wage workers.
“ My view is that it is a specific right to defend wage earners.
When you are in talks, when you are inside a settlement, it is not an option to go this way.
It is absolutely clear to me that this would not have passed.
I think it's quite clear, to me, that men had entered a grey area there as to what this touched," says Asgard.
He thus will not speak for other companies to go the same way as Icelandair.
"One also now sees a dangerous debate that it is only natural to begin to shuffle this system up in order to reduce this right, so I am totally opposed."
At an explosion this morning, Asgard was also asked about the government's response to the fire on the Brotherhood Trail at the end of June, where three people were killed.
The minister says the investigation of the case now at the table of the Housing and Humanities Institute, to which he directed the recommendations.
“ It is within the law today that fire departments are not allowed to enter residences.
I have asked the Housing and Humanities Agency to look specifically at whether there is any reason to undergo any legal changes.
I am prepared to perform the legal changes needed to reduce the likelihood that this can happen again," says Asgard Einar.
You can listen to the interview with Asmund as a whole in the player below.
United States said to increase pressure on contractor Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
The U.S. government has made further efforts to force European companies to abandon the gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2, led by Russia, according to Welt am Sonntag, which cites people who are aware of the issue.
According to the newspaper, U.S. State Department officials, the U.S. Department of Finance and the U.S. Department of Energy have contacted European contractors to ensure they are aware of the consequences of continuing in the project.
Up to twelve officials are to have held at least two online meetings with representatives of the companies in recent days.
Those who witnessed the talks said that the Americans had in a "friendly" tone stressed that the United States wanted to prevent Nord Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
‘I believe this is a very, very serious threat,' said one alcohol wiper to the German media.
These threats are in line with the remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week, when he warned that companies involved in the project would be best "get out now" or risk penalties under 232 portions of the infamous Counter America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy giant Gazprom, which oversees the development of the project, five European companies are involved.
These are French company Engie, OMV of Austria, British-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell as well as Wintershall and Uniper of Germany.
In a conversation with Welt am Sonntag, a representative of the latter company said that U.S. efforts to undermine "important infrastructure projects" were a clear intervention in the sovereignty of European countries.
Earlier this week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an amendment to the National Defense Act designed to expand U.S. sanctions against companies involved in the installation of the Russian Nord Stream 2-gas pipeline.
According to one of the legislature's transport operators, the resources can focus on companies that pay for or provide ships, insurance, port facilities or connectivity services for such vessels, as well as those that offer certification for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of U.S. efforts to interfere with European energy by using sanctions against Nord Stream 2, and some of them have even called for Brussels to work on countermeasures.
Moscow officials have also strongly criticized the operation from Washington, calling it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, a spokesman for the presidency, Dmitrij Peskov, said Russia would come up with a new plan for how the project will be completed if Washington officials hold the new sanctions to stress.
Prepares for further transfer of public agencies to the country
The Minister for Social Affairs and Children's Affairs is planning to move more public institutions out of the country in the near future.
The Department of Housing and Human Services' fire safety field will be moved north to Sheep Creek in the fall to the minister's decision, but experts within the department have previously declared that they do not intend to move farm transport north.
Asmund Einar Dadason, Minister for Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, said in Explosives at the Wave this morning that it is important for the countryside to be moved there by public institutions.
It is accompanied by a great production of values that also creates diversity.
“ It is of national importance, we are trying to build everything around the country.
Employment structure, currency-creating structure, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some natural exploitation and this type of work as public jobs are they support very well for that structure," says Asgard.
"Shakes increased diversity, creates better support for this resource exploitation and the nation's currency creation."
Asmund's decision to move the fire safety field of the Housing and Human Services Agency has been strongly criticized by its staff and the National Union of Fire and Ambulance.
Six men who have expertise in fire cases and serve in the department are all living in the capital area, and none of them intend to move to Sheep Creek.
“ I think it is quite clear that there are politically divided opinions about how hard this is going to take place.
My view is, and has always been, that we are to engage in radical measures in order to better distribute the public functions," says Asgard.
"We see that our neighbouring nations, the Norwegians and the Danes have been doing this successfully."
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
"I think further political decisions have to be made about the movement of public works abroad, as I was doing with the Housing and Humanities Organization."
He takes examples of the Food Institute's move to Selfoss, Iceland's Land Measures to Akraness, and Unemployment Insurance in Skaga Beach.
“ Today, there is a workplace in Skaga Beach that is of great importance to that community.
I think we should take further steps into this creature."
“ I am preparing for further steps into this creature.
Further transport."
On the fifth dozen arrested in Seattle
Systematic racism and the decision by the President of the United States to send federal police forces into cities to dismiss riots were protested in many places yesterday.
In the fifth dozen protesters were arrested in Seattle.
Seattle police used flare bombs and pepper spray during a large protest there yesterday, which police have described as rioting.
21 police officers were injured and at least 45 protesters were arrested.
Two months ago, a wave of protests against systematic racism began in the United States after a police officer killed George Floyd.
There was a blow to the protesters to show solidarity to protesters in Portland.
There has repeatedly come into heavy conflict between police and protesters after the President of the United States sent there a force of FBI officers, who have been driving around on unmarked cars, in untapped authorities.
Thousands gathered in Portland this weekend, using police tear gas and rubber bullets as they struck critically between them and protesters.
Had a Miracle Child at 47
American reality star Kenya Moore makes a good impression by strengthening people in need of training.
Moore, who is known for his involvement in The Real Housewives of Atlanta, had his first child aged 47 after an assisted training program, calling his daughter the miracle child.
"Await almost my whole life after having a child," Moore said in an interview with People.
"So I know the anguish people feel, especially women feel, thinking I could possibly not have a child."
Moore realized she was running out of time when she turned 40.
“ I didn’t want to have a baby alone.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after 40 years of age, I looked up and thought my god good," said Moore who didn't know her child's father, however, until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The Reality Star says his daughter is a miracle child in more ways than one.
In addition to Moore being older than most early starters, her daughter came into the world one and a half months before the set date.
Moore went into an imperial section that proved difficult and took much longer than a traditional imperial section.
"I call it the Miracle Babb because it was a child that everyone said was almost no chance for me to have," Moore said during the interview.
Fathers arrested in Mizoram with a worth of 15.4 million rupees of heroin
The value of the heroin in the home market was about 15.5 million rupees, so it was smuggled from Myanmar, according to police.
A man and his son were arrested with 1.9 kg of heroin in the Hnahthial district of Mizoram, near the border with Myanmar, police were quoted as saying on Sunday.
The value of the heroin in the home market was about 15.5 million rupees, so it was smuggled from Myanmar, according to police.
Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested with the drugs on Friday night in the village of Ngharchhip, police said.
They also lost about 280 grams of heroin, worth about 1.5 million rupees, when they swam over, during their escape from police, according to the office.
According to police information, this is believed to be one of the greatest quantities of heroin ever laid hold in the state.
The accused were brought to trial under the relevant articles of the Drugs and Sensational Drugs (NDPS) Act of 1985.
Even if border crossings between states and with Myanmar are closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, there is no death of drug smuggling and other commodities, according to police information.
Team members of the Assam rifles recently seized 25 truckloaded betel nuts smuggled from Myanmar, worth about 40 million rupees.
A doctor ran 35 miles in a mask
British physician Tom Lawton ran on the days of 35 miles wearing a face mask to show that the amount of armor did not diminish when wearing a face mask.
Lawton is a doctor at Bradford Royal Hospital and has worked there during the pandemic.
In order to disprove the doctrine of rudeness and in order to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run to work and back again in a mask.
Before departing, he set up a collection of GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust, which manages food gifts in Bradford and throughout the UK.
“ I am a great supporter of all that keeps us safe.
That's why I've been in shock at the misinformation that's been passed on to people that face masks reduce the amount of armor in people," Lawton said.
Lawton said that he had previously competed in a triathlete, but during the pandemic, his endurance had decreased.
On Monday last he ran the 35 miles.
"I never took the mask off (no food or drink) and the hard work stubbornly stubbornly rose 98% every time I looked," Lawton wrote on Twitter at the end of the race.
Prince Joakim Still in Hospital
Prince Joakim of Denmark now lies at the University Hospital in Toulouse, France, and his condition is stable.
The prince underwent brain surgery yesterday after being diagnosed with a blood clot.
“ Prince Joakim’s stand is still constant.
The prince blessedly came into the hands of the professionals in time and feels well after incidents.
It is too early to tell how long he will be in the hospital at this moment," says Lene Balleby, information agent for Danish royal hallarinanr, in a written reply to Danish state radio.
Only a few days have passed since the royal family celebrated the 18th anniversary of Prince Felix the son of Joakim, his second son.
The birthday was celebrated at the Queen's vineyard, the Château de Cayx in Cahors in southern France.
The family was still there on vacation when Joakim was hospitalized yesterday.
Joakim, aged 51, emigrated to France last year, where he is studying at the Ecolé Military School, the first Dana.
Then he works as a defence expert at the Danish Embassy in Paris.
The Prince's French connection is strong, as is his late father, Prince Henry, French, and his wife, Princess Mary, as well.

Utah plane crash: child and two adults killed in back yard crash"
Six people were aboard a Piper PA-32 plane that crashed into a backyard in the city of West Jordan in the afternoon of Saturday, according to Allen Kenitzer, a spokesman for the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Three of those on board died, including the 43-year-old pilot Lee Wyckoff, his 9-month-old child, and Milda Shibonis, 36, according to West Jordan police authorities.

Gottlieb warns that the smooth spread of the coronavirus in a community makes it "very difficult" for schools to open in the fall
Washington – Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, warned Sunday that it will be "very difficult" for school districts to open in a new year of study if the coronavirus spreads smoothly within these communities.
“ I believe that local school authorities need to look at what the distribution is like within the community.
If the virus spreads unopposed in the community, it will be very difficult to open in that condition," said Gottlieb in "Face the Nation".
Since fall semester is scheduled to begin over the next few weeks, the Trump administration had urged school authorities to open their schools to students and offer instruction in the schools five days a week.
However, these efforts by President Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos come a week after Trump warned that the coronavirus pandemic would likely "reverse before it improves" and confirmed that school districts in the places where the situation is worst may need to delay school opening by several weeks.
Nevertheless, Centers for Disease Control issued instructions on Thursday on how to most safely open schools to students.
The guidelines include calls for a distance between people secured, students and staff advised to use facial protection, and for students to be divided into defined groups to reduce the number of means of transmission.
However, the Centers for Disease Control did not issue criteria for school administrators as to when to close schools if the number of coronavirus infections is increasing, which Gottlieb says was "unheelable".
"When this state of uncertainty prevails and precise guidelines have not been given on how the schools will be opened, I think more parents will be careful," he says.
"That's why I think it's very important to get detailed information about exactly what the standards are, which the Centers for Disease Control did not provide in their guidelines."
Gottlieb said school districts must think about the percentage of positive infections in the community, local spread and test capacity when decisions are made on whether to keep schools open or to switch to online teaching entirely.
If between 5 and 10% of analyses deliver a positive result "the issue starts to get difficult" but over 10% is "the threshold when it needs to be carefully considered whether to close the school districts."
"This is a sign that the outbreak has gained a foothold in the community," said Gottlieb, adding that this would make parts of the state of Florida, which is central to the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, difficult to open to teaching in schools next month.
The number of coronavirus infections has increased to more than 30 states and the District of Colombia, while the epicenter of the outbreak is currently in the so-called solar belt on the southern coast of the United States.
Gottlieb, however, said that there were signs that it had begun to slow the increase in the number of cases in some states, including Arizona and Texas.
However, despite Gottlieb having said that there were "clear signs" that the epidemic was beginning to slow down in some states in the solar belt, it is beginning to "hit in the coal" in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indian, and Illinois.
Many governors have made rules that require people to use masks in public crypts and stop stage-shift re-opening to resist the spread of the coronavirus.
Gottlieb said that states should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas and other locations offering indoor entertainment, and setting rules for mask use to overcome the pandemic, which are measures that allow states to avoid reinstatement of the strict restrictions imposed at the beginning of the March pandemic.
In addition to the fact that various states have made mask use compulsory, various companies have required people to use face protection.
The quickbit giant McDonald's is the latest company to make the use of face protection compulsory, adding it to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks, and others that have regulated their own mask use.
Gottlieb said that he expected more companies to adopt mask duties with him, especially as the risk is considered high.
"If we can really control the epidemic when winter goes on until we get a vaccine or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease, we can do it with masks, it's relatively simple, something we can all do but that doesn't directly change our lives and lets us keep what's very important to us, like keeping some companies open and getting the kids back to school," he says.
Although Donald Trump last week did not say that he wanted to make mask use compulsory in the entire country, he urged Americans last week to use facial protection, saying at a White House press conference that "they had an impact".
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: 'It's news to expect'
Crystal Palace's proprietors received a plaque for the summer when Roy Hodgson, the company's CEO, declared the parishioner Ms Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the company.
The fixture has played at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now appears to be leaving, having previously been worded to teams such as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
As he is now 27 years old, it is yet to be revealed whether teams in that quality are still willing to pay high sums for him, especially during the sport's financial uncertainty this summer, after a season in which Zaha scored four goals and made five assists for a Palace team that disappointed several.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that "report was to be expected" regarding Zaha's possible departure after confirming that the offensive player had "declared it clearly" that he saw his future elsewhere than that of the club.
There are still three years left of the parishioner's contract with Palace, and last year the company indicated that 100 million sterling would be needed for the company to surrender him.
Hodgson's team finished the season with seven consecutive losses and a draw on the last day of the season, which resulted in the team falling to 14th place.
Zaha found the netmasks only once from mid-December to the end of the season with a long shot in a loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for sales last summer as he tried to get away from the company, but no offer was received to tempt Palace to sell.
Zaha changed his agent in January, apparently to increase his chances of succeeding in leaving the company, and in the following weeks it will undoubtedly become his priority to secure social exchange.
Zaha is the player who played the most minutes in the English Premier League for Palace during the season and was the only player of the team under the age of 28, who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much rebuilding the team might be necessary to attack with the funds obtained for the player.
Hurricane Hanna: Texas's coronavirus-stricken state faces high risk of disaster flooding in a "double slam"
Weather reporters have predicted "vehicle flooding" in southern Texas after Hurricane Hanna reached land twice, resulting in heavy rains and wind concentrations of up to 40 feet per second.
Upon reaching shore on Saturday, it was classified as a first-level storm (the lowest level on a five-point scale) and it has now been brought down to a tropical storm, but rain could still reach 150-300 mm on Sunday and wind could reach 26 meters in seconds.
In some areas, rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County at the Mexico border.
Hanna was the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield advised residents to be well on guard: "This is not nearly over yet, we are still expecting disaster flooding."
In recent weeks, Texas has struggled with a large increase in coronavirus transmission.
Governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster notice for 23 counties that will be in the path of the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ Every hurricane is a huge challenge.
This challenge is complicated and even more difficult as the hurricane passes through an area that has been worst hit by COVID-19," Greg said.
The hurricane first came to land at 17:00 on Saturday, 24 miles north of Port Mansfield, which is about 210 miles south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far from, in eastern Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
Emergency services in Corpus Christi set up parks near an intersection to allow them to be used if streets will be flooded.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in a titular statement that the government was monitoring Hannah and Hurricane Douglas, heading towards Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the coast in Corpus Christi, said that the storm approaching had increased the anxiety she felt as a result of the pandemic.
This 67-year-old woman had largely stayed home due to health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double plaque for us.
I think a lot of people have become nervous.
We're gonna get through this.
It's all good and strong and stand together."
A Message on a Bluesing Sailor in the South
Hearings in the South have gone unusually well in summer, the weather having been favorable to farmers.
Most have finished with a first beat, a second beat has been widely started, and it is expected that some will reach a third beat at the end of the summer.
The weather has played with Sunni farmers like other residents of the country's part this summer and not a spoil spring for on farms' barrels.
Therefore, it has been successful.
Sigurður Augustsson, a cow farmer in Birtingaholt, Hrunamann, and a contractor in hay-cream are satisfied and happy.
“ Yeah, it's just been brilliant, I think farmers must just be steep, they've been doing great, and they've been having very good weather for the last half of the month.
Hearing is a very good end the harvest good and the quality of the fights finely covered," says Victor.
Victor says that it is growing, especially in cow farmers that they are haying in flat pits or outposts, which have given way to very well, yet it is by far the most to do in the rolling ear.
“ It's lively, yes, yes, it's actually been really comfortable now for the last two weeks or three weeks, it's been so dry and good and it's so comfortable to deal with it.
It'll remember everything, it's less stressful and can be stored to the morning sometimes what could be done today, so it's brilliantly comfortable.
But does Victor think that some peasants will strike three times?
“ Yes, I could believe that, the first ones.
We started on June 17th, it might quite be that those who were first need to take three times something."
Original Solution by the Wolves - This is how they prevent the injuries
Kantman Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English league, is an extremely fast player.
His opponents have had it to grab hold of him to make sure he can't get past them.
This has caused his shoulder to fall apart several times, but now the wolves have brought a solution to the problem.
The Sun reports this.
In the Wolves' game against Crystal Palace, a paramedic could be seen smearing something on Traoré's shoulders.
‘This is something we had to do to protect Traoré,' says a source within Wolves but what was being applied to him was baby oil.
"The making him more slippery makes it harder for defenders to grab hold of him, and so we can prevent further injuries."
Traoré's shoulder first fell out of action when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has fallen out of the team four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Prince Harry of England: A friend of the Duke of Sussex protests claims in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott said in a conversation with Sky News that the contents of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were in no way different from the content of the gossip magazines, the only difference being that the book was embedded.
The former soldier wants the sea to be increasingly focused on the positive things that he and his wife have contributed, such as their charity work.
Stott said, "I feel that what appears there is nothing different from what we read in the gossip magazines, except now only in an inbound book."
‘There's a narrator telling, there's still nothing certain that this is from them.'
"I just think this is another attack on them, just like the gossip magazines that persecute them."
"I realize they're in the limelight and people want to know what they're doing, but I wish there was more to it about all the good things they've done and their charity work, rather than their personal affairs."
‘Of course, they never get away from it, for their own sake.'
The support of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex overshadowed other members of the royal family, according to a specialist in the history of the royal family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had been unable to exploit the star popularity of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for their own benefit.
She added that the order of power within the royal family was firmly established, but that it was not possible to direct what interested the public.
She also said, "The fact is that everything they did in support of the Queen tended to overshadow other members of the royal family, and this was considered to be a problem."
"They're extremely popular."
"They had less weddings than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding."
"But though Harry and Meghan's wedding was smaller in profile than that of William and Catherine, there was a newscast of it as much, due to the world's high interest in the couple."
Donald Trump admits he often regrets his ruse on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often regrets his entries on Twitter that fuel war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the President of the United States said that his unannounced re-published Twitter entries – some of which have contained material from white racists – get him in the most trouble.
When journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he regretted his entries, Trump replied: “Oft, too often.
It was that way in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very large.
You put it on your desk and then you came back the next day and said, 'Oh, how glad I am I'm not sending this,' right?
But we don't do it via Twitter.
We send it out right away, we feel great, and then you start getting calls – 'Did you really say that?'
I say 'What's wrong with this?' and you find out some things."
Last month, Trump caused a lot of anger after re-publishing an entry (distributing material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area of Florida, where an elderly couple called "White power!" or "the power of whites".
And in 2017, Trump reprised three entries directed against Muslims, published by Jayda Fransen, leader of the right-wing faction Britain First.
The president told Portnoy that the re-releases that had put him in the most trouble
Trump said, "You see something that looks good and doesn't investigate it, you understand, and you don't know exactly what it says on your helmet, which is a little bit and you don't expand it, sometimes – I've found that it's almost always the redundancies that get you in trouble."
The president often shares compliments to himself, rallies about his opponents, and conspiracy theories with his 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump tells Twitter to help him reach through the so-called "false news" on TV shows and newspapers, which he says is permeated by the untrue.
But the President's own lies have often found their way under the microscope, and now Trump's Twitter entries mean as a misrepresentation.
The GPS may be uninsured
Many states work to establish a different location technology from the GPS system.
An engineering lecturer says that there may be a reason to worry about the safety of the GPS system, which is owned by the United States Army.
The old Loran system has undergone renovation days.
The GPS will follow us at every footing.
We use it when we fly, sail, and sail, when surveying land, in industry, and in leisure.
Most people do not think of it as a military device owned by the United States Army, which first opened it to general use in the 1980s.
GPS technology uses coordinates from satellite at 20,000 kilometers above Earth, and therefore conditions in nature have little effect on it.
“ But it is very easy to interrupt.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these signals," says Sæmundur E. Þorsteinsson, lecturer in engineering at the University of Iceland and expert on risk management and security of communications.
He also says it is easy to send error signals with the wrong location, such as in warfare.
"The GPS system is owned by the U.S. Department of Defense.
They have assured the public that the system is ready at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it fell into the head of a very eccentric president to have such a thing done, he could presumably do it," says Seamund.
Therefore, many states are considering alternative systems and location technologies.
Both Russians and Chinese operate their own satellite systems, and the European Union is launching the Galileo location system.
"The Galileo system is built primarily for civilian use.
It may have more accuracy and is naturally dominated by the European Union.
Then there is not one government that dominates it entirely but many," says Seamund.
But many people are also looking back at the old loran technique.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the 1960s until GPS technology took over.
The loran signals are sent on very long waves from the transmitters down on the ground.
"There is then a new version of the Loran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, men are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a system for backup, because it requires a bit of other laws to interfere with it, it's much harder than disrupting satellite systems," says Seamund.
However, it is probably the safest access to as many location systems as possible.
Experienced Member of Parliament Vern Buchanan dead from the coronavirus
"Gary was a professional forward in finger goons and a devoted servant of the public sector," Buchanan said on Facebook.
“ He touched the lives of so many and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how invigorating he was, the sense of humor and the one-loved joy he received from helping others."
Buchanan's office published a statement in a titter earlier this month stating that Tibbetts had had no recent contact with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
The state of Florida has reported 414,511 cases since the start of the pandemic, which is more than the 411,200 cases in New York, according to health officials in the states.
State health officials' data shows that hospital admissions have increased 79% since the U.S. national holiday, July 4.
The data also shows that at least 50 intensive care units in Florida reached tolerance levels on Saturday.
"We reported that this could have an impact," DeSantis said in June.
‘At the same time, police work and putting the sanctions on this could have a reverse effect.'
Flying from Horned Bay to Cape Town
Turkey pigeon, rosestar, ring pigeon, cross-nosed, glittling can, and cryrays are among the birds that have become entangled so far in the country this summer.
On the site of the Southeastern Bird Observatory, birds.is can be seen almost daily brief news reports of the wanderings, where they have been seen, and sometimes their sex.
They are many of the bird enthusiasts in Iceland.
To mark this, there are a number of people who like Facebook page Icelandic bird species.
There are about 14,600 members of the group.
It shares images of birds and obvious that Iceland is rich in good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
Brynjulfsson is one of them.
Binni, as he is called, is an employee of the Southeastern Bird Observatory and the Southeast Nature Bureau, and closely monitors the bird life in that area.
He speaks beautifully of these animals that enrich the lifespan in Iceland and play an important role, and it does not matter whether the bird is a large and great bird of prey or a small sparrow.
The Bird Observatory was established in 2005 on the anniversary of Half Dead Björnsson on the Cwiskers in the Desert with the aim of promoting and continuing the significant natural studies he conducted as early as 1940.
"Halfdán was thirteen years old when he began to make information about birds," Brynjulf says in a conversation with the Core.
"We at the bird observatory are not doing exactly what Half Dead did but are building on top of his data by counting and marking birds."
Half-dead was a farmer and general scientist, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote numerous scientific articles on plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on 10 February 2017, aged almost 90.
Half - dead and his siblings in the Cwischers attracted the interest of many whom they met in Icelandic nature.
In that group is Björn Gísli Eagleson, "the employee" of the Bird Observatory.
Björn grew up on the Reynauds in the South, and he was given a rich natural pedigree by his neighbour, Half-Death on the Cwistles.
But what is it now that the Southeastern Bird Observatory does?
Around 20 March each year, the Bird Observatory installs a special bird network in the Strait of Ones, a grove of trees a short distance within the Port of Horn.
It makes standard markings of the birds that come into the nets.
The nets are taken down around May 10 as the laying time begins.
The nets are up every day, at least from about 6:00 a.m. until noon.
And they have to be visited every hour.
The birds that come in are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a journalist asks in the forewing.
“ Yes, we split it with ourselves, me and Björss.
Since we now have to work for ourselves, this can be a substantial puzzle but somehow we manage to do this," Brynjulf says.
The networks are then resurfaced in the period August 1 to November 10 — all days allowed by weather.
Between patrolling the nets and during the periods that they are not up, Brynjulf and Björn are marking terns, scooters, and various mosses where they reach them.
In addition, they take on a number of special projects.
One of these projects is carried out in partnership with the Icelandic Institute of Natural Sciences and is about collecting forest mites of birds.
“ The forest mite jumps on the birds at their winter stations and then gets a ride with them here to land in the spring.
This occurs shortly before they leave, and therefore these mites are not large when they arrive in Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find himself some other host when he needs it."
But enough about mites.
Asked about how the birds in the Southeast have it this summer, Brynjulf says that the herb of the crest seems to be going well — as it overhead lays.
“ The main spoiler of the tern here is at Hala, South, where everything is going well.
But there is, on the other hand, no more lay at the Jackal River where a few years ago there was a huge lay."
He says that a few years ago, more than a thousand crores have been destroyed there, but that they can now be counted on the fingers of one hand.
"When we look at bogs and waterfowl, I feel reduced in the last few years what you find from them.
But, of course, there's always a change between years."
What can explain that great change is, according to Bryno, most likely about the supply of food.
‘It's all about food, too.'
In that case, humans may also have their own work to say about the survival of birds and other animals.
But some birds seem to have quite a good thing in the Southeast this summer.
‘One of the things I find positive is that the vote is to increase again after a great depression,' says Brynjulf, ‘but while the skum has deteriorated catastrophically in recent years and decades.'
Of sparrows, it is learned that it seems that the mariat is going to do well in its litter this summer, as it was last year.
Forest thrifts and dufuttens had declined somewhat, but Brynjulf says it is not revealed until the fall how this summer proved to be theirs.
But turn to the wanderings.
Often they attract a lot of attention, especially if they are very ignorant and even colorful.
These two notable features have about one of the most popular vagrants of the summer: the Rosary.
‘Another has been relatively quiet this summer in the wanderings,' Brynjulf says but mentions that in the countryside there is now a cry and then ring pigeons have been seen and are beginning to lay here.
When Brynjulfur and Björn come across strays, they also mark them, just like other birds.
Meanings are international, and they are practiced throughout the world.
A number of things can be reached by the markings, such as what the bird's wintering stations are, where they lay, and what their migrations are.
"You can even see how long they're flying," Brynjulf points out.
This information is useful in many ways, to form when it comes to epidemics such as bird flu.
‘The knowledge is always being increased.'
If anyone in the world finds a bird that has been marked by the Southeastern Bird Observatory, the information is sent to the Icelandic Institute of Natural Sciences.
“ We have been recovered from Cape Town, South Africa.
There was a tern that we had marked.
One tern from us was found later in the United States."
One bird is the Brynjulf especially mindset and that is the skum.
‘The cum is our bird,' he says, pointing out that the Bird Observatory and the Southeastern Nature Office have their mission to observe its survival — which has become quite relaxed and now it has arrived on a wow list.
It is difficult to claim what caused a crash in the stock, but one theory is that the schooner made seafood that was once dumped by fishing boats and into the sea for good but that it is now beginning to make much better use of it and this affects the schooner.
Are you in the best place in the country to watch birds?
‘You naturally don't make me say no,' Brynjulf laughs, adding, ‘Since we're now also chasing stray birds, I guess we need to go more broadly.'
But certainly the Southeast is special when it comes to bird life.
“ This area is like a funnel into the country from Europe, and then the birds are scattered from here.
Being here looking at migratory birds and stray birds is very interesting, but here is less to be found of warblers than in many other parts of the country.
It is not far from a spring and to a glacier, so the area as such is suitable for the observation of birds."
But does Brynjulf have a favorite bird?
He thinks for a short while before answering.
The question is difficult.
‘Beep nose is my bird because I've found nine of the ten people that have been seen on the land,' he answers at last.
“ I think it’s one of the most fun to take pictures of horseshoes.
So it's always fun to find birds that haven't been seen before in this country or are rare, so I don't now talk about finding a new species for Europe."
But that's what Binni and Björss both of them have done.
If you want to monitor Binna and Bright's work more closely at the Southeastern Bird Observatory, you can watch their work on Facebook and on the Birds website.
Saudi Arabia – Solar Beach of the Future? no alcohol or bikini
The tourism industry has grown hugely in many parts of the world in recent years, and now Saudi Arabia authorities want their share of the cake.
Consider the government spending about $60,000 billion to create a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reports on this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that we Icelanders are supposed to get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available and women will not be allowed to sun up in bikinis.
But how, then, should tourists be lured to this strictly religious Islamic country?
This is to be done, for example, by building a new city that will be white beaches, moons (consciously made by humans), drag rental cars, and robots that serve people.
The Guardian says it is Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to put into this investment.
Of course, the money will be picked up in the country’s oil wealth.
The Crown Prince says that it is not under discussion that women can let go of covering shoulders and knees in public places but at the same time admits that creating a tourist paradise in the country is not a simple matter because it is too hot there when the sun is high in the air and cannot be relied on for wind chill.
However, it may be wondered if the interest of future tourists is also diminished if they are unable to buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, previously overthrown by the Central African Republic's Presidency, announces presidential bid
Former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been overthrown, announced Saturday that he would run for president in the December presidential election despite the United Nations taking sanctions and that an arrest warrant was issued for his alleged crimes against humanity.
He announced his representation in a speech before a large group of supporters in the parliament of his party, Kwa na Kwa ("work, only work"), in the capital city of Bangui.
This 73-year-old former general and military governor was removed from power in 2013 during an insurrection by a coalition of mostly Muslim rebels from the north that plunged the nation, which is majority Christian, into a violent civil war and a serious and long-standing humanitarian crisis.
"The country needs a man with experience, peace and conviction," Bozize said in a speech critical of the current president's term of office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took power after a coup d'état in 2003 and served as president for 10 years before fleeing the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against humanity and for inciting genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile in late last year.
It is not clear how the arrest warrant or foreign sanctions affect his representation.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to repeal the sanctions imposed in 2014 due to alleged support for the armed Christian groups of Anti-balaka.
Touadera currently directs the country with the support of an extensive UN peacekeeping force numbering more than 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to run for a second term, but his run has not been confirmed.
The first round of the election will be on December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups that usually claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crime has declined but there are still bloody incidents that are usually caused by conflict over resources, but the majority of this diamond-rich country is not dominated by the government.
The violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Gareth Bale's position at Real Madrid is 'unacceptable for everyone' says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, Real Madrid's midfielder, says Gareth Bale's position with the Spanish team is "unacceptable for everyone".
Bale did not participate in any of the team's last seven games, and he took little part in Los Blancos' LaLiga celebration, and now this summer has come up with the podium that the player plans to stay and let his contract expire, but the club hopes he will disappear on track.
"There is no way to avoid the situation becoming unacceptable for everyone," said Kroos in the Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport.
“ He was not bought to play him as little as he is now.
I think in fact he wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company actually said 'yes' but so said 'no' later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about it.
When asked if the circumstances had negatively affected Real's atmosphere, Kroos said: “Not as much as you would expect.
I've known him for six years and we've worked some important things together."
The Chinese give Smokynestown 2,000 face masks in support of the battle with the coronavirus
The Chinese ambassador, Jin Zhijian, handed over two thousand face masks to the Mayor of Smokyanestown over the past week.
The occasion was the visit of the mayor to the Chinese embassy on 22 July last
Vicar News first reported.
The point of the Mayor's visit was to repay the Chinese ambassador's visit to Smokyanestown, where he visited the City Hall and met with the Mayor.
Tells Vicar News that there was talk of promoting a friendly town partnership between Smokyanestown and Xianyang City, but the local communities started a partnership between each other in 2014.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, stems from this friendly town partnership, but city authorities in Xianyang wanted to give masks, thus supporting the battle with the coronavirus pandemic.
Says in a report by the Vicar News that the masks will be used in the vulnerable institutions and Smokyanes town centres for both employees and other visitors who arrive there.
The accompanying photo shows in addition to the flag of Iceland and the People's Republic of China, an inscription on the face mask box stating "Ber is each behind, unless there is a brother without."
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Expects reduction to salary
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from Iceland champions KR, next month and says he feels interest from partners in the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017, becoming champion of both Val and KR.
However, this 27-year-old parishioner says he starts to miss Denmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania Jakobsdóttir.
Danan's contract with KR is valid until the end of this season so it is clear that a Danish partnership would have to negotiate with KR for purchase price to get him in August, before a new season starts in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would have to wait until this winter to reach Denmark.
“ Yes, I know that the Danish leagues start again at the end of August.
That means, of course, that I would have to terminate my contract with the KRs but I have told them that I miss Denmark, and they have a full understanding of it," said Thomsen to the bull.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with Coach Runar Kristinsson, who had shown full understanding of the situation, and Thomsen said he did not believe the purchase price would be a major problem.
“ I have also had conversations with two 1st Division clubs after that league was running out and the teams knew where they would end up.
There has been a bit of interest already regarding the upcoming season so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic league stops," said Thomsen but added that it was clear that there were not many partnerships in Denmark that could buy up his contract with KR.
“ This is not quite clear now, but it has been an interest.
I also need to find the best chance for myself and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and is coming with me.
This depends on several things," said Thomsen and claimed to look primarily at Copenhagen.
Thomsen said KR-inga didn't have to worry that he didn't give himself all in practice and games, although he missed Denmark.
“ KR knows what it gets from me, and that is that I do things 100 percent.
I can quite overlook the fact that I miss Denmark when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who says it is clear that he will lower his salary in leaving the Island champions in Denmark's second division.
“ I’m probably going to have to cut back a little, because of the coronavirus crisis that seems to have spawned the Danish associations a little more than the Icelandic one.
But I am also studying, and one solution might be that a society provided me with a job.
Most of the partnerships in the 1st Division are yes with an agreement with sponsors.
I am studying sports management through the player organization and am completing the Bachelor's degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been part of KR's starting team in two games in the Pepsi Max League during this season, but was involved in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the team last year, scoring seven goals.
KR is equal to Val to points at the top of the Pepsi Max division and has a game for good, but the team meets KA at the Academy today.
Fighting the coronavirus aboard a bus as a driver gets into a hot argument about face masks
The video shows passengers and drivers aboard an Arriva Street bus in Liverpool addressing mask use.
The driver is heard explaining to a woman that it is not his job to tell passengers to wear a mask.
The driver said, "It's not my job to tell everyone who gets into the carriage to wear a mask."
A witness said this about the incident: "A man and an older woman started to get at her and a big argument broke out."
"The driver had to get out of his seat and came to ask what was really going on and he told one woman that she wasn't even wearing the mask right."
"That woman then ran away from the wagon and said she was going to report the incident."
A spokesman for Arriva said: “The security of our customers and our employees remains our top priority.
"Our customers are required to wear masks as they use public transport (exceptionally applicable)."
"Exploring instructions and markings for customers regarding this and all other distance rules are aboard buses, on social media, and on our website."
Masquerade has been in effect in public transport since June 15.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been identified globally.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the global coronavirus.
Most cases of COVID-19 have been identified in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to hire people with disabilities more often in roles
The actress is involved in a new effort for increased participation of people with disabilities in the recreational sector.
The effort is underway at the same time as 30 years have passed since the passage of the U.S. law on the rights of people with disabilities, which carries up on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer discusses the importance of people seeing themselves and their lives reflected in a realistic way on the screen.
‘Nothing can replace personal experience and genuine manifestations,' she says.
"That's why it's so important to recruit relevant actors into the appropriate roles."
Spencer discussed the effects she experienced from seeing skin-dark people on the screen when she was a little girl watching the episode "Good Times".
These, which were shown on CBS between 1974 and 1979, were created by Norman Lear, and they paved the way as the first comedy shows to feature two parents both of African descent.
Organizations Against Hunger push Yoho aside after incidents in the House of Assembly
WASHINGTON (AP) – An independent Christian organization that wants to end hunger said Saturday that they had asked Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the organization's board of directors, and that he had been caught up with it, after what they called a "attack" on Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democratic congressman, accused Yoho, a Republican congressman in Florida, of using low-level and malevolent defamation as he rebuked her when they met on the steps of the House of Assembly last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the wording had been as she described it.
Broad for the World said in a statement that the organization's board of directors had met with Yoho on Friday, seeking that he resign in order "to right our commitment to stand by women and skin-dark people, domestically and globally, who lead us toward a world with increased participation of all races and increased justice."
The Broad for the World website says their "consisting voice" pressured Congress and government to end hunger in the country and globally.
"Since Broad for the World is independent of Christian organizations whose aim is to reduce hunger and poverty through solid public policies, the organization upholds the respect, dignity and care that Jesus asks us to show when dealing with people in positions of power, wherever they are on the political spectrum," the statement says.
"In our view, the recent activities and words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the press, do not reflect the moral requirements made to our board members."
In the process of the news, Yoho's spokesman had not responded to an email with an invitation to respond.
In an amazing speech in the House of Commons last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez said in a dramatic manner about the incident and directed her words against what she called a male-led culture that "consistes of violence and violent language against women".
More than a dozen of her colleagues commented that the incident was an example of far too common male behavior.
Yoho described the incident as brief discussions about policy issues and that "no one had been bothered, bullied or attacked".
He said he regretted showing a "hot interface".
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in her first season as a Progressive Senator and she has received both praise and vice for her cleanliness.
The 65-year-old Yoho is one of the most conservative members of the House of Representatives, and he will retire at the end of his fourth term.
Waiting until the 98th minute of the final game with scoring the first goal of the season
Jesse Lingard had not scored nor committed to the English Premier League in this season, until he scored against Leicester today in the 98th minute of the league's final round.
Lingard had not scored in the English Premier League since scoring twice against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came on as a substitute today for Manchester United when the team faced Leicester in a Champions League match.
With over seven minutes past normal playing time, Lingard punted the ball off Leicester's goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and scored on the empty goal.
Jesse Lingard's long-awaited goal.
Players Real Madrid exempt from quarantine rules
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to attend England in their second match with Manchester City, in the European Championship, without having to go on a two-week quarantine.
The British government has decided that tourists from Spain need to go into two weeks of quarantine, in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
However, there are exceptions, as in the case of competitive teams at the highest level of sport.
This confirmed the Department of Sports at Sky Sports.
The Ministry says that those individuals who are exempt from the rules will only be in designated areas, to closed doors.
This applies to sports stars, judges, coaches, medical teams, and media professionals.
The Madriders can therefore face Manchester City on 7 August without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2–1 under in the final after losing at Santiago Bernabeu on 26 February.
The winning team will advance to 8—the finals taking place in Portugal.
Rainfall and depression over the land during the tradesmen's weekend
From reports of overcrowded hotels and campgrounds judging, in the least south, it is clear that the Islanders have been hard-working inland travel this summer.
At the same time, those who have made landfall have been with firm luck with the weather and weather considerations of DV's sources agreeing that summer was just being told excellently, so far at least.
But now it is time for a tradesman's weekend, which has so far been the biggest travel weekend of the year.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared to other weekends, since there are now events that in the regular year have drawn large numbers of people not to be held.
It is sufficient, for example, to include a national festival.
The weather will then, of course, play a major role, but now there is a look for torrential rain throughout the country, but especially south and southwest to.
The National Weather Service predicts torrential rain from Thursday night and at least until Saturday night.
It should be noted that long-term forecasts are not sacred truth here on the north side of the Atlantic Ocean and may probably change.
The meteorologist, Einar Sveinbjörnsson, says in his prediction on his weather web, Bliku, that the traders weekend is expected to be low.
He says: A low draught in the sky with associated cold that too often also extends down to the surface, leads to the fact that when warmer air from the southwest tries to approach, just a depression is produced by wind and rainfall.
Of course, the warmer air that 'fools' here north over.
In support of its forecast, Einar explains: “A small wave from America travels to the east with summer warm air.
As it approaches, it reaches 'flowering' in the form of descending atmospheric pressure and a considered summer depression."
The large forecast illustration, the European Calculation Center on the left of the map, and the U.S. GFS forecast on the right are quite parallel with this trend.
The recovery of the depression will go according to the forecast over late Thursday and early Friday with sharp A-roads and rain on most of the country.
The low center of about 985 hPa then follows.
This time, some warm air in the North and East follows Saturday and even Sunday as well.
On the other hand, it could be blown along.
A man was seriously injured when an automobile carrying cattle rolled in Wexford
A man was seriously injured in a road accident earlier today at the Ferrycarrig Bridge in Wexford.
A cattle truck channeled to the bridge and rolled over to a manless stationary car.
The 34-year-old driver suffered serious injuries in the accident, which occurred at around 13:50 today.
He was taken to Wexford Hospital, where he lies heavily held.
The police technical unit is investigating the scene and the bridge has been closed and bypasses have been raised.
A lot of cattle were killed in the collision.

Chasing an actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
"I had a crush on her as you get this kind of childhood crush," says Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, lead actress of the Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so rocked by the actress that she showed up at the show's set and waited for her for hours, just to be able to say hi.
When Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir, owner of the travel agency Pink Iceland, looked like many Islanders at the thriller Law and Order: Special Victims Unit up from the turn of the century, she coalesced for the main actress of the show Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her and the actress' meetings on the show Love Stories on Channel 1.
When Birna herself was a teenager, at the age many people begin to develop violent love shots, she did not experience it like her peers because she stood in the strictness of suppressing her own feelings.
She pretended to be interested in boy bands and young stalled heartmakers from movies but did not have it at all.
“ I was cutting pop sheets and hanging pictures on a wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that it is sometimes mentioned that when people come out of the closet, they go through a late puberty phase.
“ We spend our teenage years suppressing these teenage impulses, these shots, and things like that.
I think it was one of the things that attracted me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm and I just had a crush on her."
It ran onto the string of the actress when she was in New York a few years ago.
One of her best friends, Erling Fear Thoroddsen, was shooting a film in that city, prompting Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga Guðjónsson, to assist in the filming.
“ We were working on a 30-man camera crew and spending a while with strangers.
It's naturally an inclusive atmosphere when you spend so long together a day so it was talked about everything and nothing."
One day, there is talk that Birna is a big fan of Mariska.
One woman on the camera team says her friend recognizes the actress because he was on the show's camera team.
Unable to stop thinking about that fact, Birna regularly asks her new friend how her friend likes working with the actress and whether Birna can get to see her.
"She tells me to stop it, she doesn't know if she can make it happen," says Birna.
When the film is finally finished, the group toasts and Birna tries for the last time to convince the woman to try to arrange the meeting.
‘She had had a few drinks and said she would just fix it.'
A few days later, Birna sends a message to the woman asking if anything is going on.
The woman does not answer, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she then wakes up to a long-awaited message.
“ I look at the phone and scream at myself.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up with the screams and I say, "I have to take a shower and I have to do fine and go downtown."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors and the film crew of Law and Order were in a hotel in Times Square.
‘I don't know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, good luck,' stands in the message, and Birna wears herself in a flashback, asking in the reception where the filming takes place and picks up the elevator to the 45th floor where the group is gathered.
Birna settles down and waits until a woman on the staff comes to her and asks this unannounced woman if they can assist.
"I say I'm looking for Jason and I asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived."
When the friend finally arrives, he looks amazed at Birna and asks how on earth she got all the way to the set end there was supposed to be strict security.
Birna explains that she has now just taken the elevator and asks to see Mariska.
“ Yes, I don’t know.
Sit down here," says the friend and Birnah.
Along her side sits an extra in the episode, and they begin to chat.
‘I say to him, ‘I'm a fan, but you?' says Birna.
"I played this as if it was the most natural thing in the world."
Time passes, and Birna waits.
The actors perform regularly when a pause is made, they get a snack, and Birnah looks around and searches for Mariska who is nowhere visible.
Finally, the friend arrives and tells her that he is sadly leaving.
Birna asks him to get into the hands of another employee, as she did not think of going anywhere immediately.
Wondering, the friend agrees and reaches out to another employee.
‘He brings another friend and says, ‘This is the woman from Iceland who wants to see Mariska.'
Then he goes.
Finally after two hours of waiting, the new friend comes running to Birna.
“ He says: ‘ Hurry!
These are unusual situations today, there are journalists with her so she will stop nothing.
She's going the straightest way in a car with them, so you have to take the chance and go downstairs and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
‘So I look to the right and lose my face' Birn veines off and takes the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds about forty trailers, some marked and some not.
However, Mariska's trailer does not find her, and then despair begins to be crouched.
“ I feel overwhelmed because I had spent half a day on this, but I think so well, I tried.
That was fun."
Vondauf holds Birna back towards the hotel, where she sees through the window the camera crew looking at themselves with pity eyes, realizing that Birna was unable to perform her mission.
Birna accepts fate, and it begins to rain.
“ I go under a veil to cover myself from the rain.
Then I look right and I lose my face."
None other than Mariska Hargitay stood there in the pantstack she wears in the episode, and Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly move with mood.
“ I look at my body and my hands and now I think you have to move.
Now you have to go towards her."
Birna does so and dares herself up in picketing the actress' shoulder.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I just say hello and say hello," recalls Birna.
“ I say I’m from Iceland and I’m a big fan.
She says, "It's nice to meet you."
The conversation didn't get much further, because Mariska's car has arrived and she's being whistled.
Mariska turns to Birna and says, 'I have to go but it was really nice to meet you.'
Birna says goodbye to the idol, watches the car drive away and then breaks up.
“ I’m calling Erling and Gunna, and they thought it wasn’t possible.
But I was crying for excitement and joy.
I say, yes, I'll meet her.
Then we bowled in soda water and tequila," says Birna.
She does not regret anything, though she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ It's like this once in a lifetime, sacrificing time and energy like this in making this happen.
But I will always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen discussed with Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir on the show Love Stories on Channel 1.
Police won't spread the virus
There is no reason to worry that the coronavirus may be transmitted by alcohol gauges used by police.
This is what a police officer in the police traffic department in the capital area says in a conversation with
Tips have been received from people concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when police move in, settle on a traffic street, and make everyone passing by blow.
Police say that they are clean, though they are safe.
‘It's not really special mouthpieces but we're recommending a trophy that people blow into,' says a police officer.
"Some people want to put their lips to this but we guide people to keep a little distance, to a few dozen centimeters."
Asked if it's enough distance, a police officer says so.
Try to show positive, then the police use a different measure.
He has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
Abdominal distension: Among other things, ingest anis to reduce pain
The connection to depression is not a coincidence.
Individuals who suffer from inflammatory bowel disease, a disease characterized by abdominal pain, seizures, themedness, flatulence, constipation, and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which can lead to worsening of symptoms according to the United States Anxiety and Depression Association (ADAA).
"This is because the colon is partially controlled by the nervous system, which responds to stress", the ADAA explains.
In the absence of a reduction in the thickness, there may be food intolerance.
A judge tries to stop a ruling that children will be released from immigration authorities
In his ruling on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee invalidated the expected deadline by saying that immigration and customs authorities in the United States do not need to release children if this cannot be done by any of the three routes described in her previous decree.
However, Gee also stressed in his decree that immigration and customs authorities still have an obligation to release the children without unnecessary delay.
The three routes that Gee specified are to release families detained by immigration and customs authorities together, to place children in the hands of a responsible person, or to release families on a federal court order.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of the Proyecto Dilley Institute which provides legal services to families detained, condemned the decision and said it puts it into the hands of immigration and customs authorities to decide whether children should continue to be detained.
"The main point is that children are kept captive untimely and they don't get out unless immigration and customs authorities approve of it or families agree to be stoked apart," said Fluharty.
Families are held at three locations of immigration and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley), and Karnes County, Texas.
The children in these locations are between the ages of 1 and 17 according to lawyers and representatives who provide legal assistance.
Gee, who oversees the implementation of the Flores Agreement on the Care of Children in Keep, said in June that since "the rules of mask use and social distance were not or poorly followed", it was imperative to transfer children from these centers of work.
969 people detained by immigration and customs authorities have been identified with the coronavirus and are in isolation or surveillance as of 23 July, according to immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 are confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley and two in detention centers for families.
A total of more than 3,700 cases have been confirmed in custody.
Will look at governmental independence legislation
The Prime Minister does not say unnaturally that pension funds set standards in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
The Banker's comments that the independence of the board of trustees of pension funds, possibly by law, will be taken into consideration.
After Icelandair broke off talks with the Icelandic Aviation Association and resigned from all flight attendants, the VR board of directors appointed by VR to the Board of Trustees of the Life Fund of Traders filed a format or voted against the participation of the pension fund in Icelandair's upcoming equity tender.
Ragnar Þór Flolfsson, chairman of VR, went on to say that managers would be replaced if they did not comply with the recommendations.
Ragnar Thor withdrew his statement three days later, as did the VR government.
Ásgeir Jonsson, a banker said in the news ROV on Friday that the independence of the directors of pension funds had to be guaranteed in the funds' approvals and possibly by a change in law.
Prime Minister Catherine Jakob's daughter says it is important that the directors of pension funds are independent but already believe it is guaranteed by law.
"Now, of course, a banker who conducts the Treasury which has to do with this has said that the regulatory framework around this independence needs to be specifically examined, we will take it for consideration if anything has to be reviewed there," she says.
Kathrin says that law under should pension funds set moral norms in their investment policy.
It is preferable to discuss the social and moral norms they wish to highlight in their investments.
“ I didn’t feel that it was abnormal that pension funds also set standards in their investment policy on working people’s rights.
But I think it is natural that such decisions are made through policy and not through individual investment decisions," says Catherine.
‘Insufferable traffic jams at Elf River Bridge,' says President of the Township of Årburg
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the Årborg Town Council says traffic congestion, formed by the Elf River Bridge on Selfassi daily is completely intolerable.
He hopes that tenders due to a new bridge over the Elf River will take place in the fall.
Now that the Islanders are travelling through their country and there is heavy traffic on the country's highways, a daily traffic jam is created at the Elf River Bridge when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the township.
Long rows form at the edge and can address the patience of the drivers waiting in a row.
“ Yeah, it's totally intolerable, it's one traffic jam here and not just on Fridays because it's just become on active days too.
There are long queues, sometimes quite uphill on the Hellsheath for those who want to get by here on their way eastbound and those who are coming west, so it gives an eye that we need to get a new bridge and no later than yesterday's preferred," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the township in Årborg.
The weekend says that local authorities in Årborg recently met with the head of the Roads Agency and the designer of the Roads Agency, and that meeting was very positive.
"If you've ever been optimistic that there's work being done on these issues, I think I can say that now because there's really work on this and we're supposed to be able to see that a new bridge is going to be offered out in the fall."
But is there any holy advice to the drivers in the queue at the Elf River Bridge every day during the summer?
"Yes, that the strait can be passed and through the earldom, it speeds up but those who are going east, they cannot be pointed to go the Lyngdal heath but those who are going into the uphills should use the Moscow, Parliament and Lyngdal heath".
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the Årborg Local Government, who says the traffic jam, formed by the Elf River Bridge at Selfoss is intolerable.
Long queues form each day at the Elf River Bridge, often requiring drivers to wait a considerable amount of time to cross the bridge.
Then the only advice is to take a deep breath and think something positive.
The future of the home of the Coal Bears in northern Brisbane is subject to organizational judgment
The municipality said that, in addition to the area being a vital home to Coal Bears, suspended squirrels, and the grey container hawk, it was an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Executives have appealed the municipality's rejection to the Court of Planning and Environment arguing that the structure is in accordance with the Municipal Planning Act of 2014, would meet the organizational and community needs that have not been met to date and "could be carried out without unacceptable influence".
There is strong opposition to these planned projects in the near environment.
The executives argue that even though the proposal is fully in line with the organization, it could be changed if it does not meet requirements, rather than rejected.
At present, the project includes many stages, including a service station, childcare, and 39 residences.
Public submissions were more than 120 in consultation time, and most of them objected to the proposal as it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The minority leader of the Brisbane City Council said that the city needs to buy the land to protect the koala bears.
"[The mayor] Adrian Schrinner needs to stop wasting taxpayers' funds in a fight with executives before court and buy this land to protect Brisbane's natural and wildlife," City Councillor Cassidy said.
"These are one of the most important homes of coal bears in the Mountain to Mangroves natural area, and there are a number of coal bears."
Schrinner said this week that the municipality wanted the home of Coal Bears in the area to be protected.
"We felt the proposal was not suitable for the area," Schrinner said.
"I understand that this is now going through the judicial system and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will cause the home to be preserved."
Schrinner said that mapping of the home of koal bears is the shared responsibility of the municipal government and government, but that the government was responsible for accurate maps over the home of koal bears supported by local authorities when they take applications for operations for treatment.
Solskjær: Next step is to win something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, coached by Man Utd, was hoping a camping finish with the team securing third place in the English Premier League today.
The team will therefore play in the European Championship next season.
United needed a draw or victory against Leicester today, and the result was a 2–0 win by the Red Devils.
“ The players had an excellent feat of taking third place, based on the situation in the season.
I think that we slaloms may have got over a spiritual slalom by winning such a big game, as we've lost twice in the playoffs in this season.
We knew we needed a playoff today, now we can start the next chapter that's with these boys winning titles," said Solskjær the winning referee.
Manchester United still have a chance to win a title this season, but the team play in the European League in August and are as good as 8—a team there.
Armistice begins at midnight in war-raised Eastern Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine – The Ukrainian army and opposition forces in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a "complete" ceasefire to begin at midnight and as representatives hope to be able to be the first step towards peace after 6 years of conflict.
Representatives of opposition forces said on Sunday that they had instructed their soldiers on a ceasefire and issued a decree banning the use of weapons.
The Ukrainian military said its forces had "had preparations" for the ceasefire.
If it succeeds, it would "pay the way for the implementation of other provisions" of the Minsk Peace Agreement according to a statement by the Office of the President of Ukraine earlier this week in which the ceasefire was called a breakthrough step.
The goal of the Minsk Peace Convention, made in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and separatists that enjoy the help of Russia, which started in 2014 after Russia's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and the country's support for separatists.
More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict.
Presidents of Russia and Ukraine both welcomed the ceasefire in a call on Sunday, stressing the importance of establishing the agreement reached at the December meeting in Paris.
Vladimir Putin, Russia's President, expressed concern about Kiev's call for the Minks Convention to be revised, saying that Volodimir Selensky's stance, the President of Ukraine, on the "invasion of the Minsk Convention, which he once again expressed in this call, should be reflected in real action".
However, Selenkij stressed the need to take "further measures" to free the Ukrainians who are prisoners of the rebels in Eastern Ukraine, in the annexed Crimea and in Russia, according to a statement from the President's office.
Under the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only gain control of borders with Russia in the areas occupied by separatists once they have obtained a broad right of self-government and when elections have been held in the territories.
The rally reduced fighting, but Ukrainian forces and rebels have continued to exchange shots.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to have other talks, support for the Minsk Convention was expressed and agreed to restart the peace process.
Selenkij, who won the 2019 election with promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to gain control of the border before the first regional election, but the Kremlin government is demanding that the treaty be taken into action without change.
The new ceasefire agreement was reached on Wednesday by a three-way coalition, appointed representatives of Russia and Ukraine as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was welcomed by EU officials.
During the traditional Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis also mentioned the ceasefire, saying that trust had to be "reconstructed and laid the foundation for a very necessary and long-awaited reconciliation with the people".
Police: Man shot dead in Texas protests
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) – A man was shot dead in a Texas protest as he approached a car and the driver in the car fired his weapon, police said.
Katrina Ratliff, a police spokeswoman, told reporters early Sunday that the shooting occurred just before 22:00 a.m. local time at a protest in Austin.
The man was taken to a hospital, where he was later ruled dead.
The car had whistled, turned down a road and then speeded the trip towards protesters, witness Michael Capochiano told the Austin American-Statesman newspaper.
The man, who had a rifle on him, according to Capochiano, approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, Capochiano said.
Ratliff told reporters that early reports indicated that "the victim may have been carrying a rifle" and added that the suspect was in custody and was willing to cooperate with police.
According to news agencies, the group had gathered due to the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The protesters were streamed live on Facebook, and it was there to hear the whistle of the car and several shots fired.
Goal Soup in the first win of the Blika in July
Breeding won their first league victory since June 29, as the team docked the IA, 5—3, in the Men's Pepsi Max Division at the Copavog Field tonight.
In contrast, the Skaga lose their third consecutive game in the league.
After winning their first three games in the league, Breiðablik played five games without celebrating a win and the team had lost three in a row before the match with the IA tonight.
So it was enough or killed for Blikas who met with great force into the game.
Alexander Helgi Sigurdarson put the team in the lead with a nice suspension in the 11th minute after Christian Steindorsson had sent him through the IA's defence.
Six minutes later, a Christian then doubled the lead after a particularly fine preparation by the GI son of Eyjolf from the left.
The Scythians did not make it to lands or shore in the first half, as the local high press made them massively difficult for connecting deliveries.
Bliks had all the power on the field and plotted the third goal in the 36th minute when Dann Thomas Mikkelsen hit in the corner kick of Hölgur's son Gunnlaug.
Then Christian Steindorsson scored his second goal and Blika's fourth goal just three minutes later.
However, the history of the first half did not end there.
The Skagas were given a glimmer of hope for the second when Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored from a penalty shortly before a break of play, but Kwame Quee had then broken clumsyly on Viktor Jónsson within the tenure of Blika.
Thus, 4–1 was the position for Breiðablik when the half-time whistle galled.
Only three minutes had passed by the second half when the Skaga scored again.
Hlynur Sævar Jónsson was then alone and unheld on Blika's goalie, easily guiding the ball into the net after Tryggva Hrafn's son Harald's corner kick.
However, Warms became a offender within the tenure of the IA just three minutes later when he broke at Alexander Helga.
A Vita kick was judged, and Thomas Mikkelsen scored by a safety to get Broadfield 5–2 over when just seven minutes of the second half had passed.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's goal, the Skaga scored again.
Anton Arisson, Blika's goalkeeper, then hit under pressure from Viktor Jónsson, gave the ball in Viktor's leg from where the ball turned down in the net.
Amazing 5—3 position faced as less than ten minutes had passed from the second half but this slowed the score as a result.
Despite both teams' fine opportunities to add boundaries, including Kwame Quee's two deadlocks from the Broadside side, they did not become more and a 5–3 win for the Broadside Finals of the game.
Breeding thus won their first victory in less than a month, beginning on 29 June, and is passed after the win by 14 points in third place, two points from Val who is a place above and three from KR's top team.
However, KR and Valur both have a game inside the Blika.
The IA has to settle for the third consecutive loss in the league, while the team has ten points in eighth place, five points from drop place.
Despite remarks made by the White House, the Wraith Corps is not in danger.
The producers of the Puppy Squad righted yesterday that there was no standing to stop showing the baby material in the near future.
The statement comes in the wake of remarks made by Kayleigh McEnany, a White House media agent, that the show, which deals with, among other things, law enforcement dogs, was a victim of "outdoor culture".
Canadian producers of the show were quick to respond to McEnany's words and released that their fans did not need to worry about the future of the Puppy Squad.
Several television series covering the work of police have been removed from a show in the United States recently following a protest wave against police brutality.
However, the Puppy Squad is not included despite the fact that it carried out rumors on social media.
At a press conference in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that U.S. President Trump was opposed to "outdoor culture" and especially when it came to police.
The term refers to when comments or actions made by individuals or corporations evoke a harsh response on social media, and it is called for the person to be boycotted in protest.
“ We saw a few weeks ago that shows on the Puppy Squad, a children’s show about cops, were stopped.
Similarly, Cops and Live PD shows," said McEnany on Friday.
She then added that Danish toy manufacturer Lego took law enforcement kits out of sale, but there is no foot for that claim, according to the defenders of Lego.
However, it is true that the Cops and Live PD reality shows were recently taken from a show there west of the sea.
Both episodes include a controversial one for showing footage of actual police duties without being licensed by individuals appearing there.
Together for 29 years - Sometimes jealousy and suspicion arise
A Christian daughter of a family therapy scholar answers questions from readers on matters relating to the family, the children, and the love in the DV family corner.
This time, she answers to readers who have never been single.
We've been together since we were 15 years old, have been together 29 years, and have two children.
We know nothing but to be together and we feel good, but we have both felt like we are missing something.
We have never been with other human beings and have no comparison as to how this might be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust in relation to whether the other party is looking around, thinking about adultery, or even divorce, and changing.
When we discuss this, we agree to grow our relationship, but it's this kind of bruise that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thanks for a wonderful question, and I am glad that you have such open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings about your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking this one in either corner, you couldn't discuss this and even take some steps that you so later could regret.
Everything on the table, isn't it always the best?
A strong sense of identity has the greatest predictor of future happiness and the stronger self-esteem you possess, the more likely you will have a mate with a strong sense of identity.
The reason that relationships that start in adolescence do not always last all their lives, is often that people mature in either direction, but in cases where complementary effects occur, individuals can become a stronger whole than many others.
Since your relationship begins to develop in your greatest formative years, you can conclude that you have matured together and have a positive effect on each other's identity.
You see, we are shaped by the relationships we are in.
The way I speak, is shaped by the way you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relationships shape who we are.
Could you turn the example around and think: what do we have that others don't have?
What does this many years of specialization give us?
I allow myself to claim that the benefits can be quite a lot more than the flaws.
You have shaped each other for years, and as a result, you can be said to be customized about a millimeter to each other.
That is more than many people can say.
Worth it?
You talk about the fact that you have missed something, but it is important to remind yourself that major changes such as divorce and a new relationship are also accompanied by companion fish for which you are not necessarily excited.
You may be missing out on starting over, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and putting together families.
This involves new challenges, a different problem, and possibly something new and exciting.
But this is not only accompanied by a pink cloud and happiness, oh no, at your age this can become a dirty complex task, which can possibly never smudge as well as you have already made each other.
Is it worth it?
Or why not put the focus on what you can do to increase tension, unpredictability, and innovation in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on the shelf yet.
There's so much you can do to make this long relationship even deeper.
What efforts can you make in connection with that?
What do you need from your mate that you are not getting?
What can you give to your mate, whom you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Would you like to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today there is considerably more tolerance towards various forms of relationship, and couples are beginning to define their relationships in various ways, e.g. open relationship, multi-love, or decide to break up temporarily.
I'm not telling you what to do at all, since no expert in your solutions, but possibly it would ease this heavy fat that looms over you, if you face this and think in solutions.
What do you need so distrust and fear go away?
You've been together 29 years, that must mean you're capable of things together.
Take advantage of it as a strength and hold hands toward your release.
We encourage readers to send their questions and misgivings to Kristina in an email at: hyonabandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in the Family Corner, of course anonymously and in full confidence.
Lost the cup and smashed it
Despite the great experience that Branislav Ivanovic has of lifting cups and celebrating titles, he lost and broke an impressive trophy in cheer after becoming Russian Cup champion yesterday.
Ivanovic won numerous titles as a Chelsea player in 2008–2017, then went home to Russia, joining Zenit's ranks.
There he has now become Russia's champion two years in a row and yesterday the team secured the cup championship with a 1–0 win over Khimki, as the winning goal came from Artem Dzyuba's penalty shootout in the 84th minute.
The trophy in the Russian Cup is made of glass, and when Ivanovic, who is the captain of Zenit, he dropped the trophy into the ground so it broke, as can be seen.
Ivanovic and his companions did not let it go and continued the celebration until the night.
It's a war!
Coleen Rooney hires attorney Johnny Depp in the "Wagatha Christie" fight with Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against allegations of injury against Rebekah Vardy
After discussions between the footballers' spouses went awry, their acquaintances expect a dramatic settlement
Coleen Rooney has hired the star attorney in Johnny Depp's controversial injury case to defend himself in his so-called "Wagatha Christie" legal dispute with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday simulates that Rooney assigned David Sherborne to defend herself against allegations that she had had an injury against Vardy, with claims that personal information was leaked to the media by her closed Instagram access.
The news comes days after evidence was submitted to the Supreme Court, stating that Rebekah Vardy, who is married to offensive coordinator Jamie Vardy of the Leicester City football team, suffered physically and mentally after the claims of Coleen Rooney.
The paper states that five children the mother, who is 38 years old, "had severe panic attacks and panic attacks so she was afraid to leave the house" and that Vardy, then seven months pregnant, "has been hospitalized three times ... because of a panic attack attributed to the entry and its consequences".
In addition to being Depp's attorney in his injury case against The Sun, due to claims that the actor beat his wife, Sherborne, 50, goes with the case of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their private case against the Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After negotiations between the two football wives failed, those familiar with dramatic settlements expect in the courtroom.
"If you felt the Depp trial was a spectacle, don't underestimate the expected war of the football wives," a source said.
Coleen doesn't give up, neither does Becky.
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone using Rebekah Vardy's Instagram access had leaked fabricated stories about her to a newspaper.
She was dubbed "Wagatha Christie" after realizing how she spent five months gradually limiting the number of friends who could see updates on Instagram stories by her, until only Vardy's account remained.
Coleen then claims to have posted a false story on Instagram, which would then have appeared in a gossip magazine.
In Vardy's case papers, which deny membership in the case, she argues that she was made a scapegoat after Rooney published the allegations "in a deliberate manner, with the aim of causing great harm and immense suffering".
Coleen's lawyers have questioned these words, saying that claims of her suffering are just presented to the media and distract from the facts of the case.

Biden's campaign team denies "Fox News Sunday" an interview one week after Chris Wallace's interview with Trump
In Trump's interview with Chris Wallace last week, U.S. President Trump doubted that the future Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, would handle the questioning flood that Wallace dropped on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question – at least not for now.
On Sunday, Wallace informed viewers that Biden's campaign team had told Fox News that he was "not free" for an interview.
"In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent in the Democratic party, Joe Biden, would plumb himself in a similar situation," Wallace said.
"This week, we asked Biden's campaign team for an interview and they said the former vice president was not free."
"We keep asking every week," he added.
Trump's campaign team has criticized Biden for months for avoiding election gatherings and press conferences while attending interviews during the coronavirus pandemic.
Although Biden has recently resumed his campaign trip, Trump and his associates have continued to mock the former vice president for "feeling themselves" at his home in Delaware.
Biden's fiber to attend public events, however, has not entertained his presentation as the latest surveys show that Biden has a good advantage over Trump both nationally and in major battle countries.
The RealClearPolitics averages indicate that the president was 7 percent below in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four states in 2016 as he turned them over to the Republican Party when he won the White House fight.
In the latest survey of the Fox News Poll, Biden has an advantage in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, outside the margin of error in all cases.
Surveys also indicate that Biden has a slight advantage in Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona, three other important struggling states in this election.
And surveys indicate that states that were once solid Republican strongholds, such as Texas and Georgia, are now divided between Trump and the former vice president.
Presidential elections in which a sitting president bids for a second term in the White House are often a vote for that president – and it appears to be the case now in 2020 in the fight between Trump and Bidens.
The most prolific issues have been the crown virus and the economy that is in decline due to the outbreak – and the performance and history of the president in both issues.
Kanye West and his wrestling bipolar disorder
The musician Kanye West today apologized to his wife, Kim Kardashian, for remarks he made in a manic episode.
The chairman of Psychiatry believes he is picking up his creative powers for the bipolar disorder, but a psychiatrist says it is important that people take medication to keep the disease under control.
The rapper Kanye West is not only one of the most original and influential musicians of the time, but he is no less famous as the husband of reality show star Kim Kardashian.
Much of his personal life has been openly carried out.
It came to great attention when he announced earlier this month that he was running for president in the United States, and gave an emotional and disparate speech.
Later, several distinctive pickets from him appeared on Twitter, claiming, among other things, that his wife was trying to have him hospitalized.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram asking people to show understanding to their husband and family; he had bipolar disorder, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he himself did not want to seek help.
He has since publicly apologized to her.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people develop bipolar disorder.
Ferdinand Jonsson is the chief medical officer of a London hospital psychiatric team, and knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause such extreme panics for the individuals and especially for the families and their loved ones.
This mania or mania can destroy relationships and work and cause an increasive amount of grief.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often extremely dangerous, because there's a high rate of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was nice that she said that.
And it's just human and human," Ferdinand says.
Häðinn Unnsteinsson, chairman of Psychohelp, has himself struggled with bipolar disorder — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very vibrant imagination.
If we are four-stringed earthen double basses, he is a hundred stringed heavenly harp.
And he's so overtly creative, overpowering, and smart in his powerful bonding thought, because you'll be around that bonding thought that we who've got to try to go into a manic state knows so well."
Kanye West doesn't want to take psychiatric drugs, because he believes they reduce his creativity.
He has covered the bipolar disorder, including on the album Ye.
Henn says it is his choice not to take medicine.
‘A lot of people think it staples this creative element that involves this unbridled bonding thought and the overtly creative force of the fire it has, but so are the natural flaws of it often great suffering, and the waves and dark cellars and darkness.'
However, Ferdinand says it is important for people with bipolar disorder to be treated.
“ If you have a lot of manic or manic, then you're not making great things, you're just on your side.
And like when people go into severe depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medicine?
‘Forever,' says Ferdinand.
"And especially working with someone to find the right doses and this way to balance the fact that the drugs help him the most, and destroy the least for him and his abilities and his creative powers."

Delhi Metro plunges the first pillar in the fourth stage of operation
The Delhi Metro reached an important milestone in the fourth stage of operations as the first pillar was paved for the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, which is being laid, according to staff on Sunday.
The chair was cast in Keshopur and on a raised section between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.
"Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) took another important step in the fourth stage of the operations as the first pillar at this stage of expansion of the train system was paved for the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg," said a statement by the DMRC.
This "important executive phase" was reached despite the severe lack of labor and other organizational challenges caused by the pandemic, according to employees.
The average height of the pillars along this route is 10 meters.
However, the pillars at 20 metres at Madhuban Chowk, where the route overlaps with route 1, and 25 metres at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the route meets route 2.
At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the bridge road becomes at 28 metres, the highest elevation in Dehli Metro's history according to the statement.
The highest point of the train system is currently at Dhaula Kuan, where bridge road route 7 reaches a height of 23.6 meters.
In the context of structural engineering, pillars are vertical stress-bearing structures that support the adjacent ends of two courses.
They form vertical structures that carry up the elevated bridgeway of the train system.
This train system pillar can be seen on the countless major tracks that run under the train system tracks in Delhi.
The numbers of the pillars now play an important role as a landmark for addresses in the Deli metropolitan area.
The 28.92 km long route from Janakpuri West to R K Ahsram Marg is an expansion of the Magenta route and on it there will be 22 stations.
21.18 km of the route will be raised and 7.74 km will be underground.
Construction on this section began in December last year.
On 17 July work began in the underground part of the route when construction of a crawl wall was started at Krishna Park Extension train station.
On 24 June, the DMRC began casting up a U-bearing bit which would later be placed in the raised section of the route.
In the fourth stage of the operations, 61,679 km of new train tracks will be laid for three different routes with 45 train stations.
These new parts will offer connections between the parts of the train system already operated by Delhi Metro.
Of these, 22.35 km will be underground, while other parts will be raised.

A 'vulnerable' ambassador wants a gun, an armored car, and a stab vest - said subordinates are ambassadors of the 'deep state'
Politically appointed U.S. Ambassador in this country, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is said to want to carry a firearm on him in a report of CBS news today.
Starting CBS's news story: "Despite being located in one of the world's safest states, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is 'friendly' about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavík last year."
Refers to CBS in 12 diplomats, diplomats, and former representatives as well as individuals familiar with the case.
Gunter's conclusion was to demand by the U.S. State Department that they request permission for the ambassador paranoid to walk around armed in this country.
He is also supposed to have requested an armored car that traveled him between locations in Iceland and stab vests.
The U.S. State Department refused to comment on whether there was any threat to the ambassador's security, however, representatives from the U.S. government said that the ambassador was expressed that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
However, it would have been advertised for bodyguards in Icelandic papers, says CBS, and is involved in complying with the ambassador's demands.
According to a CBS report, the Icelandic Foreign Ministry did not want to comment on the matter with CBS.
However, the U.S. news agency quotes its sources in this country as saying that there has been no request from the local government.
In addition, CBS says Gunter was talked about walking around armed as it would offend the host state, Iceland.
The ambassador received his rank as a reward for having richly supported Donald Trump's campaign fund in the 2016 presidential election.
Previously, he was a dermatologist in California.
Since taking over in May, Gunter is said to have created an "impossible" working environment at the embassy, and he has already had seven subordinates, known as the Deputy Chief of Mission, subordinates to the ambassador who are also sentencing diplomats.
It was all experienced diplomats from the U.S. State Department.
The first was sent off by the ambassador "because he didn't like his appearance."
Had already seen a year of preparation and had learned Icelandic.
The second lasted only six months.
As a result, a rooting was created by staff and the thought was to make Gunter try out as most until he thought of one of them.
Furthermore, CBS says that Gunter had been expecting embassy staff to walk the errands of the "deep state" and to have undermined him towards the State Department in Washington, D.C..
State Department officials in D.C. are said to be well aware of the situation at their embassy in Reykjavík, but have been hesitant to resort to the embassy's anarchy in light of Gunter's ties with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had trouble following the orders of the Washington State Department, and is said to have refused to return to D.C. during the Covid-19 pandemic.
He left the embassy in the hands of his staff for more months.
He is said to have intended to work from his home in California except ordered by the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Turned back at last
Having finally received the order, Gunter returned to Iceland in May.
His new subordinate, Michelle Yerkin, then arrived in the country this month.
CBS has not received answers to their inquiries to the U.S. State Department.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on CBS, nor on the DV's inquiry.
Gunter is one of the numerous politically appointed ambassadors to the Trump administration who have drawn attention to unusual behavior over the past few months.
To form, Woody Johnson provoked a harsh response when it came to the day that he was trying to have the British Open Championship golf to a golf course owned by Trump.
At the same time, the ambassador in South Africa has come under appeal for running his number two man and then attempting to appoint her son to the job.
42% of U.S. ambassadors are politically appointed.
30% were politically appointed in the Obama administration, and 32% in the George W. Bush government.
The protesters and police in Seattle in hair together over Trump's plans to send there Federal Bureau of Investigation forces
Seattle police used flare bombs and pepper spray on protesters who set fire to work trailers at a youth prison on Saturday, following a public anger wave over President Donald Trump's plans to send federal police forces into major cities.
Repeated mortars echoed through the streets of Seattle City, Washington, and smoke was received from the site where protesters had been carrying fire to trailers in a construction site at the youth prison.
The protestors cut car tires and broke windows in trailers.
Riot police campaigned against protesters, some of whom promoted umbrellas to ward off the pepper spray covers that rained on them.
The Seattle Times quotes police as saying 16 have been arrested on suspicion of assaulting police officers, for obstructing police duties, or for refusing to leave the area.
Poland will resign from European agreement to prevent violence against women
Poland's right-wing government says the country will withdraw from a European agreement to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul Agreement is the world's first binding lawmaker whose aim is to prevent violence against women, while Poland's justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as "bad", requiring schools to teach children about gender from a sociological point of view.
Ziobro said over the weekend that on Monday he would begin preparing for the formal process of the country resigning from the agreement.
"This ideological element relates to efforts to change education in schools and leisure work, in terms of the study, attitude and conviction of the young generation of Poles, based on the assumption that, in our view, is wrong, that biological gender is old-fashioned and that everything is really about social cultural gender."
Ziobro believes that the provisions of the Convention on the Education of Children and Young People as well as Family Relations in the context of LGBT people are unacceptable.
"We also reject the LGBT program in the discussion of family ties, because this is an opinion promoted by left-wing activists or groups of homosexuals who want their views to become binding laws," he said.
The European Council said on Sunday that it was "duggesting" over Poland's reluctance to disclose the agreement.
In Warsaw, Friday about 2,000 people protested, including groups of women and other groups of rights campaigners, outside the offices of the right-wing organization Ordo Luris, supporting the country's reporting on the deal.
"We won't be victims," they called.
Protests also took place in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Agreement to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, Engineer at the Palace of Honor, Dead at 81
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, who was part of a quarter mile race empire that includes his father Lee and his brother Richard, and who was the first engine builder to be admitted to the Palace of Honor Nascar, died Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family did not disclose his cause of death.
His funeral has not been announced.
While his other family members were romanized for their skills behind the steering wheel, Maurice Petty earned the nickname "The Boss" for his abilities with the wrench.
He helped his family win 198 races and seven titles in NASCAR's elite division, and also built engines that secured Honor Hallmate Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton the win.
"The director was one of the most skilled mechanics in NASCAR history," said the chairman and CEO Jim France.
“ He brought in the power that helped Petty Enterprises achieve his excellence in the field of sports.
Although known for his work under the hood, Maurice also performed various behind-the-scenes roles and did what it took to get his automobiles on the winning track."
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939 in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He accompanied his father to the racetrack when he was small, and his knowledge of mechanics soon became a vital part of lands Lee Petty's victory in 54 races and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR Cup in 1960–64, ranked seven times in the top five and 16 times in the top 10.
However, he soon decided to focus on what happens under the hood rather than behind the steering wheel, which proved to be a charm track for his older brother, who relied on his engines during his triumph.
Richard, then known as the "King", won the first championship along with the Governor in 1964 with a Plymouth car.
They won again in 1967, then two consecutive years in 1970 and 1971, obtaining three more titles before the end of the 1980s.
With these seven titles on their backs, they share the record in the most number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
"Maurice Petty was one of the true NASCAR pioneers and during his career at Petty Enterprises helped build one of the top teams in NASCAR," said Winston Kelley in a statement.
“ Although Petty's victories are recorded as 212, he claims well over 250 victories, if taken with all the machines he built for his competitors.
The controller will be remembered forever as one of the best motorists in NASCAR history."
Lee Petty died in 2000 and Patricia, wife of Maurice Petty until 52, died in 2014.
He was also a cousin of former driver and media personality Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, team manager in the pickup race.
"Although we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and effective pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his legacy and name will be kept in our memory, promoted and preserved throughout the future," Kelley said.
"We send our deepest condolences to the Petty family."

Pedro's sale from Chelsea confirmed and teammates say goodbye to him with a song in the locker room
Frank Lampard, Chelsea's manager, honored cantor Pedro Rodriguez after he played his last league game for the club on Sunday.
The 32-year-old player negotiated to temporarily extend his contract to finish the season with the club, but goes on free sale over to AS Roma upon completion.
The Spanish national team, who came from Barcelona in 2015, has been sidelined by Lampard in this season, because he has been in the senior squad only eight times and played a total of 21 matches in all competitions.
The West London team's manager blue confirmed Pedro's departure after the club secured a spot in the top four with a 2–0 win against Wolves, as the champion came in on off the bench to play his last game.
"Pedro has played their last game with the club," said Lampard to Sky Sports.
“ The boys hailed him in the locker room, and this is deserved when considering his career as a whole and with the company.
This was his last Premier League game, but he has made his mark thoroughly on the team.
I want to thank Pedro very much and wish him success in the meantime.
He will remain here for the remaining games, but with him departs a great player, and the social spirit I witnessed after the game was quite special.
Pedro published a farewell message after the game on his Twitter account, writing: "My last game at Stamford Bridge.
I want to thank every fan for the support over the years, the club for giving me the opportunity to wear blue, and my teammates.
You will always have a place in my heart.
Now let's go get the FA Cup!!!
STORA BLUE FAMILY."
Pedro, who previously played as a forward at Barcelona, now leaves Chelsea after being with the team since it won the title in 2017 under Antonio Conte, the FA Cup in 2018, as well as the European League a year later under Maurizio Sarri.
He earned another arrest.
A male was arrested for the second time in a short time this morning after refusing to leave the police station once he had been released.
The man was arrested last night due to drunk driving, and he was saved in a prison jail during the night.
When he was then released this morning, he refused to go away and, according to police, came back several times.
He did not obey the Italian orders of police to vacate and therefore "worked in" an ongoing stay with police, according to a diary of the police in the capital area.

Troops destroy army camps and destroy fighters in Zamfara State
Air strikes carried out by the air division of Operation HADARIN DAJI have destroyed a new camp of a combat group under the command of the so-called "Dangote" in the Doumborou forest area of Zamfara State.
Lieutenant-Colonel John Enenche and the Defence Representative said that the air strike, in which several numbers of fighters were also killed, had been carried out following HUMINT data gathering and numerous air patrol missions for confirmation.
Lieutenant Commander Enenche said that the intelligence data had revealed that members of the squadron had moved with supplies, motorcycles, and hundreds of stolen livestock from their previous residence to the new site through rocky mountainous areas inside the forest.
Enenche said that as a result, the air force had sent a specially reinforced squadron of fighter aircraft and armed helicopters from the Nigerian Army to attack the area.
He is quoted as saying: “The attack aircraft fired accurate shots at the area, killing some of the fighters.
Many others seen attempting to flee the area in the confusion were struck in further attacks."
As well as commending the air force of Operation HADARIN DAJI for its professionalism, the Air Force Commandant, Sadique Abubakar, urged the squadron to give up nowhere in aerial bombardment of combatants.
The council commander assigned them to continue their air operations as support for on-shore operations, in order to eradicate all combatants and restore calm to the north-west and central areas of the northern part of the country.

Serbia wants to increase the number of warplanes in ever-growing tensions in the Balkans
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its military and seek to buy more military aircraft as tensions increase in the Balkans, the president of Serbia said Sunday.
President Aleksandar Vucic said that "certain enquiry" was underway to purchase a fleet of fighters, and accused the United States and other Western states of having armed neighboring Serbia that is in NATO, as well as Kosovo, a former province of Serbia.
"The Americans, Turks and Germans take good care of their beloved offspring," Vucic said, referring to Kosovo.
He said that the United States had recently handed Kosovo security forces a number of armored cars.
During a tour of the Serbian Army's tank squadron, Vucic said his nation could not compete with the NATO's "money of contributions" to the neighboring armed forces and that "this is why we are up to ourselves".
Vucic did not specify what type of military aircraft Serbia was buying, but media loyal to the government says his government has officially requested the delivery of 20 attack aircraft from the United States.
It is stated that there has been no Washington response to the request from Belgrade, and that it will be rejected, it is likely that attack aircraft of the type Sukhoi-25 will be purchased from Russia.
Serbia, which asserts a policy of neutrality in military affairs, has recently been delivered to an advanced anti-aircraft system from Russia, which has also provided fighter jets, attack helicopters and armored vehicles.
China, which is also a coalition nation of Serbia, has handed over drags to the state for use in warfare.
U.S. officials have openly discussed bringing sanctions against Serbia if more weapons are received to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could put the security of nearby NATO member states at risk.
In the West and in neighboring states of Serbia, people look anxiously at the armed use of Russians and Chinese in Serbia.
Tensions are now rising in the Balkans, where there was a deadly civil war in the 1990s.
The Atlantic League interfered with Serbia to stop the bloody actions of the Serbs against the separatists of Kosovo Albania in 1999.
Despite formally seeking to join the European Union, Serbia's populist leadership has further strengthened its political and military ties with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, do not recognize Kosovo's independence, which the United States and most Western countries have recognized.
Heart attack: The likelihood of this fatal condition may be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that a specific treat could be good for the heart muscle.
And how could it reduce the chance of a heart attack?
Researchers have made a meta-analysis of coronary artery disease, which spans over five decades.
The main symptoms of coronary artery disease (also called ischaemic heart disease) are three: chest pain (angina), heart attack and heart failure.
Other signs and symptoms may include palpitations and severe shortness of breath.
"Sulfur contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoid, methylxantin, polyphenol and steric acid, which can reduce inflammation and raise good cholesterol."
A good cholesterol, also referred to as a high-density protein, collects "bad" cholesterol – a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart – and transports it into the liver.
The "slide" cholesterol (low density fat protein) is broken down in the liver, followed by removal from the body.
However, the new study does not explore the dose or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or other cocoa candy.
The results were based on an earlier study which concluded that the consumption of cocoa (which is found in chocolate) reduced the likelihood of a heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoid found in chocolate reduces blood pressure and improves vascular function.
A vascular function refers to how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients through the body and transports waste materials away.
No lifestyle factors were mentioned in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said of the data that those who had admitted to eating chocolate were more likely to have healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and feel less stress.
"Any of these factors could have an independent impact on cardiovascular health," she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys with books in a new collection campaign
"We've really listened and it was a complete key point in preparing a project", Ronson said.
"We do not believe that people want to recycle the books – we believe they will want to own them, but they can recycle them at home if they want to."
Ronson said the new promotional campaign was in progress long before COVID-19 came into existence, and despite the outbreak, she believes that the timing of the new campaign was "somewhat good" because of the amount of time parents now spend with their children.
Analysts have expressed concern that consumers have become tired of the ongoing toy collection campaigns of the largest supermarkets, but Ronson says there is no evidence of fatigue yet.
"We haven't seen any such thing yet, but we keep our eyes constantly open for this," she said.
“ We analyze a lot of data, from week to week, months to month, to make sure that what we give away finds harmony in our customers.
It was Cloes who paved the way for collecting campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, the first of which in mid-2018 was the driving force behind the supermarket's best quarterly sales since its inception.
Woolworths followed suit with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the supermarket to dramatically increase its sales, and now lastly the environmentally friendly promotional campaign Discovery Garden offers customers free plants and flowers for planting.
However, the new collection campaign could have less effect this time as UBS analysts predict increased sales by supermarkets in Australia during most of the 2021 financial year.
Ronson said customers can expect more diverse collection campaigns in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop will likely be less common.
"There's a lot of gathering presentation campaigns around the world that we look to and we constantly take inspiration from other countries", she said.
"We need to do it to make sure we do more and more with our customers."
It's been 5 laps around the country this summer.
The photographer and content producer Jon Ragnar Jónsson, often known as Jon From Iceland has been more and less flaking around Iceland since the pandemic.
Jon completed his undergraduate business studies at the University of Reykjavík a few years ago, but now works to travel and produce marketing materials for individuals and businesses.
Summer began at John's early home, or in April, when he made a trip throughout the West Coast and stayed in his car.
For the rest of a year, he has gone around five or six laps around the country.
In addition, he has made countless daily trips here and there.
What journey has stood out?
“ For someone like me who is always wandering around and who has seen everything, it’s hard to mention a favorite place.
It is more the weather and association that matters everything.
More recently, after the opening of those roads in June, high altitudes have gone high.
Those journeys always stand out because it's such an adventure to reach your destination.
The last trip there is possibly the favorite trip of the year, but then 25 together on 5 big cars went up by Riverside and from there to Lake Elf."
What lies ahead for you this summer?
“ I’m very excited, but I just finished my diving class with DIVE and now take diving trips around Iceland.
Then I was adding a surfboard to my 'dot box', so I'll be more into the sea than before.
I'm then heading for a 10-day 'solo' tour with everything I need my back, but it turns out later in the summer where I go.
Otherwise, I'll be a lot of high ground in the near future as that area cannot be viewed throughout the year."
What is your favorite place in Iceland?
“ I always find it hard to choose one place, but the Jackal River has been a part of my life ever since I remember.
Every summer, my family and I went to a residence at the foot of the Grand Bank, and since then, I have always been comfortable in that area.
I think it's safe to say I came there over 100 times."
With what place in Iceland do you recommend that people visit?
"I'm going to bring one pearl from each part of the country, but it's: Mule Canyon in the South, Support in the East, Aldey Falls in the North, Red Sand in the West, Snowfowl in the West, and Last but Not Late... Measuring the Highlands."
What is vital to the journey?
‘I don't go out to shore unless I have the following in the car: Good flashlights, hammocks, lopa sweaters, a hunting knife, an innubbing chip, a cooling box, and Æðurbits...those who know me know what I'm talking about.'
Searched for 24 rosers who are feared to have drowned off an island in Malaysia
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) – authorities in Malaysia said on Sunday that 25 rowing refugees who are feared to have drowned after jumping from a boat off the tourist island of Langkawi, which is north of Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a senior official with Malaysia's provincial security, said that the first information by police showed that only one of the 25 rowers who had jumped from the boat had managed to swim to land.
The man who survived sought help from police late Saturday and has been detained while the case is being investigated more closely, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim rowers have fled Myanmar for military action, and many of them live in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the population in Malaysia, which has been a frequent destination for boating parties promising better lives to refugees in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and an aerial vehicle were used during the search.
He said that the provincial security also remembers alerting sailors in the area and authorities in neighboring Thailand to allow them to assist in the search.
He did not provide any further information about the boat.
Last month, Malaysia authorities detained 269 rowing refugees and found bodies aboard a boat suspected of being used for smuggling off the coasts of Langkawi, but they claimed he was intentionally damaged so that he could not go back to sea.
Malaysia's provincial guard later said that the 269 individuals had been evacuated from a larger ship with dozens of people believed to have died and that their bodies were thrown into the sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia cannot accept any more rohing refugees as it struggles with economic depression due to the coronavirus pandemic.
However, he said that those already in the country will not be sent back to sea.
There are more than 2 million illegal immigrants living in Malaysia as well as about 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers – including 101,000 rowers – who are registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Residents in Aswan collect, patrol and deliver cargo of chocolate to Sudan by car roll
A transport vehicle en route to Sudan with many tons of chocolate rolled on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the junction of the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell into a coma due to a heat stroke.
The townspeople flocked to assist the driver as he was lying and saving the goods that had occupied.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, described his position as that the driver was “passing by our village; we could not just stand by.
We're supposed to help people in need, no matter where they come from."
He added that the villagers had come to an ambulance to pick up the driver and then attempted to save the cargo of the truck, valued at three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr said the villagers had been on the scene from morning to evening, saving as much of the cargo as they could.
"What we felt was the most important thing was to save the driver's life, protect the cargo and reopen the international road," he said.
The villagers were willing to provide water and shelter to the injured driver, Bahr said, and added that they just wanted to make sure he got to and from the village safe.
There were already violations in the Senate, and the coronavirus could make them worse.
"The pandemic alone is a call to our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we expect in times of difficulty," says a report drawn up from an interview series held by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communication education at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
"But we are also faced with other debt conditions centered on the genetic sin of our nation and the racial inequality that has plagued our country since its founding."
The study reviews familiar content issues related to the pathetic state of Congress: the lack of real links between parties, a program that limits opportunities for communication, the over-compression of power in leadership positions, the constant demands for the funds, the outcome of inter-group cooperation, the negative impact of media operated 24 hours a day, the fact that the most important elections for members of Congress are often pre-elections, and finally the silence of minor parties.
It is also warned that Congress will move more to cyberspace due to the pandemic as such a system, which allows elections with the help of replacements in the House of Representatives without the need for delegates to travel to Washington, could still add to the existing problems.
If the idea of a televised assembly reaches a foothold, it would be a serious setback for efforts to increase inter-category relations, according to the report.
"The pandemic because of this, Congress was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet and we certainly understand why," the report says.
‘But even though it was necessary, such things should not be interpreted as virtue.'
The document states that Congress needs "greater but not less communication between members of parliament, face to face".
They need to study one another's districts better, have polite conversations to find common facets and build relationships based on trusts that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
The call for courtesy was particularly appropriate this week, when Ted Yoho, a Republican congressman from Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic Senator from New York with arbitration and his Republican Party colleagues teamed up to attack Liz Cheney, a Republican congressman in Wyoming in hostile words.
Congresswoman Val Demings discusses the vice presidency, lets Trump hear it before the pardons
Congresswoman Val Demings (democrats, Florida) was not shy of discussing her interest in serving as vice president in the potential government of Joe Biden and expressing sincere appreciation for being taken into account for the office.
This distinguished member of the Congressional Group of Blacks was interviewed by BlackPressUSA live due to the #FIYAH! Live series and told of its story, effort and commitment that has brought it to the place it is today, starting with the words "You know all my story.I grew up as the daughter of a maid and a janitor in Jacksonville, Florida".
Demings was one of four U.S. House of Representatives in the trial of Donald Trump in the Senate in January.
Regardless of whether the Senate acquits Trump, it will be recorded in history that he is the fourth president to be charged.
In an interview with NPR by his office at Capitol Hill, this former Attorney General of the House of Representatives was quoted as saying, "Was this worth it? This has been worth every single day".
She added that despite the ruling having been disappointing, Democrats had been obliged to follow suit regardless of its outcome.
During the interview, Demings made clear that she opposes Trump's pardon on Roger Stone's prison sentence, which was convicted of lying before Congress (in addition to other crimes) as well as his pardon on other criminals convicted of similar crimes, when she said "The shamelessness of reaching out to your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover up your crimes".
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden's list of potential candidates for vice president, which also holds CBC chairman Karen Bass (democrats, California), Stacey Abrams former Georgia State Senators, Senators Kamala Harris (democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Cottons Mayor of Atlanta, Susan Rice's former U.S. Ambassador, and several others.
However, she stated that only one person would decide who presented themselves with Joe Biden in the fall.
‘It's Joe Biden.'
Then she moved her hand to her mouth while she laughed and pretended to whisper to those watching the live broadcast, and added "If you want to call ... then you may for my sake".
There is no doubt that regardless of each person's political views, in history books will be seen this period as a time when there was an evolution of American politics and attitudes.
This did not go unnoticed by Demings.
She mentioned that the number of women being considered for representation to the Vice President of the United States is an opportunity to break through the rest of the "glass ceiling" – especially for African women.
"It's exactly these opportunities that I work so hard that my whole life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don't have enough money or that they are of the wrong sex," she said.
The Congresswoman planned to ensure that the Democratic Party National Committee and Biden's campaign team would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many people to vote as possible.
"I will call Tom Perez (the chairman of the Democratic National Committee) and I will put this at the top of my list," promised Demings.
She agreed that this had to happen now rather than later in the campaign.
When she responded to the words of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he loses the election, and another editorial that says that the President is preparing to reach himself, living over Demings: "That so much as suggested catching up to himself made me get sick".
“ But who would ever do it other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It is not to be possible to get away with breaking laws and to ignore the Constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he hates losing.
I can quite believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways of managing it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those on a team who make it happen."

Alibaba and Jack Ma courted in Gurugram over the charges of ex-employee
Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been targeted for trial in Gurugram after a former company employee claimed that he had been fired for protesting censorship and false news in the company's programs.
The case is addressed in the Gurugram District Court, and private court judge Sonia Sheokand has issued a subpoena for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and more than 10 others, asking them to appear in court on 29 July, according to news reports.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who worked at UC Web's office in Gurugram until October 2017, is requesting $268,000 US dollars in damages under court documents.
“ We live up to the company's commitment to the Indian market and the well-being of its employees, and its policies are in accordance with current law.
We cannot comment on the ongoing lawsuit," said UC India in a statement.
"The lawsuit also contains a "list of sensitive words" containing passwords in Hindi and English such as the "border of India and China" and the "war between China and India" claimed in the lawsuit that UC Web uses to censor content on its systems in India," according to Reuters.
Last month, the Ministry of the Interior banned 59 Chinese mobile apps, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with increased tensions between the two countries.
A representative of the New York City Fire Department says it "completely" okay to exempt a white firefighter from a guard of honor
A representative handling issues of diversity at the New York City Fire Department says it is "absolutely" okay to keep a white firefighter out of honor so that flag bearers can all be black, according to a new report.
White firefighter Daniel McWilliams has filed a racial discrimination lawsuit after he was taken from among flag bearers at a memorial Mass in November 2017 to commemorate fallen members of the Vulcan Society, a fraternity of black firefighters.
The fire department's chief representative in the field of diversity and accessibility, lawyer Cecilia Loving, further defended the decision in a hearing by the New York State Department of Human Rights, according to the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of the unit's three firefighters who in historic form are seen lifting the American flag at Ground Zero in the days following the September 11 attacks.
According to McWilliam's complaint, the fire department's ceremony department had chosen him to be one of the flag bearers in honor of the memorial.
Being a flag bearer at this ceremony was a "great honor and privilege" for McWilliams, according to the lawsuit under CNN.
When he attended the ceremony, however, he was prevented from taking part in the Medal of Honor by the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for, allegedly, she had asked for all flag bearers at the Mass to be black.
She then asked McWilliams – a 29-year-old employee of the New York City Fire Department – to assist in a different way."
Among the claims that she asked him to do is to provide escorts to civilians and set up uniformed firefighters away from the Mass.
McWilliams claims in his lawsuit that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the guard of honor because he was not black.
She confirmed that it was so, he said.
Wilson, who has served with the New York City Fire Department for 21 years and who also participated in the September 11 rescue work, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams asserts that he left the memorial "to spare himself further shame, humiliation and shame," as friends and colleagues heard what went between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When Loving, who is black, testified in court, McWilliam's attorney, Keith Sullivan, asked her that, "So asking that everyone be black in honor is not discrimination?"
"No, it's not," said Loving, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it was okay to ask for everyone to be black in honors, to which she replied, "Totally".
Loving explained that it was okay to replace a white individual with a black individual to "reveal our uniqueness and different origins to create pride, solidarity and support for one another".
McWilliams first filed a complaint of discrimination based on race with the New York City Fire Department in January 2018.
He then filed a lawsuit against Wilson, the New York City Fire Department, New York City, and unidentified individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams filed his complaint, Wilson's supporters had retaliated and threatened him.
At one point one of her supporters will have put their hands on McWilliams saying, 'I've heard of you, they told me you'd act like this, and now you know who I am.'
In an excerpt, Sullivan wrote that it would have been "horrible" to exclude McWilliams from honorary merit at the Mass and a sign that one did not apply to everyone at the Fire Department.
"If you are a black individual and discriminate against a white person in the workplace, you will receive at most a reminder," Sullivan said.
Wilson, according to the lawsuit, was given "advisory advice for one hour" due to her treatment of McWilliams.
Meanwhile, a white individual who discriminates against a black person receives a "harsh punishment", Sullivan wrote.
"The New York City shutdown has produced a policy and process designed to please members of the Vulcan Society, who act racistally, excuse their actions and team them ... and this needs to be stopped," Sullivan also wrote.
Threatened by a pedestrian, demanding money
One was arrested in the city centre after an attempted robbery in which he threatened a pedestrian and tried to get money from the person.
The man was saved in a prison cell.
The police were then notified of a man with a knife in the centre of town.
The knife was confiscated and and a report was taken by the person.
Over eighty cases entered the police table in the capital area from 17 a.m. to 05 p.m. and this morning six were saved in a prison cell.
Stop police including the driver of an automobile that pulled a trailer on Kjalarnes where the trailer's wheelware was in very bad condition.
The trailer was stationary, and the owner intended to provide a means of transportation to transport it to the town.
Then police stopped the production of drugs in the Town.
Two were arrested over the case and were released after reporting.
There was also an announcement of individuals shooting up fireworks in the Town.
Had they run away from the scene by the time police arrived at the site, "the shame is probably known to them as there is still a considerable distance to the end of the year."
Thousands of Khabarovsk residents still demand Putin's resignation
Thousands of city dwellers rallied the forces of the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday, protesting the arrest of the regional governor in the same province south of Eastern Russia and the inauguration of his successor, who has never lived in the region.
The previous regional governor, Sergei Furgal, is highly popular, and tens of thousands of citizens protested when he was arrested and taken into Moscow custody earlier this month, accused of ordering the murder of three businessmen fifteen years ago.
In the recent week, Furgal was formally dismissed as regional manager and his 39-year-old party brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, appointed in his place, to little fascination with the locals.
Is Degtaryev said to be inexperienced and, worse, without any connection to Khabarovsk and called for his resignation the snare.
Those calls, Degtaryev has acted as a wind over his ears.
The protesters yesterday were little fewer than in the initial protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the Liberation of Furgal and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
"We want the regional governor to be released, because we believe his arrest is highly likely to be unlawful," the AFP news agency quotes a semi-thirty protester, Alina Slepovu.
She asserts that Kremlin agents had Furgal arrested "to defend her own interests, but not the interests of the region."
Police in Khabarovsk left protesters unopposed despite the march being a cloud-free violation of the current meeting ban due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
However, in Moscow, police arrested at least ten people who gathered in Pusjkin Square to show support to protesters in Khabarovsk in action, says a report by the British newspaper Guardian.
Furgal's party, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is a party of hardline nationalists, and is considered by political commentators to be quite loyal to the Kremlin government in most cases.
However, the same political commentators inform the BBC that Furgal's victory in the regional governorship election two years ago — which was great and harsh — was a considerable blow to Putin and United Russia, and although suggests that the Kremlin's power in the eastern provinces was weakening.
Furgal was arrested on 9 July and taken to Moscow, where he is awaiting trial.
He is charged with ordering three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were committed, and the third went out of the way.
Sarah Rainsford, the BBC's Moscow correspondent, says Furgal's followers, who enjoy high popularity at home, convinced that the charge and arrest are politically rooted.
They want to know why the government has waited with his arrest until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged offences.

Homeless women with disabilities participate in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman who is educated as a tailor, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid infectious area in Chennai, where about 10,000 cases have been identified.
The day of work begins with her early, at 7:30 p.m., and ends at around 4:00 p.m.
It measures the heat of residents, inquires about symptoms, and educates them about the importance of wearing masks, washing their hands regularly, and keeping distance from others.
In fact, her work has led to the detection and treatment of infections in time for four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 Chennai City employees who do home screenings but are not health professionals.
The project, according to authorities, has contributed to the reduction in positive cases by 50 percent, in Chennai's daily count, while increasing in other regions of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says that not all residents are cooperative.
She adds: “Most people are willing to cooperate when they are approached by a woman with disabilities.
Some, however, become frustrated.
However, this is not to worry about.
I think people should be able to be safe.
When I come back the next day, the people are polite.
It helps build a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the city's hostel for women with disabilities and lay the fight against a Covid-19 team.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who also has disabilities, has also participated in the effort as a caretaker.
Although Kavitha has a specially equipped bike, she goes walking to meet people and holds her crutches.
‘I'm happy,' she says about the reduction in the number of infections, but adds, ‘I want to see them go down to maybe about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can get it."
On the first floor of the boarding shelter where the two live are Matilda Funceca, a basketball player who uses a wheelchair, and Manimekalai who is a teacher, and they send all the data transmitted from approximately 40 women into Chennai City's web server.
Matilda says she is not afraid of being infected by the coronavirus.
"When we help others, God protects us," she adds.
When asked what arrangements she takes, Manimekalai says: “I wear a mask, keep distance, and often wash my hands.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a siddha drink that boosts the immune system."
A few months ago, when the coronavirus first arrived in Chennai, these disabled women spent their time and abilities sewing masks for health workers in the city.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the director of the shelter, as well as the Dorcas Research Center, who operates the shelter, say: “They adapt to the needs of every moment.
In the past, masks were missing, and then they did not leave behind.
Now it's time for intervention in society and then they answered the call."
Coronavirus transmission in Tamil Nadu has now reached 200,000 after 6989 new cases in the past 24 hours, which is also the highest number of infections detected in a single day, according to official data.
Eighty-nine people have died and 7758 have recovered in the past 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206,737.
Police are trying to find out about a teenager's last trips in Helensburgh
Detectives investigating the death of a teenage boy in Helensburgh now attempt to assemble a timeline over his last trips.
The body of the 19-year-old Kirk Allan was found in a home in Johnson Court at around 06:25 on Saturday.
A 30-year-old man was arrested and police confirmed on Sunday that he had now been charged in connection with the death.
He will appear in court in Dumbarton on Monday.
Police Inspector Steve Martin said: “Our minds are with Kirk’s family and friends during these difficult times.
Officers will continue to work with the community, providing support.
Our research continues to focus on getting a full picture of what took place, especially Kirk's travels in the last few days before his death, however we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox tell of their experiences of discrimination
In recent weeks, it has become clear that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racial discrimination in sports in South Africa.
Upbuilding dialogue needs to take place and action must be taken to make everyone welcome in sports.
Ashwell Prince, a former cricket star at Proteas, made his white former teammates hear it, accusing them of racism by saying he and other black team members were "vocal players".
Prince said the black players of Proteas had been officially named "quintessential players" by their white teammates.
He added that it was sad that even though black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada achieved top ratings in the sport, some people still linked them to the quota debate.
Prince, who is now the coach of the Cape Cobras team, dropped these remarks at a United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organizations (UCSCBO) web conference on Thursday night.
The organization's goal is to continue the fiery debate on historic racial discrimination in South African sports.
"As I said when I lightened up on social media, it is not my intention to come and pull people's names down to the field, but these are real incidents ...
‘You do everything right, but you get infected anyway'
Paul Roberts, a former musician and builder who became a NASA programmer, now works at a software company.
He and his wife, a former nurse at the Methodist Hospital who sees himself as an optimist, kept out an amateur magazine online and attended Comic Con events earlier in years.
Once a week, they puzzle with two of their daughters, a son-in-law and a 7-year-old grandson and play sensational Uno games.
"They're amazing nerds," says Roman, 38, about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65, is aware of the dangers of the pandemic – she has diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put her at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a catheter that keeps a previously blocked coronary artery open.
"We've been so careful, extremely careful, and stayed away from people," said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began working from home this spring, when the outbreak fought hard in Washington State, New York and other areas throughout the country.
Paul has occasionally gone to a supermarket during "old-time", and their only real date in the past month was according to Sheryl as they began to look at wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter was also careful.
But then she came home sneezing from work one day in mid - June and thought that she was allergic.
Soon she developed cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all taste and sense of smell, which are typical symptoms of the coronavirus.
"She said, 'I don't know what's going on, Mom, but I was wearing a mask, wearing gloves, washing my hands'", said Sheryl.
‘You do everything right, but you still get infected.'
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with a positive coronavirus infection, did not become seriously ill.
However, the situation got much worse with her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife began to sneeze and then cough, just like their daughter, and then developed a fever and severe pain in the body.
Then he became "againally ill, disciplinaryly quick", said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he became confused.
Worried, she checked his oxygen level.
It was low and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency room, a second time in two days.
The former royal couple felt it was "hungry" in the Queen's Christmas speech, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry of the United Kingdom felt his grandmother, Queen of the United Kingdom, had "hunted" them in her Christmas speech.
The couple's new biography, "Finding Freedom", states that they felt overlooked in the photo gallery that could be seen in the Christmas address.
Images on the desk that the Queen sat at showed included Prince William of the United Kingdom, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Prince Charles of the United Kingdom and his wife Kamilla as well as Prince Philip.
However, Meghan and Harry were nowhere to be seen despite Archie having been born in May, however the boy was mentioned as Her Majesty's "eternal grandson".
The new book, published in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton "were never friends" as they "have difficulty getting over superficial courtesy" and only met a few times.
Yesterday, Harry and his brother William's disagreements were claimed to have begun some years before his relationship with Meghan began but that it culminated due to the marriage of William and Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was a "warrior" at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and it is claimed that "he wanted to change things long before Meghan came along".
Conservative Party members accuse Labour leaders of wanting to keep public servants "home forever".
Conservative Party members accuse Labour leaders of wanting public workers to be "home forever", after the leaders protested Boris Johnson's call for people to return to work
Labour officers were accused of wanting staff to "speak at home forever" after they objected to Boris Johnson's appeal to people to return to work.
The Conservative Party members were angered when a union of public and public servants told their social workers to pry their feet when their superiors ordered them to return to their workplaces.
Former Secretary Andrew Percy said it "unacceptable" that essential public services such as the release of passports were a stop while public market staff had worked hard to keep the community going during the coronavirus pandemic.
"It is unacceptable for people to refuse to return to their jobs while employees in warehouses and factories across the country have continued to work so that public employees could eat during this time," he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to take summer vacations, but they cannot because of the people who refuse to go back to their workplaces, even though they are safe.
Labour officers cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever – especially now that we know that people can return to work safely."
Following the Prime Minister's call last week, Alex Chisholm, the newly appointed Director of Public Service, announced that agencies were to "return from public service workers working from home, and accelerate their return to their workplaces until August 1".
The Public and General Staff Workers' Association expressed this requirement to their social workers, who estimated about 200,000 people, that they did not have to comply with this demand, and said this was about politics.
A spokesperson for the public and general workers' union, the largest public sector workers' union in the United Kingdom, said that the requirement to return to the workplace was "not expressed by the health and safety of our social workers in the first place, or to strengthen the economy.
This is singled out due to political pressure from members of the Conservative Party who demand that public services be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to social workers is clear: if you do your job at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to the workplace, don't take it for granted that you need to do it."
The dispute is due to increasing dissatisfaction with the delayed issue of passports due to staff working at home, but about 400,000 people are now said to be waiting for the processing of their applications.
The Ministry of the Interior has now issued that it will "seem to accelerate" applications from the British due to travel over the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport release for more than four weeks.
The Public and General Staff Workers Association has admitted that some people had to wait for up to 143 days for passports but argues that "small and often narrow offices" make it difficult for 4,000 passport service personnel to keep the required distance.
Former government minister David Davis urged union leaders to "behave wisely" and seek ways in cooperation with the government to bring people back into their workplaces.
He added that if he was in government, he would ask a union officer, "What is it you want? that people stay at home all summer?"
However, various of the UK's largest companies have similarly ignored Johnson's recommendations to people to return to work.
A study of larger workplaces with a total of about 400,000 employees found that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
Emphasis on History Can Have an Important Reconciliation Role
The gulf has widened, but understanding and reconciliation should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught by Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only discipline specifically deals with our history – the "Saga of Australia" for 12th grade – will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in the state of Victoria completed studies in Australian history out of a total of 49,324 who completed primary school, or only 1%.
Over the past six years, this number has been almost reduced by half, but nearly 100 fewer students enroll in the profession every year.
The main reason that so few students choose to learn about Australian history in 12th grade is that little has been done in previous years of study to interest them.
History is not even a unique area of study, but it falls under the broader "mental sciences".
Therefore, students in 7th and 8th grades complete only one short unit of "original and islanders on the Torres Strait and their culture".
In Years 9 and 10, there is another entity across Australia during the World Wars.
For many students in Victoria, this is all what is taught about the history of Australia during the elementary school years.
In Years 9 and 10, there is another optional unit for the period 1750-1918.
It is important to take three measures to save Australian history in the schools of the State of Victoria.
First, like English, mathematics, and science, a story must become an independent subject.
Since a story is only taught as part of the intellectual sciences, it receives little space in the curriculum.
It is usually taught by people who have a general education within intellectuals but have not educated themselves in history.
Historic skills such as the analysis of information are complex.
We must hire more specialized history teachers to ensure that such skills are taught in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, Australia's history from 1788 to 1914 must become a compulsory branch.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australian history in the 12th year of study because then they would have had to learn the material from scratch.
Knowledge of history alone does not bridge deep gaps between races.
But without it, as can be clearly seen in the Victorian State curriculum, the project is hopeless.

Aron Elis in European Seat final - Isaac split off at halftime
Aron Elis Trándarson has reached the final for a European place in the Danish Football Championship.
Isaac Bergmann Johnson played only the first half with Norrköping's top team against Falkenberg's bottom team in Sweden.
Aron Elis was part of the OB team in Denmark when the team advanced to the final for a place in the European League premiership.
OB will face AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final, depending on whether the teams end up above after the final round of the top part of the Danish Premier League later today.
Aron Elis played the entire match in a 1—1 draw with Horsens in the outfield today, but OB had won the teams' previous game at home, 3–1, thus winning the singles total 4–2.
Isaac was part of Norrköping's starting team which was a surprise 2–0 under after the first half against bottom team Falkenberg in the Swedish Premier League.
Norrköping made a triple split at the start of the second half, and Isaac was one of those who had to depart.
Norrköping equalised the score, but Falkenberg made it 3–2 in the 89th minute.
However, there was still time for Norrköping to equalise from hell at the last minute, 3–3.
Norrköping remain at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö who has a game to good later today.
The score was enough for Falkenberg to get off the bottom for the time being, but the team is level above Helsingborg and Kalmar who have a game for good.
Archives sources of National Celebration at Coronavirus Times
Anna Lilly Sigurðardóttir founded the Facebook group "My National Festival 2020" to gather records of the national festival that the Islanders plan to hold next weekend.
Many people plan to camp in their gardens and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilly chatted with Hvata in the Weekend episode of the Wave.
"There's nothing in yet that's very exciting too because there are 600 people in the crowd so that people are clearly going to do something," Anna Lilja says.
There's something about the islanders going to have camping parties at home in a park.
"Men have talked about having their own [festival], maybe camping in the park and hoarding the family together as men always do at this time," Anna says.
“ One assumes that humans will spend time with their people.
However, she says it is likely that many people will simply not be on the spot "but still have some little National Festival somewhere else."
The National Celebration Committee is now working hard to reimburse the tickets purchased, while Anna believes many locals are planning to secure tickets for next year's festival.
"Men are even investing now in the tickets and leaving valid by 2021."
"I'm a big National Festival winner, I love the preparations and all around this but sometimes something comes into life that you don't control any way and then it's just like that," Anna says but reportedly has quite a point where people ask if the Islanders can't release a National Festival "such once."
Anna Lilly claims to have founded the group not for herself or to encourage people to hold their own National Festival but to gather records of Traders Sanctuary celebrations in the Isles this year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this for one thing or anything but then there are some people who use these kinds of sources in something but I was just creating some area where people can put in what they're doing."
At the same time, Fjösaklett burning has been uploaded, which is lit each year.
“ I think a lot of people are excited to get a burn on Friday night.
The only thing that, of course, makes a dash into it is that the forecast is no spes."
"This burning will be set on fire but it will only have to be revealed what it will be like," Anna Lilja says.
You can listen to the interview with Anna Lilly as a whole in the player below.
Will Prince Andrew be mentioned in new sexual assault cases?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in court documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A U.S. judge has ordered that classified documents about Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Among the items contained in these 80 pages of documents are parts with Maxwell's testimony as of 2016
The exposure of these pages could also put great pressure on Prince Andrew, as they contain communications between Maxwell and Epstein as of January 2015
Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the month American financier, claimed in 2015 in court documents that she had been forced to have a conversation with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrew is now preparing to defend himself against the possible release of information this week with even more damaging allegations of his friendship with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered in the week before the release of 80 classified legal documents relating to Maxwell and Epstein counting hundreds of pages.
The presentation of these extremely extensive documents would be a blow to the 58-year-old Maxwell as they contain large portions with her testimony before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said was "problem questions" about her sexual history.
They could also put a lot of pressure on Prince Andrews, as one of the documents contains communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the month American financier, claimed in 2015 in court documents that she had been forced three times to have a conversation with Andrew.
Andrew has repeatedly and conclusively rejected these claims.
An e-mail from 2015 that has been leaked and the BBC published last year seems to indicate that Andrews asked Maxwell for help in responding to Roberts' claims.
We are in no doubt that the Duke will be repulsed
There he told the superintendent, "Let me know when we can talk, have certain questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts."
Maxwell replied, "Have information. Call me when you have a moment."
Last night, a source close to Andrew said: “The Hertog of Jorvik has done nothing wrong, so we are not concerned about the opening of a court document.
As the courts in the United States have made efforts to point out, this does not mean that an accusation is true even if it appears in court documents.
U.S. courts have urged the press and the public to exercise extreme caution in the treatment of allegations that appear in court documents.
We completely agree with that.
We have no doubt that the Duke will receive a full reprieve in the coming weeks."
Maxwell is currently in custody at a detention center in Manhattan, awaiting trial for finding and seducing some of Epstein's underage victims from 1994 to 1997.
She is also accused of perjury for denying knowledge during a report of his abuse.
She rejects all charges.
Maxwell last discussed with lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Roberts' injury speech head, which now goes by the last name Giuffre, which she adopted after marriage.
About 40 pages out of a total of 418 with that testimony were made public last year, but after Judge Presna's ruling in New York last week, more parts could be opened in the first place on Thursday.
Maxwell's lawyers received one week to file an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell last year as he was awaiting trial for sexual assault.
Detectives search gangs for violent attack on Edinburgh streets
Three people attacked a man in Edinburgh and sustained injuries that could prove permanent.
The 29-year-old victim was attacked in Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 p.m. on Saturday.
Scottish police reported that he had been taken to the Royal Hospital with serious injuries.
Detective Superintendent Dale Miles, who heads the investigation, said, "It was a violent and unprovoked attack."
The suspects fled towards Newtoft Street.
One of these was believed to be in his 30s, about 180 cm tall and strongly grown.
He was short-cut and dark-haired in white shirt, dark pants and dark shoes.
Detective Inspector Miles said, "I ask everyone who was in this area at the time of the attack and saw something suspicious about turning themselves in."
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. Ambassador to Iceland, wants to carry a gun in this country and wants increased security.
He is said to have been "friendly" about his safety since he arrived in the country last year.
This is stated in a CBS report, which also states that this wants Gunter, despite him working in "one of the safest states in the world".
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. State Department to solicit from the Icelandic government that he may carry a gun.
Then he has asked for an armored car and a vest that defends him against knife stablings.
Sources for CBS say the Ministry has repeatedly notified Gunter that he is not in danger in Iceland.
According to a CBS report, Iceland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not provide information on whether a request was received from the United States for the potential armament of Gunter, because authorities do not comment on foreign ambassadors' security measures.
However, sources from the news agency say that no request has been made.
Then CBS also has it after its sources that Gunter was told that he should not seek to carry arms, therefore would be taken as an insult in this country.
Gunter is inexperience as an ambassador, but he has been a dermatologist in California for years.
He is active in the Republican Party of the United States and a keen supporter of President Donald Trump.
He recently attracted attention in this country when he tweeted about the "invisible China virus".
CBS sources also say that Gunter came down sharply on the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavík.
He already had seven second-in-command staff at the embassy from May last year.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to the "Deep Kingdom" so-called, supposedly a network of U.S. officials working against Trump, and reacted angrily to one carrying snow into his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February for a conference and he refused to return to Iceland for several months, according to CBS sources.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but ultimately, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had to order him to return and he did so in May.
The home game format is a key point for Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has easier games to come by when devotees get to return to games
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game at home since the Premier League relaunch, but he says that it would be much easier to maintain a good run at home if spectators were let to games.
Spurs have won 12 victories at home in this season, but lost four times – only one of the six teams above them has lost more at home.
The coach Portuguese said that although such a triumph was possible without the devotees, it would be easier to maintain if they were on site.
"We have to do this with the fans, without which some kind of fortification can be built, as the game plan is in the foreground," he said.
"But I believe it would be much more powerful to do so with the fans, because then the emotional side of the game is added, which is only achieved with the help of fans at the home stadium."
Mourinho believes that with stronger rivals, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain the long winning seasons at home he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built for the past three seasons.
But this is also a key factor in determining whether the teams achieve their goals at the end of the season, especially in even games and neighboring songs, where the atmosphere on the field can make a difference.
"I believe that the policy in the elite is that it is now becoming increasingly difficult to beat this unbeaten record, because of how good the teams have become."
"On the other hand, being strong on home soil is crucial and at the end of the season have downloaded a number of points with victories in home games."
“ I'm happy with the finals from home games recently, without the fans, but we need them back.
I envision a win against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
This is a empathy that is built up gradually."
Buyers excited about coveted lifestyle property at Lovely Banks
'Greater is better', is clearly the motto of the new owners of a huge estate in the Lovely Banks neighborhood, sold recently at 1270 Australian dollars.
Interested buyers looking for a lifestyle property in close proximity to downtown Geelong flocked to view this 1.35 hectare estate, where you can find a car shelter for 14 cars, a swimming pool and a view of the Corio River.
Joe Grgic, a real estate agent in Harcourts, North Geelong, said that an offer to the estate that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of its launch.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back for sale
A Home Perfect for Isolation
"We received a number of offers from various parties," Grgic said.
‘The money sold to a local man who is very excited.'
The estate follows a four-room house on two floors that includes a custom bath room large enough to accommodate a sofa.
The new owners have a choice of three parlors and can make use of a renovated kitchen and upgraded outdoor area overlooking the swimming pool.
"This lay in the way the property was composed, that it was three acres, and that it was in this place," Grgic said.
“ Here came interested merchants from Melbourne who wondered what the property was centrally but still rural.
‘I have people who missed and buyers who are still looking.'
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and free-standing shelter that accommodates 10-12 vehicles, was perfect for industrialists or for storing trailers and aftercarriages.
Counting its security threatened in Iceland
"Despite being appointed to one of the safest countries in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been paranoid about his safety since his arrival in Reykjavík last year."
This is how CBS News' detailed coverage of the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland begins, but this emulates numerous sources of CBS from the U.S. Foreign Service.
CBS's coverage claims that Gunter requested to the U.S. State Department that he be given a special permit by the Icelandic government to carry firearms.
He is then also supposed to have requested an armored car, as well as to have accrued ideas for a vest that could protect him from knife sting attacks.
The U.S. State Department refused to publicly state whether Gunter's security is truly threatened in Iceland, but according to information from officials, Gunter has been repeatedly expressed that he is not in any particular danger.
Even so, the U.S. Embassy in Iceland recently advertised for full-time bodyguards, including in the morning of July 18, the past, but CBS sources suggest it is done to calm Gunter's concerns.
The U.S. State Department does not comment on seeing security measures related to its embassies but always says it is the goal that security be guaranteed by preventive means.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not answer questions relating to Gunter's wish to weaponize, and the Icelandic Foreign Ministry does not want to state whether the United States has formally requested that the ambassador be allowed to carry a firearm, and does not normally say that he will comment on foreign envoy security matters.
However, CBS quotes its Icelandic sources as saying that the request of that subject was never submitted, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was obtained from top of these plans as they could lead to offensive locals in Iceland.
At the same time, CBS's coverage discusses the various dilemmas that have been attractive to the U.S. Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will have already replaced his deputy ambassador seven times.
Thus, the first deputy ambassador is said to have long prepared for his job and learned Icelandic only in order to have been denied the position at the last minute because Gunter "didn't like him" at their first meeting.
His successors have not gone much better under Gunter's rule.
Administrators within the U.S. State Department are said to be aware of the position at the embassy in Iceland, but reluctant to intervene in matters related to the president's close ties.
In addition to all of this, Gunter is said to be reluctant to follow the various rules of foreign service and respect the hierarchy.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a conference in Washington, and is said to have refused to return to Iceland as a result and had his temporary replacement do his job for months, and that in the middle of a pandemic.
Will Gunter even have wished to do his job in remote employment and said he would not return to Iceland unless the foreign minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically requested it.
According to information from the U.S. State Department, Gunter had decided to take a personal leave at the end of the conference and the coronavirus pandemic delayed his passage further, but according to CBS sources, numerous within the Department will have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but this did not occur until May, following Pompeo's contact with him and please ask him to return to the embassy in Iceland.
At the same time, CBS's coverage recounts Gunter's unpopularity in Iceland, especially in connection with a titter in which he calls the crown virus the "invisible China virus" and has received much criticism for.
Gunter is one of numerous, almost inexperienced, foreign affairs service ambassadors appointed during the reign of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Sachin Pilot vs Ashok Gehlot; Bharatiya Janata Party says government crisis in state; Kongress Party wants vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if it happened, the Kongress Party would need to materialize a sit-in protest outside the Prime Minister's home.
On Saturday, a day after a peaceful protest at Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, Rajasthan's Chief Minister, said that if that happened, members of the Kongress Party would have to meet with the President and materialize a sit-in protest outside the Prime Minister's home to lead the crisis in the state to the end.
At a meeting of the members of the Kongress Party, Gehlot indicated that a vote was planned to be held to see if a majority of the party's members and fellow MPs sided with him in the power struggle.
"He said the government has a majority and wants to go to a vote," says a statement by Mahesh Joshi, the main party defender of the Kongress Party, after the meeting.
The parliamentary session was held at a hotel where the delegates who support Gehlot have remained in the past few days.
“ The prime minister asked us to be prepared to stay at the hotel for more time.
If necessary, he said, he would meet with the president and also hold peaceful protests outside the Prime Minister's home" said a party leader.
Rajasthan's chief minister can convene the parliament and have the Kongress Party demonstrate its majority, said party leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, and indicated that the plot of the Bharatiya Janata Party had been uncovered to overthrow the Ashok Gehlot government.
"The country is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are formed and operate by the people's mandate.
It has uncovered the plot of Bharatiya Janata to overthrow the government of Rajasthan.
This is an insult to the 80 million inhabitants of Rajasthan.
The Chief Minister must convene the parliament in order for the truth to precede the country," said Gandhi in a titling of Hindi.
Ashok Gehlot, Chief Minister of Rajasthan, told members of the Kongress Party on Saturday that he was prepared to go to a meeting of the President of India to ensure that what he calls the "advisory Bharatiya Janata" to delay a declaration of confidence by a vote is unsuccessful.
Gehlot, who protested for hours at the home of Governor Kalraj Mishra on Friday to press a parliamentary session, met with members of the Kongress Party and government on Saturday, and after the meeting new proposals were constructed and approved by a government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to file the parliamentary hearing request again, citing six objections.
The proposal will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of stalling the Senate session as he is "under pressure" to delay the vote which cuts confidence in his government.
When Gehlot met with his government, Bharatiya Janata's delegation in the leadership of leader Satish Poonia and the leader of the Gulab Chandra Kataria government met with the governor to discuss COVID-19's position in the state.

The actress Spencer Grammer given a cut outside a Manhattan restaurant
NEW YORK – The actress Spencer Grammar said she was trying to calm an angry man when he cut her arm and stabbed her friend in the back outside a New York City restaurant last Friday.
Grammer, who is 36, told US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same circumstances and that they had been trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend sat at a luncheon at an outboard on The Black Ant in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood at around 23:30
on Friday when a man walked up to them and demanded a settlement, at which point the restaurant was being closed.
Grammer and her friend were injured when they tried to "resolve differences between an unknown male and other local visitors," according to police.
The male ran off the spot after injuring Grammer's right arm and stabbing her friend in the narrow back with an unknown pointed object, police said.
No one has been arrested.
Grammer, speaking in for Summer in the episode "Rick and Morty" and previously playing in the series "Green" on ABC Family, is the daughter of "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both she and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a statement to the US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded on the scene and the Bellevue Hospital staff who nurtured them, citing the "remarkable struggle" of this staff with the coronavirus pandemic.
"It really touched us to have the opportunity to thank them in person," said Grammer.
"I don't want to be like McGregor and show my money ...
I'm here to help people" — Chimaev by historic night at UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
Battlecruiser Khamzat Chimaev of Russia is now named as the next star of the UFC after signing up for the story on Fight Island, but he says he does not aim to flaunt his wealth in a capricious manner like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried Northern Irishman Rhys McKee outnumbered in their fight in a rollweight in Abu Dabi on Saturday night as he defeated his rival when three minutes and 9 seconds had passed by the first round by having the punches hit him in the floor.
The victory recorded Chimaev's name in UFC history books for the shortest time between victories in modern history of the competition, with only 10 days gone since defeating Britishman John Phillips in a similarly decisive manner, then in middleweight.
Chimaev, who has a winning percentage of 8-0, received a $50,000 US bonus for tonight's performance versus McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now referred to as "Khalib 2.0", which can be said to be an inevitable comparison due to the degree of similarity between Chimaev's superiorness and the UFC Champion's light heavyweight and since he is born in Chechnya, a near-home affair of Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite his newfound fame and financial gains, the translated Chimaev has said that he would not be willing to flaunt his wealth, as did MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his equal in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I don’t just do it for myself, I do it for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or anything like that.
I want to help people," Chimaev replied when asked on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
Among other things, he has attracted the attention of teammate Conor McGregor and active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social media that he could "extremely" defeat Chimaev by surrender.
It did not stand on a poisonous answer from the fighter who goes by the name of "Borz", or "wolf" in his native tétensk, who said that he would "mala Danis with his eyes closed".
Chimaev, who is now staying in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the country at the age of 19, may have little to do with his financial power, but he is clearly unfavourable in wearing his fighting abilities.
“ I can grind anyone ...
How many fighters are there in the rollweight division?
I can grind them all," he said.
"Give me 77 kilograms of champion (welterweight), 84 kilograms of champion (millimeter), I grind them both, on the same day."
Israelis continue to protest the Prime Minister's response to the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) – Thousands of Israelis held protests against the Prime Minister in many parts of the country on Saturday and were the largest protest outside the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for several weeks, but they began due to what critics believe the government's failure to respond to the coronavirus epidemic after initially managing to contain the threat of the virus.
Charges against Netanyahu over corruption have further spurred the protests.
‘Bibi, go home,' stood on the sign of one of the protesters.
A second panel read: "Everyone sees that the Emperor has lost his clothes".
Also, hundreds of protesters gathered outside Netanyahu's beachhouse in the prosperous town of Caesarea.
Last week, police used water guns to disperse groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called a rash and unorganized re-opening of the economy in May, the average number of new cases per day rose to 2,000.
The country's economy has been hit by restrictions from the virus, and unemployment has greatly increased to nearly 20%.
The protestors say that the government's financial aid has nowhere near enough.
The protest took place in the shadow of a trial on corruption charges against Netanyahu, which resumed this month.
Hearings begin in January.
He is charged with fraud, breach of confidence, and bribery in a series of scandals.
Hundreds of protesters gather in downtown Los Angeles to show solidarity with protesters in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – About 300 protesters gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon in support of a two-month-old movement in Portland, Oregon, with attention focused on federal investigators after clashes with protesters.
Similar protest meetings took place throughout the United States, including in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The Los Angeles protests were organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front groups.
The group marched to the Los Angeles Police Headquarters on First Street and Main Street and next to the metropolitan area detention center.
The participants also moved to Alameda-afreinina on Highway 101, but later left it.
A portion of the people were seen breaking windows in federal buildings in the downtown area, and fictitious words were written on federal markings.
At least one person was arrested during the protests.
50 crowd restrictions in mosques at Eid festival and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, Karnataka government says
The Eid-ul-Azha festival, or Bakrid, takes place on 31 July and 1 August.
Governments in Karnataka have issued that only 50 may meet in mosques for prayers due to Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer meetings at Eidgah and other locations due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Visitors wishing to pray in mosques must wear masks and keep distance, under orders from AB Ibrahim, the commissioner of minorities and Wakf affairs.
The order states that the Hilal Commission decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, should be held on 31 July in the provinces of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu, but on 1 August elsewhere in the state.
It is noted in the order that although prayer gatherings are one of the most important Muslim rituals during the Bakrid Festival, such events at Eidgah and other locations will be banned due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Prayers, however, will be allowed in mosques provided that no more than 50 participate at a time.
More than the times of prayer should be divided, says the Ministry in the decree.
Prayer meetings are not to be held anywhere else, such as meeting houses, social centers, or "Shadi Mahal", according to reports.
The Karnataka government allows for temples, mosques and other prayer sites to be open to those wishing to pray from 8 June, provided the protection of infectious protection is well taken due to COVID-19.
US ambassador wants armed bodyguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. Ambassador to Iceland, believes his life is threatened locally and wants to wear a weapon.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Embassy repeatedly advertised for bodyguards "bodyguard" in Icelandic newspapers, actually using the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Kveikt's sources, the main reason these jobs were advertised is that Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes his life is threatened in Iceland.
Kveil has discussed with sources in Iceland and abroad who say the ambassador is convinced that he is in grave danger, and the reason is that he is of Jewish origin.
What the threat is, is not as clear, but Kveikt's interviewers said that Islamic terrorists had been cited as a threat.
TV station CBS discussed the issue on its website this morning and quotes Washington sources as saying Gunter is persecuted, insisting on carrying a weapon himself, getting a punctured vest and armed escort as well as a bullet-proof vehicle.
According to CBS sources, Gunter has been repeatedly told that there is no threat, and that the advertisement by "bodyguard" is only to quiet Gunter.
According to Kveikt's sources, the posts had not been hired by the end of June, but application deadline passed in February.
According to Kveikt's sources, there has not been a formal message from the U.S. embassy about these changes.
Neither increased care nor authorization has been formally requested for bodyguards to walk armed around outside the embassy's walls.
English law is decisive that such is not permitted except by special authorization from the Governor General.
Interviewers of the Kvik within the control system say there is no information on any kind of threat.
The latest risk assessment by the State Commissioner is quite decisive on terrorist threats.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence of terrorist or extremist groups working here.
The premise of authorizing the armament of the bodyguards of a foreign embassy on the streets of cities and towns in Iceland is, according to Kveikt's sources, not present.
Gunter attracted considerable attention in this country when he shared the U.S. President's picket, calling COVID-19 the "China virus".
With the tit, he then had the American and Icelandic flag.
A Seattle radio man who mocked Trump's response to protest says he now needs to get a gun after a Starbucks cafe below his apartment was destroyed – RT USA News
Paul Gallant has received a new perspective on violent protests after mocking U.S. President Donald Trump in June for saying that anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle City.
All it took was for the fuss to move closer to the director's home.
"I feel like I have to buy a firearm because this will clearly continue to happen," said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that vandals had "destroyed" the Starbucks cafe on the bottom floor of his apartment building.
It looks like a street party down the street from me.
The similarity was quite different when Trump complained last month that the mayor of Seattle was allowing violent protesters to take over the city.
"These liberal Democrats are reckless," the president said.
"The terrorists burn and plunder our cities and they just think it's wonderful, even death."
Gallant, who is co-director of the show "Danny & Gallant" at ESPN's associate radio station in Seattle, responded with a titling, "Going through there for a curious kiss last night and seeing neither burns, robberies, nor deaths. relaxing salmon."
Gallant said last night that police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building as explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks cafe.
He published photos of the damage, saying, "Well done, morons," and stated that he had also seen a fire a few blocks away.
‘Have no idea what's going on, but the cat and I are going to find out.'
The reversal did not go unnoticed by people who mocked Gallant for his earlier opinion, picking messages such as "Just Relax salmon," and "Jah, maybe Trump was right".
Jason Rantz, another Seattle radio broadcaster, said "I guess we're not finally going on this tour we discussed."
Gallant walked by the joke: "Wake up and saw that a lot of people were picking 'slapping on salmon' to me. I laughed."
He said he stood by his previous claim as he had passed through the CHAZ self-governing anarchist zone and although it was not as bad as it had been extant as.
"So there were then burns and robberies after all," he said. "demonstration."
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34, in a residential search with her 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together on the set of the White Lines show, which features succulent and disgusting on Ibiza, but during a housing search in the past week their appearance was second and quieter, away from the party island's sensuality.
The pair, who play siblings in the Netflix series popularly, were seen viewing an impressive rural settlement in Oxfordshire, which is for sale at £1.2 million.
They attended the area of Range Rover, which Laura, 34, drove, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt, and met a real estate broker who led them on a tour of the five-room house.
In White Lines, recorded last fall, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who gets to know the darker side of Ibiza when she investigates the murder of her brother, DJ Alex, played by Tom, aged 28.
Their relationship was not discovered until earlier this month, less than a year from the end of Laura and Sam Claflin's six-year marriage, but he is known from the Hunger Games films.
Together, they have four-year-old son Pip and daughter Margot, who is two years old.
When they announced the divorce last August, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: “I have decided to understand legal divorce, and we understand in love, friendship, and deep respect for each other, and will continue to cooperate on our children’s upbringing.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 in an audition, and Sam, who has also played in the Peaky Blinders, described their 2013 wedding as "a huge one of the greatest achievements of my life".
Before getting her role in White Lines, Laura had acted in the previous Inbetweeners film, and in the BBC crime drama The Capture, shown last year, in which she played lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom had roles in the second Inbetweeners film and in the series Brittania from Sky.
Considers it too early to claim another wave in this country
An expert in the field of quarantine at the provincial medical office says it is too early to claim the second wave of the outbreak.
Three new domestic infections were identified in the virology department of the National Hospital yesterday and dozens are quarantined.
Two domestic infections were diagnosed on Thursday, one in a male in his twenties, and the other in a male in his twenties.
Then no infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, a further three domestic infections were then identified, one of which had been at the Rey Cup football tournament in Laughardal.
According to John K. Johansson, an intelligence officer with a state commissioner, in a conversation with a news agency, fewer people had to be sampled because of the infection than originally thought.
The second infection is with an individual who arrived from abroad on July 15.
At that time, the rules for the so-called return infection portal had come into effect.
However, Kamilla Rut Sigfussadóttir, an expert in the National Medical Service, says that the person acted on the old process.
His sample was negative upon arrival in the country, but he then became ill, has come into isolation, and six have been quarantined.
They're all on their way to a sample, but two of them are starting to show symptoms.
The third infection is then linked to the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and twelve have been quarantined in connection with it.
It has been found there that a new variant of the coronavirus that has not been identified before in this country.
“ We do not know exactly where this virus type comes from, but we have not seen it before.
He who is believed to have carried the virus to the country had been in Israel but also in other European countries."
She believes it is too early to claim that the so-called second wave of the outbreak has begun in this country, as other countries in Europe fear.
“ While the majority are still traceable, there is no tableboarding.
But we're on our toes and we're watching, minding ways to fail if anything like that could go off."
Megan Fox commenting on the relationship
Megan Fox says she found her twin soul in rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
“ As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I'm interested in constellations and I knew immediately that my twin soul was involved," says 34-year-old Fox.
"A twin soul is when the soul has reached a level of existence enough that it can divide itself into two different bodies at the same time," Fox explained.
“ So we are two halves of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I felt it right away."
“ After we had known each other for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch, and I taught him about the constellations and asked him about his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly agrees, but they got to know each other during filming.
“ I was hanging outside her trailer, hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
It is only two months since Fox left her husband for ten years, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim
The American musician, fashion mogul and presidential candidate Kanye West has apologized to Kim Kardashian West for remarks he made publicly about the family's private affairs.
"I want to apologize to my wife Kim for discussing private matters publicly," he wrote in an entry on Twitter last night.
There has been much speculation about the status of their relationship, but Kanye has recently gone heavily on social media, and at a mass meeting he held last Monday, he discussed, among other things, the birth of his daughter North West, saying he nearly killed her.
Then Kim stepped forward on Wednesday and published a message to her followers on Instagram discussing her husband's illness, but he is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously publicly commented on the husband's illness, saying it is, among other things, due to their couple's children and Kanye's right to privacy when it comes to his health.

Increased weight in protests against racism in the United States
The protesters have walked the streets of a number of cities in the United States to draw attention to racial discrimination.
A protest has lasted for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25 when George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump administration has sent federal agents to Portland, and thus still fomented the protest.
The protesters now also object to the FBI officers' presence in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, police used flare bombs and tear gas and arrested 45 people, after a protest rally in support of the Portland protests dissolved into violence.
According to police, over 20 police officers were injured.
One person died Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was fired into a Black Lives Matter march.
Media sources say that the man may have walked up to an automobile armed with a rifle, before being shot.
"The essence of the matter is that it's scary that someone should be killed in protest," said Steve Adler, Austin's mayor, in a statement.
Adler claimed to be "harm struck and wordless".
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed protesters demanded justice in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, authorized entry without knocking, and shot her.
Taylor's boyfriend had first shot at the policemen, because he thought they were burglars.
One police officer has been fired due to Taylor's death, but the other police officers have not been prosecuted.
The leader of the NFAC group, an armed group of black insurgents who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in the police investigation into Taylor's murder.
According to police information, three NFAC members were injured on Saturday when a shot accidentally ran off a weapon by the rebel army.
Potential for up-to-date cohort infection
Five people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside of border screening.
Two of them infected were diagnosed with previously unseen variants of the virus and the origin of three of the five infections appears to be completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals have been infected by a tourist who has left the country again or by an asymptomatic Icelander, who then probably infected many more.
A health care provider says that a possible group infection could be up-to-date in relation to one of the infections.
Two were identified by Covid-19 in the country last Thursday, with their respective types of the virus.
The origin of the infections remains unclear.
Three were then diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by another of those diagnosed on Thursday, another arrived in the country on July 15 last July, and probably infected outside, while the third also has an infection of unclear origin.
After sequencing by Icelandic genetic analysis, it was found that the two individuals diagnosed with the virus and associated with it have a new variant that has not been previously identified in this country.
According to Kamilla Joseph's daughter, an expert in the field of quarantine at the National Medical Center and a substitute for the Center for Disease Control, Icelandic genetic analysis is now reviewing where this type of virus most likely came from.
“ The second case was similar to a virus that has been going on in Switzerland and yet not quite the same.
They are going to look at this and try to map this better and lead bodies to what part of the world the infection comes from," she says.
‘This, however, seems to be on this side of the Atlantic.'
Therefore, the infection is unrelated to the two that emerged in early July and were traced to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has come to the outside rather than have mutated in this country?
‘Yes, this is unlike what has been found here before that there is really no chance that this was something to grind here,' answers Kamilla.
‘I think they're all likely to have in some way come across an individual who has just arrived somewhere outside, without knowing themselves.'
When asked, she says that there is currently no evidence as to where this new virus may have come from.
“ There could naturally be a tourist who has left the country again, but there may also be someone who does not develop symptoms and does not realize that he has contracted, and then there may naturally be more infections.
We'll be on our toes for the next few days to watch it."
“ So far, there is nothing that is a smart group infection.
But there are individuals who went into quarantine in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and who have already had samples," continues Kamilla.
“ We still have no results from them.
So it could potentially be a group infection in the ascent."
Do you assume there is a community infection going on now?
“ It is not ruled out.
It hasn't been lately but it's not ruled out because we don't know who has carried this infection in these individuals, who were identified on the one hand on Tuesday and on the other yesterday." she replies.
Would it be possible to talk about the start of a new wave of the virus?
“ No, not yet.
But we naturally need to be very alert, and we need to keep this in mind, even though there are so certain limits to how much samples we can take in people.
We don't take samples in asymptomatic people but first that we're getting infections that seem to be untraceable, we need to be given a little looser hands by taking samples from people with symptoms," she says.
In this way, the National Hospital of Pathology and Viral Sciences can be expected to supply in the samples over the next few days in an attempt to better map the situation here.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase domestic sampling and manage screening at the border?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there needs to be some basis for taking samples from individuals who are not in the screening projects; the person needs to be quarantined and display symptoms or have had symptoms and suspicion of having come across someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
She notes that infectious ranting is still ongoing on the infections identified yesterday and that there is now a lot of work going into obtaining information about the individuals' journeys.
She says that the origins of the domestic infections appear to be untraceable but does not rule out that any of those currently quarantined may come with clues that eventually lead the infectious team to the original infections.
The restaurant most people don't know about, but they think it's one of the best
Not everyone who has a clear location for the restaurant is a Rescue Stone, and probably it has more fans abroad than in this country if the comments about it can be marked on TripAdvisor and other pages.
There have been reports of people who have flown counter-offensively to visit him without wonder.
Berglind Hreidsdóttir, food blogger and cookbook writer, skewed on a rock of savings in the days and kept water in awe
“ I don’t know where to start, because the restaurant is a very wonderful place.
The history of the house is one of the most beautiful I know, the food of ten, the view of no worse end, and fantastically entertaining servants!" says Berglind.
“ Gunni, the owner of a rock of savings, magically spelled out one precious dish after another in front of us.
My wife and I sat down with our girls for a whole evening to eat so it must tell how good the food was," adds Berglind.
“ The house in which the restaurant is run is an old apartment building that was relocated whole on the ground.
The current owners drove their eyes to this house for sale in Acranes, found a beautiful seaside resort on the ground, and made the dream come true.
You can read more about the history of the house on the Rescue Stone website."
“ Households and all enclosures on the rock of survival are unique.
The entire family has been gathered together, and it certainly puts its own trick on the premises.
On the upper floor is a lounge and really cosy and homely to come into this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and cooking then do not conceal themselves and it is clear that much is put into the practice of enchanting tasteful and beautiful grants", says Berglind, and the images can be marked is nothing lied.

Mick Fleetwood lauds Peter Green: 'His music will live'
Mick Fleetwood praised Peter Green, co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, who died today at the age of 73.
Green was a founding member of this historic rock band along with the former Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Although Green left the band in 1970, before reaching its peak with albums such as Rumours, Mick has praised this former band member and assured fans that his "music will live on".
"For me and all former and current members of Fleetwood Mac, it's losing Peter Green a great memorial moment," Fleetwood said in a conversation with PA.
"Peter was the man who co-founded Fleetwood Mac with me, John McVie and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined Fleetwood Mac without having a deep respect for Peter Green and his talent, and the fact that the music is supposed to shine brightly and be performed by an uncompromising passion."
"Peter, I will miss you, but be sure your music will live," added the 73-year-old rock star.
“ I thank you for asking if I wanted to be your drummer all those years ago.
We did a good job, and we certainly paved a proper track of music that so many people have been allowed to enjoy.
‘God be with you, my dear friend....With love and respect, Mick Fleetwood.'
Green's death was confirmed in a statement by the law firm Swan Turton: "Peter Green's family announces with great sadness that Peter died this weekend, peacefully in his sleep.
A further statement will be published in the next few days."
Green leaves behind a daughter, Rosebud Samuels-Greenbaum, whom he had with his ex-wife, Jane Samuels.
Green co-founded Fleetwood Mac with Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, the band originally named "Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer".
However, the singer walked out of the band in 1970, after four albums.
Fleetwood Mac would receive much acclaim and enjoy worldwide popularity after more were added to the group, including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on the Rumours and Tusk albums.
Is Prince Joakim said to be stable?
Prince Joakim Dana, younger son of Queen Margaret Thorhild Dana and the late Prince Henry Dana, is still lying in a hospital in Toulouse, France, where he had surgery last day for a blood clot in his brain.
The Danish national radio broadcaster, DR, quotes a spokesperson from the Danish court as saying that it is uncertain how long the 51-year-old prince will be in the hospital, but his feeling is stable.
According to a report by the DR, the effects of the blood clot on the prince's health are now under investigation.
It quotes physician Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who discusses health issues for DR, as saying that the consequences of blood clots in the brain often do not occur until 24 hours after surgery.
‘It can range from insignificant symptoms to hemispherical paralysis, memory problems or difficulties in expression,' says Geisling.
He says that the prince could await months of rehabilitation.
Prince Joakim Dana, whose full name is Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and is also Count of Monpezat, stayed at the family wine ranch, the Château de Cayx in southern France when he fell ill on Friday night.
He was first taken to a hospital in the town of Cahors, which is just off the farm, but then taken to the University Hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent surgery for a blood clot in his brain.
Google Pixel 4 can form the galaxy
Double optimization allows the extra lens of the Pixel 4 to be seen in three dimensions, thereby delivering a better offense in the background with facial tuning than in previous Pixel phones, which relied entirely on software to achieve this so-called "bokeh" effect.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google's legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz got on stage to discuss her experiences of photography with Pixel 4 over the past 12 months.
Machinery is still in the foreground in all aspects of new smartphones from Google, and in this phone, "computer-oriented photography" is new to improve the HDR+ setting by combining up to nine different images.
New dual lighting controls offer different slabs for brightness and shadow, allowing users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on machine learning to offer better automatic white balance and improved "Night Sight" night tuning, which is so sensitive that it can capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
In addition to another camera lens, the Pixel 4 Soli introduces a "electric chip student" on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense movements so that users can skip a track, turn off timer, put an alarm on a nap, or turn off the phone's sound by waving a hand.
All Motion Sense calculations are performed in the device rather than connected to the Internet, and the same applies to an improved Google helper, as the technology giant now emphasizes shortening response time and improving user privacy protection.
Google's continued focus on making full use of its mechanistic capabilities has also resulted in a new voice recording app that transliterates audio live without sending data to the Internet.
The app is currently only available in English, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadia, a game forum in the cloud to be launched on 19 November in the United States, but yet yet to be announced a date for Australia.
In addition to new Pixel phones, Google also introduced a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and a second-generation Google Pixel Buds hearing tool.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing tools, expected next year, are completely wireless and possess an audio adaptation that listens to the environment and constantly adjusts the sound to match that for the clarity to be the greatest.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing tools are completely wireless and adjust the volume to the noise around you.
Google also announced an upgrade of its interconnected Wi-Fi home directs to the Nest WiFi line with a special bone along with many basic sites working collectively to improve wireless connectivity within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will adopt the Nest name, doubles its predecessor's drag and adds a built-in microphone and loudspeaker to use the Google helper in each base station in the home.
It goes on sale in Australia on 5 November, costing 399 Australian dollars for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or $549 for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but a new $79 Nest Mini improves the sound quality by doubling the bass and has received built-in muraling.
All Google smart speakers will receive new call system features for communication between devices in the home as well as the ability to call Nest Mini outside the home via the Google Home app.

Stang hunter "slove throw beer bottle at seal" in Devon
A standout hunter threw a bottle of beer into a sale when he disrupted the fishing line, according to a charity.
Images taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay seem to show a man on a rock throwing an object towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey sealer was hunting when the pole hunter emptied out of a bottle and threw it into the animal's back.
Kenny called this "horrible and inconsiderate behavior".
He said he was picking up trash at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning along with other people in the seal protection society Seal Project when he witnessed the attack.
"The cell tried to get into the fishing line," he said.
“ The pole hunter stretched the beer, drained the bottle, and threw it into the seal.
"The bottle landed on the back of the seal and he swam away."
Kenni said that "luckily, seals were sturdy animals" but that the seller had simply been doing what was inherent to him.
"By throwing a glass bottle at him, you're stopping him on his hunt," he said.
The Seal Project Society said that this was "not a unique case" and that it had recently received "many reports of this aggressive behavior".
The society's Facebook entry states that its volunteers collected 12 bags of debris in the gathering at Hope's Nose on Sunday and that "many examples of anti-social behavior" had been seen.
All seals are protected under the Veterans Protection Act, and people are asked to stay away from them.
Rise from the pool of Christ in the Salmon River in the valleys
The first hundred were caught in the Salmon River in the Valleys in the latter part of today.
It was there that Arnór Isfjörður Gudmundsson was acting.
He had placed in a spawn in Kristnapoll this morning, and it was 8 inches (89 cm).
After noon, he again had the option of Kristnapoll and became concerned with a story he had heard that the slow would like to notice that the spawn had caught.
With this in mind, he took Collie Dog's crown and threw over Kristnapoll.
Soon he got taken and as he himself reports.
“ After about five seconds, he cleaned up completely, and I realized it was the meter.
I got a little nervous as I had an eleven pound rein.
Most of the time, I took fish hard, but I had this one for forty minutes.
In fact, he was quite comfortable.
Took a few trips up and down the puddle, but then I got to shore it up, and it was a great feeling.
Gritted away from me the pole and jumped on it.
He measured 102 inches and I double-moulded him," said a cheerful hunter at the fishing house Continental guild in the Salmon River in the Valleys in conversation with Spokesmen.
Arnor is such as no starter when it comes to hundred calls.
That was his eighth.
He contracted such fish in the Mixed River, Black River, Rabbit River, Kjarrá, two in the Long Valley River, and one in the Eystri Rangah.
A fine catch is in the Salmon River in the valleys, according to Arnor.
The hole that finishes at noon tomorrow has 35 salmon and our man has eighteen of them.
Expecting Great Floods Due to Hannah
Hanna, the first Atlantic hurricane of this year, made landfall in Texas, United States last night.
Hanna quickly lost power and became a storm, yet heavy rain has occurred in the area and is expected to be extensive flooding.
It is expected up to 30 inches of rain in one day, but in special locations it could reach up to 46 inches, according to the AP news agency.
In particular, there is a warning of extremely dangerous flash floods that could occur as a result of the rain.
The area where Hanna reached land has been hit due to the large distribution of the new coronavirus there.
In addition, waters have gone ashore, causing damage.
Currently, there are at least 43,700 people without electricity and mass relief centers have been opened in the area.
U.S. President Donald Trump called for the hurricane last night and said it was important that people listen to experts and follow instructions.
The footage captured by AP News Agency cameraman can be seen below this morning.
Houses burned, shops looted and infrastructure damaged
More than sixty are dead and sixty more wounded after an attack in the village of Masteri in the Darfur district of Sudan yesterday.
The attack "was the latest in a series of serious security incidents in recent weeks in which houses were burned, stores and markets looted and infrastructure damaged," according to a statement from the United Nations Office of Humanitarian Affairs in the capital city of Kartum broadcast today.
Abdalla Hamdok, the Prime Minister of Sudan, has issued that security forces be sent to the war-raised region to "protect the population and the crops".
It is only two days since unknown troops in the area killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack.
"The promotion of violence in different parts of the Darfur region is leading to increased upheaval, it endangers the agriculture and threatens people's lives and living bread," the United Nations says.
The conflict in Darfur, in the western part of Sudan, began in 2003 when rebels, most of whom are Arabs, rose up against the governor of Kartum.
Government forces and Arab forces attempting to repeal the uprising have been accused of widespread atrocities, while some 300,000 were killed in the conflict, according to a UN estimate.
Omas al-Bashir, who was deposed as Sudan's leader, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, the new government in Sudan is now trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
TV reporter thanks viewer for noticing cancer lump
TAMPA, Florida (AP) – A television reporter in Florida thanks an attentive viewer for noting a nod to her neck and e-mailing her that she should have him checked.
Victoria Price, a reporter for WFLA in Tampa, took this advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price said on Twitter that she would have surgery on Monday to have the tumor, thyroid, and several lymph nodes removed.
"The doctor said it was dispersing, but not too much, and we are hopeful that this will be my first and last operation," she said.
The viewer emailed Price last month, saying that the nod reminded her of a nod she had.
Price, a 28-year-old investigative journalist, said this week that her television station's slogan was "8 on your side".
"But the roles changed recently when an audience member teamed up with ME and I couldn't be more grateful," Price said.
“ I will forever be grateful to the woman who made a point of e - mailing me, a completely stranger woman.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did it anyway.
Talk about being with a man on a team."
Parts of the Jeronimo Open Space outdoor area closed temporarily after two assaults by coyotes – CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by coyotes near the Oso Creek Trail at Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning, and the route had to be temporarily closed.
Laura Wittmer says she sees coyotes almost every morning and usually tries to avoid them just, but on Saturday morning one came right at her and bit her in the leg.
The walkway has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
The City of Mission Viejo published a tit, stating: "Today, two different parties reported that a coyote had bitten a human being. Mission Viejo's animal welfare service is working on the case in collaboration with the Department of Fish and Animals, and part of Jeronimo Open Space has been closed.Be careful and careful when you are traveling where there are a lot of wild animals."
Wittmer tried to knock the coyote off with a bottle of water.

Protesters of racism collide with police in Seattle
Conflict in Seattle on Sunday between police and protesters against racism ended with the arrest of a number of people, but dissatisfaction crores among the public over U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to send a number of FBI agents into major cities.
Protests against racism and police violence have sparked following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis in May.
Seattle protesters cut to tire cars and broke windows in trailers during the protests on Saturday, which prompted police to declare a state of riot and drain the streets with pepper spray and flare bombs.
The protestors also set fire to trailers in a construction site for an upcoming youth prison.
Police claimed to have arrested 45 people, but 21 police officers had been injured.
The protest march was held in support of the protests taking place in the neighboring city of Portland, Oregon State.
Portland is in the spotlight after Trump ordered highly controversial radical actions by FBI agents, in unthanks to local authorities, who say the police officers use excessive force.
Protests have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, and Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of the state of Texas, one was shot dead in an armed clash downtown Saturday night, police said.
Concurrent with the protests, Trump tallies an increasingly difficult battle for re-election in November, and has adopted a tough law enforcement policy.
