Members of Parliament in Wales fear ‘to look like muppets’
Some MPs were appalled by the proposal to change their title from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This fear was sparked by plans to change the name of the erased house to Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are worried that this will lead to mockery.
One Labour MP said his men were concerned that "it would rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Wales, twp means stupid, and pwp means poop.
A member of parliament from the Camry Pledge Party said all his members were “unhappy” and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his friends were “open to suggestions” about the change of name, but noted that the name MWP sounded very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed in a manner similar to the expression of the letter u in English in the Joachir accent.
The House Legislature Committee, which is currently drafting the change of name legislation, said: “The final decision on each word of description regarding the names of the legislature members’ roles is, of course, the decision of the legislature members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh legislature the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of public consultation on the proposals, in which broad support was given to change the name of the legislature to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the role of MPs (AMs), the committee recommended members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but the MWP option received most support in consultation with the public.
Members of parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to get a consensus could cause quite a bit of headache to the committee chairman, Elaine Jones, who is due to submit a draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the functioning of the legislature, including rules for the removal of members of parliament and the structure of the committee system.
The vote of parliamentarians will ultimately determine the title of their role during legislative debates.
Macedonians go to polls in a referendum to change the country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was set in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, where there is a region called “Macedonia.”
Greece has long claimed that its northern neighbor is a claim to Greece and has returned and opposed Macedonia's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the results.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in the Harlem neighborhood.
According to Mr. Adams, “old neighborhood residents say that in the past there was a bar and a church in every corner.”
“There are no bars or churches today.”
You can understand the disappearance of bars.
“People’s social life today is different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood salon where people visit on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders expect, “Sooner or later, they will find themselves again at the starting point.”
He said the churches would take the place of apartment buildings with shared houses that house people who are not of the kind to help the neighborhoods maintain their unique character.
“The vast majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and this will hasten the closure of these churches, because most of the people who move to these apartments are unlikely to join these churches.”
The two churches were built by white believers before Harlem became a neighborhood with a majority of black people – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The white Methodist community of believers left in the 1930s.
A community of black believers who operated in the area became the owner of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was moved to a black community of believers under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who imposed a boycott on merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but as part of the plans of the faithful under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they ordered the construction of the bell kryon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson the Father and he who inherited his place in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the Kryon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played in the Kryon in July called it by another name: “Cultural Treasury” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ing of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell kryon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who later played the larger kryon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriweather said that the church of St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by local church leaders, others by the Episcopal Bishops.
The meeting, which is the governing body of the community of believers composed of local believers, wrote to the bishops in July a letter in which she spread her concerns that the bishopship would “try to roll the costs” to the assembly, although the meeting was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some of the believers complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
Shark wounds 13-year-old boy in diving for catching lobster
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived to catch lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Ensenitas.
Chad Hummel told the KSWB-TV network in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help and then scoured there with a group to help put him on the beach.
Hummel initially thought it was just a shout of enthusiasm for the capture of a lobster, but then realized that the boy was screaming “I bit!
I've been bitten!"
Hamel said that when he approached the boy, he saw that "all of his clavicles were torn off."
“I shouted to everyone out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was flown to San Diego's Radi Hospital, where his condition is defined as humane.
It is not known which shark species attacked the boy.
Rescue commander Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark had been identified in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a shark of a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Authorities closed access to the beach between Ponto Beach and Swami Beach in Assinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty product market
Sainsbury's starts a competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens dog shop-style passes with professional saleswomen.
As part of a significant initiative to penetrate the UK beauty products market, which turns around <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion a year, and continues to grow as sales in fashion and home products decline, the expanded transitions of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if the trial succeeds, will be added to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty products comes as grocers search for ways to use the space of shelves previously captured by televisions, microwave devices and home products.
Sainsbury’s said the company is expected to double its beauty product supply to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees product lines will also gain additional space with dedicated brand areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The grocery chain is also relaunching its makeup product line – Boutique – so that most products will be vegan-friendly, a feature that is growing in demand among young shoppers.
Fragrance Shop will also review franchises at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croyden, South London, last week and the second in Oak Basketball, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and buying smaller amounts of food every day at local convenience stores requires grocers to do more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Kuppa said the stores would become more like his dog’s stores as the supermarket network tries to fight against the cheap Aldi and Lidl networks with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has added Argos selling points in hundreds of stores as well as a number of Habitat points since it purchased the two networks two years ago, adding that it increased grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the network to revive its beauty products and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the engagement ended after a dispute over how to divide the profits from pharmacies within the grocery stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business operations at 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy network for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
She said Lloyds will play a role in the program by expanding the supply of brands of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Sainsbury’s business manager, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: “We’ve made a shift in the look and feel of our beauty product transitions to improve the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in highly trained employees who will be available for advice on the spot.
Our brand offerings are tailored to every need and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for the purchase of beauty products, challenging the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones Angry After Holly Willaby Cancels <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Star of the TV show Dragons Den, Peter Jones, expressed “rage” after television presenter Holly Willaby cancelled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV
Actually, Willaby doesn't have time for branding their clothes and accessories.
The joint business of the two is similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of the show This Morning announced her departure in a post on Instagram.
Holly Willaby has left Dragons Den Peter Jones furious by canceling at the last minute her participation in the couple’s prestigious lifestyle brand to focus on her fat contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones responded “in anger” when the TV star announced during a stormy meeting Tuesday at his business empire’s headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 – she did not have enough time to devote to the brand of their housewear and accessories Truely.
The joint business was considered similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willabi's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones was flying from the UK to one of his resorts.
According to one source, “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her income in the coming decades.
The decision to leave surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
The company’s warehouses in Marlowe are full of products ready for sale.”
Experts believe that leaving This Morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions as a result of massive investments in a variety of products, from candles and candles to household clothes, and the potential for further delays in launching.
And that could lead to the end of long-term friendships.
Willaby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Cape for ten years.
Wilabi founded Truely with Cape in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the company’s chair in March.
The couple spent the holidays together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s television production.
Willaby will become M<0x26>S's ambassador and replace Annette McPeterlin as an I'm A Celebrity presenter on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We are not responding on his business matters.”
“Tough conversation, and then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he was getting from the news media over statements that some define as “non-presidential” and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said in a voice of “newsmaker.”
"I didn't give up."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after hailing their first meeting in June as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have been frozen.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “response” on the part of the United States to North Korea’s initial disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues with sanctions designed to continue the pressure.
Trump took a far more optimistic view in his rally speech.
“We’re in great shape with North Korea,” he said.
“We’re almost at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
“Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had resulted in positive results – the cessation of missile tests, aiding the release of prisoners and the repatriation of the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his extraordinary approach in talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there,” Trump said in a statement.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have destroyed an island and killed hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has lost their homes, no national disaster has been declared, which is a condition for accelerating international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it’s a little challenging,” Mrs. Sompong said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palo, it is still unclear whether foreign missionaries will be able to pass through the area.
Mr. Sotopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palo to see if international services could contribute more to the aid effort.
In light of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh County, they are rare in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of warning alerts for a tsunami in Palo, although a warning exists, has contributed to loss of life.
Even in the best of times, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has taken Blombok to take care of earthquake casualties makes its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
Improving Indonesia’s weakened infrastructure is at the center of President Joko Widodo’s campaign, and he has invested a lot of money in roads and railroads.
But Mr. Joko is facing funding shortfalls for his bid for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing class tensions in Indonesia as a result of the religious radicalization of the Muslim majority in the country.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in battles between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets – using knives, bows and arrows and other domestic weapons.
Video: Daniel Stridge from Liverpool compares last minute to Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridge received a delivery from Shakiri's office about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal and his team in a 1-0 draw.
He jumped the ball to his left and then turned a kick towards the far beam.
The ball flew high above the floor and landed in the top right corner of the net.
Eventually, the ball landed over the gatekeeper Kapa Arisbalga, who jumped at him, and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to this position, to get to the ball and players like Shack are always playing forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as I could,” Soridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kanta and I made one touch and I didn’t think about it too much and I just kicked.”
Chelsea led 0–1 in half after Belgian star Edn Hazar scored a goal in the 25th minute.
"Blue" forward moved a transfer back to Mato Kovacic in the same game, before turning near the middle of the pitch and quickly running into the half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> carried out a quick ‘tan-go’ maneuver in the middle of the field.
And then he kicked a beautiful cross-kick, which led Hazer into the expanse.
Hazer ran ahead of the defensive and finished with the ball in the top right corner of the goal, with a left kick passing Liverpool player Ellison Becker.
Livepool will face Naples at the home stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people have been reported trapped in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude quake on Friday that caused waves of up to 6 meters, the agency's spokesman Sotofo Poro Neroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palo, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
Police have opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Marseille.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. on John Street when her body was stabbed, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police call people from the area who have seen or heard something to turn to.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I would like to urge anyone who was near John Birkenhead Street and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask any person, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something on a car camera to contact us — because the footage may include information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a building.
Friends who believe they knew the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continued as police announced that they were now delivering messages to relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse had just tried to enter his apartment, but he was told that police banned anyone from entering or leaving the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
Residents are now told that it will take more hours before they can return to their apartments.
A cop sounds telling one person that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was seen in the scene crying.
She goes back and says, “It’s terrible.”
At 14:00, two police vans were spotted inside the scene and another outside.
Several police officers stood inside the scene as they were targeting people in the apartment building.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message on Twitter to <0x40>MerPolCC, to call 101 or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and specify the log number 247 of September 30.
Cromwell’s Parliament Statue Became the Next Destination for Attacks on Memorials in a Struggle around ‘Writing History’
The removal of the statue would be a poetic justice in light of the removal of the Taliban by its Puritan supporters of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England.
But the Cromwell Society argues that Mr. Creek’s proposal is “stupid” and “trying to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that in the current controversy over the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s image outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The breakdown of the statues of the Civil War in England was not done by Cromwell or by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell falls victim to the actions of one of his predecessors, Thomas Cromwell, a century earlier.
Cromwell's impressive representation in the hands of the sculptor Sir William Hamu Thornicroft is a testament to a 19th-century view and part of the historiography of a figure many believe still worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “The Cromwell was perceived by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as one who defended the parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
The question of whether this is an entirely accurate assessment is the subject of ongoing historical controversy.
An indisputable fact is that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation later, and Cromwell is one identifiable figure representing one side of the barrier at the time.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and victory.”
A deadly pig killed a Chinese farmer
Local media sources say a pig has been killed by a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified by his family name Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery covered in blood near a pig house in the market in Lupunchway, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A farmer prepares to inject vaccines to a pig on a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day his cousin found him dead, and found a door to a nearby pig house open.
He said there was a big male pig with blood on his mouth.
A criminal investigation has confirmed that the 250-pound pig attacked the farmer to death, the report said.
“My uncle’s legs were full of blood and crazy,” his cousin, whose last name was Wu, was quoted as saying in Guiyang Evening News.
On security footage, Yuan was seen entering the market on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars to prevent it from attacking more people as police gathered evidence at the scene.
It was reported that Yuan’s family and market authorities were negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this phenomenon is rare, it has been reported in the past that pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused a man's injury.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had a farmer's bracelet in Wales on his tractor until the farmer's wife ran away the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood may be “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They're like naughty kids, very investigative... They don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in large parts of the Southwest.
According to the forecast, hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, hurricane Rosa will bring flooding rains all over northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
The winds in Hurricane Rosa have reached speeds of 135 km/h, i.e. Hurricane Grade 1, and as of Sunday at 5 a.m. East Coast time, the focal point of the storm is 620 km southeast of Punta Eugena, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, an ocean is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean moving east towards the east coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will start pushing deep tropical humidity north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical humidity that will combine with the approaching stream will produce heavy rains in large areas of the southwest of the United States over the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause flash flooding and risk landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rain to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour at different points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall in volumes of 50 to 100 mm is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially in Arizona.
There may be flash floods with conditions that are rapidly deteriorating due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn malls into stormy rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust storms.
The approaching river will bring local rainfall to parts of Southern California’s coastline.
There may be a total amount of rainfall of more than 13 mm, which could result in waste drift and smooth roads.
It will be the first rain in the region this rainy season.
Sprawling tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, and the rain will become stronger and expand later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be severe temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropical remains quite warm.
This often leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday there is a great example of extreme temperature changes across the U.S.
There are temperature differences of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and de Moyne, Iowa.
In the next few days, prolonged summer heat will try to evolve and expand again.
In early October, temperatures will be warm in most parts of the central and eastern United States, moving between 27-31 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecasts show a higher likelihood of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday, on six television networks, the fascinating testimony of the Supreme Court candidate, Bert Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political confrontation continues, with news breaking in the middle of the regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement drafted by Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate legal committee that she was 100 percent sure Kwanu had touched her body drunk and tried to strip her during a high school student party.
Kavanaugh, in an enthusiastic testimony, said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers was even higher than the 20.4 million reported by the Nielsen Index.
Nielsen checked the average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually finds it hard to measure people watching in offices.
For comparison, this is an audience watching on a scale similar to that of the football playoffs or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose comments are passionate about Cavanaugh’s appointment, led out of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
The level of interest remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the main character in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a statement that he would vote for Cavanaugh's appointment, he was filmed by CNN and CBS photographers shouting at him as a group of protesters tried to get into the elevator to get to a hearing at the legal committee.
He was in humiliation for a few minutes while protesters reprimanded him, all of which was filmed live on CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would say more things at the committee hearing.
Broadcasting networks and cables were all broadcast live a few hours later, when the legal committee was about to vote on Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would vote for the nomination only if there was an understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, as the Democratic minority demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Cons and several subsequent senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a majority to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May accused her critics of ‘playing politics’ on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and harming the national internet, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued to attack her ‘Damma Game’ for Brexit, saying that the UK and the EU’s proposal to back each other’s tariffs was “completely dishonest.”
Police arrest Deaton Simpson as suspected of murder of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting in Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for LSU.
A 20-year-old man named Deaton Simpson has been arrested and jailed for first-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and according to police, Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on them, according to WAFB, which is part of CBS.
After Simpson's investigation, police said he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
The bail fee was set at <0x24>350,000, as reported in Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Pathological Institute published an initial report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head and into the neck.
Police gave credit to the Louisiana State Police Task Force for the capture of fugitive criminals, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and civilians in the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the suspect's capture.
Joe Alva, director of athletics at LSU, thanked the region’s law enforcement authorities for “the diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Simms was 20 years old.
The Forward basketball player, who was more than 2 meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
In the previous season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “shocked” and “shocked” by Wade’s death.
“That’s what you’re afraid of all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano emits ashes on Mexico City
Ash ejected from the Popoctetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the mountain cliff increased and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded in 24 hours.
In the center, the number of noises and shakings was notorious.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on suns of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Sochiliko.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital city, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked down central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clash between police and Catalan dilemmas as the anniversary of the independence vote approaches
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police forces to disperse protests, and thousands more joined in protests against the party’s first anniversary of the Catalan independence vote.
A group of masked separatists who were blocked by the police to disperse demonstrations, threw eggs at the police and dispersed paint powder to create black dust clouds on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Clashes also erupted later that day when police were forced to use guns to overcome the protesters.
For several hours, groups of independents who sang “Not Forget, Not Forgive” stood up against supporters of the unity who called “Long Lives of Spain.”
The local press reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained by protesters.
Tensions remained high in independence-supporting areas a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by the Spanish government, but was celebrated by independence-supporting Catalans.
Voters voted by a large majority to become an independent state, although the voting percentage was low when those opposed to secession mostly boycotted the vote.
Catalonian government officials reported nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent ballots across the region in violent clashes.
Independence groups set up camps to stay overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different course.
Narcisse Therms, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope about Catalonia's chance of independence.
“Last year we experienced our best moments.
“I’ve seen my parents cry joyfully because they can vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although the Catalan separatist parties won an important victory, albeit strained, in last December's elections, they struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most well-known leaders staying in exile or in prisons pending trial for their part in the referendum and the proclamation of independence.
Juan Foig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded police support on his phone, said the conflict was triggered by politicians on both sides of the barricade.
“It’s getting worse,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriul Yonkers, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison on trial since the end of last year, announced that he would run for European Parliament elections next year.
“To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regressiveness of democratic values and the oppression that we have witnessed from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonery: Several men arrested after car crashed at home
Three men — aged 33.34 and 39 — were arrested after a car crashed several times at the home of Blondondri.
The incident took place in Belenagar Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. UK time.
Detective Bob Bellings said the gates were damaged as well as the building itself.
It may also be that at some point an arrow was shot from a bow towards the car.
Manga kick gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Manga's first goal to Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who just got into the league, surprised Rangers and coach Stephen Gerard that it was just his second loss in 18 games as Ibrox Club manager.
Dolly Manga's kick was significant because Gary Holt's team moved a level with Hibernian in second place.
Gérard’s team is left without a win outside the top league this season, and will face lead Harts, behind whom she is eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends the loss-free sequence to six games at home, and head coach Holt has not yet experienced a break since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities in front of a poor host.
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before they conquered a goal, when their directness caused Rangers to have different problems.
Scott Robinson burst ahead but dragged his attempts ahead of the gate, and then Alan Lithgoy could only focus his efforts later after sliding in to meet Craig Helgat's knock before the gate.
The hosts were willing to allow Ranger to play in front of them, knowing that they could make it harder for the host team with free kicks.
And that's how the decisive gate went down.
The Rangers received a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block Manga, who made a touch and took a gate from the center of the expanse.
At this point, the Rangers controlled possession of the ball but found that home protection was impenetrable, and the gatekeeper Liam Kelly remained virtually unmanaged.
This pattern was drawn to the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the goal.
Scott Pittnam was paralyzed by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgoy touched another free-kick ball of Livingston.
Cross-balls continued to enter the Livingston square and to be thwarted, while two penalty balls – after a hit on replacement Glenn Middleton, and one on hand – were removed.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9A>Awesome’ from Livingston - Surgery
Alastair Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Amazing game and amazing result from Livingston.
All the players were excellent, and continued to exceed expectations with this upward swing.
Their style of play and the recruitment of the players have hardly changed since their return to the lead position, but a great deal of credit must be given to Holt for the way he has shaped the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holckett was great, leading an incredibly organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell high-definition all the way.
The Rangers were uninspired.
Although they were quite good sometimes under Gérard, they did not meet these standards.
They were missing the final ball – only once they opened up the home team’s defense – and this is a red light to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
A mixed reception for Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
There were smiles and a blue sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO countries.
They were divided on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s acceptance of the European Union.
From there, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an went to Cologne to participate in the opening of a new giant mosque.
Cologne is the city with the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police announced security reasons for blocking 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also voiced their voices, protesting both Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to welcome him in the country.
Opposite protesters reflect the controversy surrounding the guest, which some German Turks praise as a hero, while others condemn as a tyrant.
Car Accident in Daftford: Bicycle Rider Killed in Car Crash
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of Stwood and Evelyn, a bustling road in Daftford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 UK time.
The driver stopped and the wounded were treated by the paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
The collision came after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childer Street, about a mile from the scene on Saturday.
City police said police were trying to identify the victim and notify his relatives.
Instead of barricades and buses on alternate routes, it is recommended that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Injured in Riot
Six guards were injured in a riot in a secure prison for men, the prison office said.
The riot erupted in Long Lartin Prison in Westershire on Sunday around 9:30 p.m. UK time, and continues.
Special officers from a tornado unit were brought to the scene to eliminate the riot, which includes eight inmates and was smashed into one wing.
The guards were treated on the spot due to minor injuries to the inside.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Extremely skilled guards have been recruited to deal with an ongoing incident in Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards were treated for vulnerabilities.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those involved will be handed over to the police and their periods of incarceration may be extended.”
The Long Lartin Prison holds 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison governor was reportedly treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, police dispersed protests were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which guards were attacked with snooker sticks.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drought-shaped areas may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical sink hits Arizona, but this is exactly what is expected to happen at the beginning of next week, when the remnants of hurricane Rosa will cross the desert in the southeast and bring with them the danger of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already declared a risk of flash flooding on Mondays and Tuesdays for West Arizona into southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only ten tropical cyclones remain in the status of a tropical storm or tropical sink within a range of 322 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the Arizona Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated quantities of up to 150 mm on the Arizona Mogulon margins.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated places receiving a total of 50 mm.
For those outside the area at risk of flash flooding, the rain of Storm Rosa may be a blessing because the area has suffered from drought.
Although floods are a serious danger, some of these rains will be helpful because the Southwest region is currently suffering from drought conditions.
According to the U.S. drought surveillance, over 40 percent of Arizona is in a severe drought, which is the second category of its severity," weather.com reported.
First, the course of the Rosa storm will reach the mainland across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa, which still has a hurricane intensity on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugena, Mexico, and has moved north at about 20 km/h.
The storm runs into colder waters in the Pacific, so it weakens.
It is therefore expected to arrive on land in Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico could be heavy and pose a risk of severe flooding.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Total rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm,” weather.com reports.
Rosa will then continue into Mexico as a tropical silver storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning of Tuesday's tropical sinking, which will then continue across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from the Rosa storm, or its remains, is heavy rainfall in Baja California, southwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flash flooding and waste streams that are life-threatening in the desert, and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsmar Norton: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Mid Summer Norton Tras area on Sunday around 04:00 UK time.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remained in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, according to the regime.
The police are asking anyone who may have cell phone footage of what happened to contact the police.
Trump says Kwano “suffered the condemnation and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the outrage and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kwanu had “suffered the convictions, anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, while strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "the people of the United States saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" on that day.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh’s appointment is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the most outstanding legal minds of our time, a jury with an excellent history of public service,” he told a crowd in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important votes in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m actually a candidate,” he said.
“That’s why I’m running everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission to “reject and interfere.”
A senior Republican aide told CNN that the first central procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Senate was expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them drifted by massive waves, crashed on the shores when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesian island of Sulawesi, official sources reported on Saturday.
Many people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palo on Friday, when waves carried at 6 meters (18 ft) crashed on the beach at sunset, drifting many to their deaths and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat woke up yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t immediately escape, and they were a victim,” said Sotofo Porvo Norroho, spokesman for the BNPB, in a briefing at Jakata.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nuruho said, adding that the tsunami had advanced over the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometers (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed the destruction of a large number of houses and shops, curved bridges and corridors and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent shocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
He said the geography of the city, which sits at the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nuro described the destruction as “massive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nuruho said the death toll and damage could be greater along northern Palu, with a 300-km (190-mile) coastline, a region called Dongela, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The media is “completely collapsed and there is no information” from Dungla, Nurho said.
More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its people and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is now a tragedy, but the situation could get even worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was criticized for not announcing that a tsunami had hit Palo, although officials said the waves had arrived while the warning was released.
In an amateur video posted on social media, you can see a man on a high roof of a building shouting hysterical warnings about a tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
The Reuters messaging agency was not immediately able to verify that the photo was authentic.
The quake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut off the media around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending transport planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but the survivors are still desperately in need of food and other essentials.
The city's airport is only open for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's very difficult.
As World Vision personnel from Dungla arrived safely in the city of Palo, where workers sheltered in bunker shelters built in their office yards, they passed through sights of destruction on their way, Mr. Dusbah said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very difficult.
Even as aid groups began the unfortunate operations of shifting the gears of disaster assistance, some complained that they had been prevented from reaching the Palu of highly experienced foreign aid workers.
According to Indonesia’s regulations, funding, supplies and people from other countries can only begin to flow if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
“This is still defined as a disaster at the provincial level,” said Olia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we will be able to open the door to international aid, but this status has not yet been declared.”
As the second night falls on Palo after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing people cling to the hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that illuminate the grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman buried under wreckage for two days, with her mother’s body next to her.
Gandon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paratrooper team, has trained two missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the hotel saw see, among them Mr. Mendge, were his disciples.
“Old in the parachute field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gandon recalled how in the hours after the news of the hotel collapse saw a widespread paratrooper community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palo, who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray-critical sign, instead of the pair of blue marks.
“I think it means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves Take <0x24>26,750 During ATM Filling at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brinks employee who filled an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver dumped an ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to bring more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind a Brinks employee and stole a purse with money to fill in an ATM.
A witness saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not detail how many people were involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changed His Name to Yes
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to yes.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity that was known as Kenya West."
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the nickname as his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on the TV show Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He is replacing singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
In addition to the shortening of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most common word in the Bible, and the Bible means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
It moved from Kanye, which means the only one, to just “Ye” – simply a reflection of the good in us, the bad in us, or the confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He's one of several famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Daddy or Didi, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brotherly Love.
West's former partner, Jay-Z, also switched between versions of his name with and without a mapping and letters.
Mexico's president has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's elected president, Anders Manuel López Obrador, has pledged never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Teltloco Square, “Never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
Army forces fired at a non-violent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial support to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its AI funding.
As China’s AI activity increases, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in research, says Kai Fu Li, an AI researcher who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His remarks come after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even as the U.S. government has no official AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be the number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Duplicating the funding could double the chances that the next major AI achievement will be achieved in the United States, he told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was released this month in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of China's most prestigious Sinovation Ventures, which invested in the full-fledged company.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first-ranked player in the United States, and later served as a senior manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s branch in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency’s Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects, and asked when it would be next, to help identify future visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government grants, he told me.
“It’s not China that takes us the top researchers in the academy, it’s the business companies that do it,” he told me.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited stars from universities in recent years to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think a green card should be automatically offered to doctorates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s state council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations in the U.S. Department of Investigators’ Allowances, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, aimed at bringing together industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a special artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an artificial intelligence initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it is currently investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. legislative initiative designed to create a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change its name to “North Macedonian Republic,” a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name is a claim to Greece and vetoed its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two countries signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would damage the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the number of voters would meet the minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the ballot paper is as follows: “Are you in favor of joining NATO and the European Union upon accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that it is a price worth paying so that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the dissolution of Yugoslavia, can join bodies such as the European Union and NATO.
“I’m here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgesbeka in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs said they would obey the results of the vote to make it a voter.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority will be required.
The state election committee said there were no irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, the percentage of voters was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of voters came to vote.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Jose Tanevsky, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorika and his son Dusko are labelling their ballot in Stromita, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in a referendum in Macedonia on the country’s name change, opening the door to joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Skopje House of Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and chairs in front of tents erected by those boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join an upright leader, not through the entrance of the servants,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian Union.”
Prime Minister Zayev said NATO members would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
“I believe the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zeev said after voting.
He said a positive outcome would be “securing our future.”
A poll released on Monday by the Institute for the Study of Politics of Macedonia showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – less than the required percentage.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma TV, found that 57 of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote “yes.”
For a referendum to be successful, the percentage of voters must be at least 50 percent plus one.
The referendum’s failure would be the first major loss of pro-Western government policy since it took power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player, Sergio Aguaro, navigates through Brighton’s entire defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling broke Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguaro seemed to occupy the gate lightly.
The Argentine pioneer received a delivery in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defensive players before breaking into the open field.
At this point, Aguaro found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before gaining several more shields on the Brighton Expansion Border.
And then he kicked a left turn, and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch on the floor to hand the ball back to Aguaro, who, with the right foot, defeated Brighton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with a ball on the right side of the net.
“Aguaro has foot problems,” Manchester City’s director told reporters.
He played for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that he scored a goal at the moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Capacity the initial advantage of rivalry in the Premier League.
The gate arrived at the 29th minute.
Aguaro got the ball deep in Brighton's territory during this.
He sent a great cross ball along the right flank to Leroy Sanna.
Sanna drifted the ball before leading Sterling to the far corner.
The Blue Sky player pushed the ball into the net just before he slid out of the field.
Manchester City will face Oppenheim at the Champions League home game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rain-Neckar Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Schrazer wants to play spoiler against the Rockies
With the Nationals coming out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But a highly competitive surfer hopes to win Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the playoffs for the Rockies, which lead one game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West League.
The Rockies had at least a place for an open ticket with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but had not yet promised themselves the first place at home.
“While we’re playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the viewers and the second team will probably play at the highest level at any point I’m facing this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to deal with it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starter for Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to let the Sarzar serve in such a situation.
Chazar, which would be his 34th start, held a Bolpan training on Thursday and will serve on his rest day - Sunday.
Washington's right-wing pitcher has an 18-7 track record with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikes in 220 rounds 2/3 of the season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly hinted at the situation around his elected Supreme Court candidate Bert Cavanaugh, as he talked about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the midterm elections.
Everything we did was at stake in November.
Five more weeks to the most important election of our lives.
“It’s one of the most, most of all, I don’t run, but in fact I do run, and that’s why I run everywhere and struggle for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible group of radical Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And if we're determined to take back power by whatever means it takes, you see the vileness, the vileness.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they need to run over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “reject and interfere.”
“And you have seen this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and evil, scornful and dishonest.”
He referred to the minority leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, in her name, prompting high-level public contempt.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I waited until—it was really bad body language—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a pluralistic place.
She is intolerant to those who express their opinions.
When momentum activists in my local party branch voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a row of Labour MPs to be told that they are not welcome – and only because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to censor me criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe – ironically speaking, similar issues to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous party leaders.
The East Nottingham Liberal Party meeting on Friday said: “We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday evenings were exactly the same.
For the moment, this is not the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of “kinder, gentler” politics has long been forgotten, if ever begun.
It turns out more and more that the Labour Party lacks tolerance for different views, and every opinion is judged by its acceptance of the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy was elected party leader, when colleagues who once thought we were sharing a similar political view began to expect him to turn around and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – whether on national security or on a single European market.
Every time I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there comes immediately an abusive stream of social media reprimand with calls for impeachment, condemnation of the center’s politics and calls that I shouldn’t be in the Labour party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more lucky than many of my colleagues, because the remarks that are directed at me tend to be political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flurry of racist abuse every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become routine.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are already the same pluralist place, and with every decision to “distrust” or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more problematic.
Over the past two years, many have advised me to keep my mouth shut, not to be so loud and then I’ll be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, shocked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that caused my public school classroom to nearly collapse, I have been looking for a way to fight for better social services for those who need them most – whether as a local councilor or a Kosher in government.
I have never hidden my political opinions, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political positions and the issues of my disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling toward a Brexit that will harm our families, our businesses, and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But to be honest, the one message I have is not for the momentum movement in Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of repulsion or political utility will deter me from acting in a way that I believe best serves the interests of all of you.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Unbeaten Air to the Top
The last two fresh ones have slightly tilted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayer deserves to win the fun and wonderful game of the Scottish Premier League today.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the teen.
Ultimately, it was their best defense, as well as taking much more risks, playing for the home team, and coach Peter Murchi had all the reasons to be happy.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far, and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose Group said, “Lair deserves all the credit, they took better risks than us.”
Grant Anderson's Tray in the 14th minute, converted by Fraser Clemo, put Air in the lead position, but a yellow card to Scottish player Rory Hughes released for the game by the Warriors allowed Melrose to score points and Jason Baggott caught Tray unturned.
Kalimo raised Air's lead with a felony, before actually halfway through, and then converted Trey Solo to 17–5 in half.
But Melrose opened the second half well and the fresh Patrick Engerson, who was converted by Goth, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Rodrick Knut, who was taken away in a handbag, and starting with the game's renewal, Air increased the gap through Staford's Trey Macdwell, who was converted by Clemo.
Replacing Air Blair McPherson's captain, Melrose once again took advantage of the other man with Bruce Colvin's unhomer Tray, ending a sequence of tremendous pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Stroan Hutchinson received a yellow card for attacking Calimo without a bullet, from the penalty line, McPherson scored a touchdown behind Air’s advanced goalkeeper.
Kalemo Hammer, as he did almost again from the game's return, after Kyle Roy S. kicked David Armstrong's box and sent Gregory Henry's wing to the House Team's sixth Tree.
Still Game Star looks ready for a new restaurant career
Still Game star Ford Kearnan appears ready to move to the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and starring with his old comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next season would be the final season of the show, and it appears that Kirnan is planning a life after Krilling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kirnan was looking for ways to get into the flourishing restaurant business in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia Unfindable Sea Hopes Court Opens Its Path to the Pacific
Marines patrol the Navy headquarters covered in blankets of ships in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue-sea flag.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon carry the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to reclaim him.”
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict over resources is still alive – as is the longing to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may have been at a high point for decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course he expects from a positive attitude to the future,” said Roberto Clazdilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will fall into the decision of the International Court on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia's demand after decades of fragmented talks, and Chile will be obliged to negotiate the granting of sovereign access to the Bolivian sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic native president, Evo Morales, who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year, hangs a lot of the decision on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But commentators believe there is no great chance that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and that even if it decides in favor of Bolivia, it won’t make much difference.
The U.N. court in The Hague has no authority to grant Chilean territory, noting that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes only six weeks after hearing the concluding arguments suggests that the case was “not complicated,” but Faz Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia’s claims, the past four years may even have weakened them.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current administration in Bolivia,” Zarata said.
Morales’ war rhetoric has eliminated any remaining goodwill from Chile, she said.
“Sometimes Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Velzza, a representative of Bolivia at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a “great opportunity to open a new era in relations with Chile” and “end 139 years of disputes for the benefit of both sides,” he said.
Clazadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the naval issue as a political lever.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Stop is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says denuclearisation won’t happen unless it can trust the US
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Jong, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ree Nam on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the brink of reopening diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that reached a dead end more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a “dream in Esfamia” to think that continuing U.S. sanctions and resistance to announce the end of the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel.
The U.S. is afraid to agree to a declaration without North Korea taking significant steps to denuclearize.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are interested in a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear arsenal, which it likely sees as the only way to protect its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris unveils the new trend with giant hats found on its way to luxury stores everywhere
We will find a solution for anyone who wants to expand their hat collection or get complete sun protection.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of huge, crazy head coverings for their SS19 collection, in a fashion show that stunned the style scene of the Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats have obviously taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have brought their extraordinary works to the fashion showroom.
Valentino’s highlight was an excessive beige hat decorated with broad feather-like margins that covered the heads of the models.
Other dismantled-sized accessories included decorated watermelons, a magician hat and even pineapple - but they were not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of strange masks – check out on time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks included stitched lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than Hot Cutter.
One piece mentioned a snorkeling mask and glasses, and another looked like a melted ice cream cup.
And for those who want to continue with a fashionable, huge statement of dimensions – their time has come.
Fashion interpreters expect the giant towels to make their way to luxury stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after La Bomba, the half-meter-long straw hat that is seen on everyone’s head, from Mariana to Emily Ratajkowski.
Label the cult behind the very impracticable hat that flooded social networks gave rise to another great work on the track – a sea key bag almost as big as that of a swimsuit model carrying it.
A burnt-colored relaxation bag, with loose strands and a white leather hand, was the highlight of Jacqueline La Riviera’s SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and big sea bags to arrive in luxury stores next summer – because the design made a huge impression and it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edwards: Essential Language Skills for Citizens of the World
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with an additional set of outstanding exam results, which is reinforced by individual and team success in sports, art, music and other areas of practice in the community.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, careers they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a personalized curriculum, we discover that modern languages continue to gain popularity as a desired field of study in the school.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
Speaking to a man in his own language, it enters his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the recent tests this year, you can see that languages are at the top of tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high A score.
Data collected from the 74 schools members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved a high A score in Mandarin, as did 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and adolescents will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, the field of languages as a subject of choice is considered to be at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Council on Employment and Qualifications found that 17 percent of the reasons employers cited Cody for filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, incrementally, language skills become an essential need to prepare students for future careers.
Faced with the rise in language requirements for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in the world of globalization.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant future advantage thanks to this ability that lasts a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries is automatically a person in a position of advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at a sufficient level for a conversation, and French was the only language in which there was a double-counting percentage of speakers, 15 percent.
This is why it is important to invest today in teaching languages to children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught in it.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages considered the most important for Britain in the 20th century, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever the child’s area of interest, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in the independent schools, with a team of teachers specializing in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed in any future.
It is impossible to deny today, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this fact should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to the children of Scotland.
It's the hour order.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron is expected to play the Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans waiting to see LeBron James play for the first time at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But it's not yet determined how many minutes he'll play.
“This will be more than one and less than 48,” the Lakers official website said.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six preseason games.
“At this stage of my career I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump opens with a flurry of election rallies tonight in Willing, Virginia.
It is the first of five planned Trump rallies this week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting for confirmation of his appointment to the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 19:00 East Coast time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to hearings this week of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who have become tense about accusations of inappropriate sexual behaviour and the postponement of a week's Senate vote while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the main goal of this rallies is to help Republicans facing challenging elections in November gain some momentum.
President Trump’s campaign office said the goal of these five rallies next week was to “incentivize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president is ready to visit as many countries as possible as he enters the crowded election season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters, who asked to remain anonymous.
The rally, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Stadium in Willing, could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania" and draw media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
It will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to try to improve his situation in the polls,” said Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team is willing to fight to keep hope for Sunday’s singles game
After three one-sided sessions, the Sunday afternoon quartets may be exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
The driving rod of momentum is a completely invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this one.
So where do they think the momentum is now?
“They had a six-point advantage and now it’s four, so you can see it as a bit of momentum,” said Jorn Speit at the end of a day.
Europe has four points ahead, with 12 more in the game.
But the Americans, as Spivet says, feel like they have a little wind in the sails, and they have a lot to cheer, not the last of them in the shape of a Spive, and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them boasts three out of four points.
Safit was deadly from Hetty to Green and he is a leader in his personal example.
The shouts of joy became stronger as his round continued, drowning Pat critically to win all-square game four and Thomas dropped two after two.
His fate for winning the 15on game won a similar alarm, the kind that shows he believes the American team still has hope.
“You really just have to dig deep and worry about your own game,” he said.
That’s all we have to do for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a seal.
The only players with more points than a dock and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionably leading story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but charming pair of Europe are four out of four and they are all sympathetic.
"Mollywood" was the only pair that didn't hit the shoot the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back at nine on Friday morning.
The same round, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic crowd, establishes the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Mullinary to sign the potential European victory with the sun set on the Le Golf National.
Better both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European fame.
Doll and Tasson Webb Simpson finished with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was robbed with Alex Norén.
Bogey and two doubles in the front nine brought the Spaniards and the Swedes down to a hole they weren't getting close to getting out of.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
It's fascinating to look at the four balls and the fours because of the interactions between the pairs, the tips they give, the tips they don't give, and the way strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has led significantly towards the last day, but this fourth session has shown that the U.S. team is filled with a spirit of battle that some, especially within the U.S., have questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in a good position for the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday with a score of 10-6 against the United States.
Inspired pair Tommy Fleetwood and Warnesco Molinary led the change with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, raising the gap so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side players, who tried to defend the trophy they lost in Hislatin two years ago, dominated the Americans who missed the four-ball game this morning, bringing the series to 3-1.
The U.S. players showed greater resistance in the games, winning two games, but were unable to close the gap.
To continue to hold the trophy, Jim Purik’s friends need eight points out of the only 12 games.
Fleetwood is the first European troll to win four points in a row, while he and Mullinary, who were nicknamed "Mollywood" after an extraordinary weekend, are just the second pair to win four points out of their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball games, they proceeded in magnificent harmony together to defeat the weakened Woods and American novice Bryson Detchambau with an even more pronounced 5 and 4.
Woods, who drags himself across two games on Saturday, has shown random outbursts of excellence, but so far he has lost 19 of the 29 games of the four balls and fours, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning’s four-ball games, returned to join Henrik Stenson in the four-ball games to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka – ranked first and third in the world.
However, not everything went easy for European players in the pleasant weather and the soft wind blowing southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a narrow 2 and 1 win over Spain's John Ram and Ian Polter in the four-ball games and later returned to defeat Pelter and Rory McElroy in the 4 and 3 games, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have the team returned from a negative four-point gap to the only games, although as a cup holder, Purik’s people only need a tie to keep the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday appears to be beyond their reach.
“North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally without trust.
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday at the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that there was no chance that the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong-ho announced at the annual U.N. General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill steps” in the past year, such as stopping nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to no more developing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see any consistent response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure about our national defense and under such conditions in no way will we unilaterally dismantle ourselves from nuclear weapons at first.”
While Sherry reiterated North Korea’s familiar complaints about the U.S.’s opposition to a “graded” approach to denuclearization that North Korea would be rewarded with step-by-step measures, his statement seemed important in that it did not reject the threshold of denuclearisation, as North Korea did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint announcement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work towards “the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump promised to protect North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also opposed calls to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on “nuclear disarmament first” and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even opposes “an end to war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can cause us to kneel is a dream of gathering people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the aggravating sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ree did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president stressed in a speech at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jia-in in the past five months, adding: “If the other side of the issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the US, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end.”
However, Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that a North Korean missile attack on U.S. soil was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea’s “complete destruction,” praised Kim for his courage to take steps to denuclearize, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearisation.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a set time frame for that, adding: “If it takes two, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia said the U.N. Security Council should reward North Korea for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the enforcement of U.N. Security Council sanctions must continue with determination and unimpeded until we achieve a final and verified nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for its ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for placing “gangster demands.”
North Korea has promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear facility if the United States takes "conforming steps".
He said Kim had told him that the "conforming steps" he was interested in included security guarantees Trump had made in Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches participants how to sleep more, trying to fight the expanding mascot culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
Academic research has found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea as far as the basic principles of how to take care of themselves are concerned.
Charles Keissler, a professor of sleep sciences at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham <0x26> Wimmens Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, one girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this just now, in my final year of school?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep – which surprised me,” he told the Telegraph.
The course, delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall condition.
Paul Breyer, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and senior director of health services at the university, said the university decided to open the course after finding out that students had severe sleep deficiency during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sports clothes and books - to get explanations about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a sleepwalking routine.
In another part, participants are told how a persistent lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, if interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of students overnight.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” added Prof. Zizler.
He said the culture of pride about “sleepless night” still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are causing the problem of sleep shortage to grow.
Caring for adequate sleep, and good sleep quality, should be every student’s secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep moves the brain to starvation, so we’re hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemical and physics biology, helped Professor Zizler design the course after attending one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course illuminated his eyes and motivated him to encourage a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar teaching program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Tzizel recommended that students examine the possibility of setting a clock that will ring when it’s time to go to bed, and not just for the hour when you have to wake up, and be alert to the harmful effects of blue light that emit electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt the dance rhythm and thus cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's decisive goal for Gerard's players
The Rangers suffered another loss in a game outside when Dolly Manga caused Steven Gerard's rebel players to a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox players hoped to win their first overseas win since the February 1–4 victory at St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerard's second loss in 18 games as manager and left the team behind by eight points after the Harts running at the top of the Scottish Premier League.
Manga attacked seven minutes before halftime and the uninspired Rangers didn’t seem to compare to Jesus.
As the Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and right behind the Hibernian by gate.
He may be waiting for another double Rangers after the line Callum Spence was in need of treatment for a head injury after an object was probably thrown at him from the stand.
Gerard made eight swaps for the team that passed through Air to the semi-finals in the Cup at Tefred.
Holt, on the other hand, rose with the same 11 Livingston players who took a point from Harts last week, and he could have been satisfied with the way his players beat opponents in any situation.
The Rangers may have controlled the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They almost won in the second minute when Manga sent a ball to Scott Petman who kicked Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep free kick of Keegan Jacob found Captain Craig Elect, but his shield Alan Lefty could only kick out of Cora.
The Rangers did, but there seemed to be more hope than confidence in their game in the last quarter.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have ruled in his favor after a quarter-hour game when he and Stephen Willis clashed, but Judge Stephen Thomson waved against the Colombian.
The Rangers were only able to kick twice to the goal in the first half, but Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily braked Lasana Coulibaly's kick and Obi Ajaria's weak kick.
While Livingston's opening at the 34th minute was at odds with the way the game was conducted, no one would deny that they deserved it at least for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs’ deep free ball.
Scott Artfield did not respond as Declan Gallagher transferred the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the ball cool by handing it to Manga for a simple finish.
Gerard acted in half when he replaced Coolibli with Rain Kent, and the exchange had an almost immediate effect when the extreme/wing inserted a ball into Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the guest team to play exactly the kind of game she liked, with Lithgoy and Hecht continuing to send long balls.
Holt's team was able to increase the lead in the other stages, but McGregor was well positioned to prevent Jacobs' attempt before the label was knocked out of the corner.
The Rangers' replacement player Glenn Middleton later had another claim against Jacobs, but Thompson ignored it again.
Almanach: inventor Geiger Counter
And now stand from your Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geyer developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger Counter.
Since then, the device has become a pillar in science, but in 1950 it has also become a pillar in pop culture thanks to the film "Bells of Coronado," in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as two strange cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this thing?"
Rogers: <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>This is a Geiger Counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on the headphones, you can really hear the effects of radioactivity on the atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Oh, man, it's really cracking now!"
Geiger passed away in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live after him.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and eliminate them
Vaccination teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, and changing cells in the lab.
The cells can then “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and then they are injected back into the patient.
Experimental vaccines show promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, ovarian cancer disappears for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Betsada, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “motivates the development of a number of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, visibility and colorectal cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to attack cancer cells has succeeded in treating a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West broke out in a reprimand speech supporting Trump, with his head as a MAGA hat, after his appearance at the SNL.
It wasn't very well received.
Kanye West responded with contempt at the studio during a confused show on the Stargate Night Live show, praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he will run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, "Guest Town," during which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he broke up a reprimand speech against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I talk to white people who say, ‘How can you love Trump, is he racist?’”
“If I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The episode of SNL began with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the reprimand speech was not broadcast on the show, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to roll on West in the posting.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had been criticized behind the scenes for the hat he was wearing.
“They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go to the stage with that hat on your head.’
They attacked me!
And then they said I was in a dark place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, “Do you want to see the dark place?” They said he was wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to show love.”
His remarks were at least twice scorned by the audience, and it seemed that members of the SNL team were embarrassed, Variety reported, and one of them told the newspaper: "A deep silence has fallen in the entire studio."
West joined the show as a last-minute substitute for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West stunned many when he performed the song I Love It when he wore it as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by conservative group leader TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: thank you for not succumbing to the crowd.”
But the actress, Hunter Foundation, wrote on Twitter that West was simply “be who he is and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>But I chose not to reward (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “art”) which I think is an effort and propagation of an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“We too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now the “entity that was once known as Kenya West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi, also known as Puff, Papi, and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, had the name Snoop Lyon, and of course the renowned musician Prince changed his name to a sergeant and later to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in custody.
The suspect is expected to appear in Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Kitt Rinton is acclaimed for the role of John Snow from the Swords of the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the protagonist Macho, saying that such roles on the screen often convey to young children the message that they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another Game of Thrones star, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted to being “very upset” about handling the issue.
“Personally, I feel very upset right now – where did we go wrong about masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men in their growing age, from the point of view of the problem we are witnessing now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity, due to the very masculine characters it presents.
He continued: “What comes from the inside and what will we learn from the outside?
What do we learn from television, and on the street, that makes young children feel that they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think that’s really one of the biggest questions of our time—how do we change that?
There’s no doubt that something went wrong for young men.”
In an interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any sequels or derivative series of Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, saying he was "final with battlefields and horses."
Beginning in November, Keith will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s play True West, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his brother the robber.
The actor recently discovered that he sees meeting his wife Rose as the best thing that ever happened as a result of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in the series, so that way the series gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on,” he said.
Rose played the role of Yigerit, the object of John Snow's love, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have the disease, according to official health officials.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been infected as a result of having sex, which is a change compared to the past.
To date, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to official health officials in China at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection as a result of sexual intercourse is a burning problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality ceased to be illegal in China in 1997, but it was said that discrimination against LGBT people was widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of infection are the result of not using adequate protective measures in these sex relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ensured universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a man on her team leaked information about a Republican senator and denounced "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information about three U.S. senators on the senators' Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democratic senator has estimated that the allegations are being distributed by websites and “extremely right-wing” critics.
“Lies, lies and more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
According to reports, the information included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing before the Senate Committee on charges of improper sexual conduct against Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was linked to Waters’ office and published information about a member of Waters’ team, according to Hill.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie,” Waters added.
“My staff member – whose identity and personal information has been disclosed and whose security has been compromised as a result of these false and erroneous allegations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and utterly false.”
Waters' announcement quickly drew criticism on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>This indicates that she does not have the temperament required of members of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t react with anger.
He must not react with discouragement.
He must not question the motives of the accused.
He needs to be calm and calm.”
Fleisher appeared to compare Waters’s response to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics have accused of looking too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
“Great if it’s true,” he wrote on Twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said her office had contacted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials about these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered,” she continued, “and that they will be prosecuted for all their destructive and dangerous actions against my team members.”
Johnny English 3.0: A Weakly Spy Parody starring Rowan Atkinson
Nowadays, it’s common to look for meanings about Brexit in any new film with a British perspective, and it does seem to fit into the revival of the action-comedy parody in the Johnny English series – which started somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Is an ironic self-slapping about how worthless we are going to become the new export opportunity of our country?
In any case, Johnny English, who has the open-eyed and rubber-faced face, has had another chance to mess things up – and his name symbolizes more than anything that is a wide-ranging comedy for cinema viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the silly English agent, who, despite his strange pretense of a slippery glow, looks a little bit like Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and plenty from this guy who contributed a single note to the charm of the fireworks in the opening text of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the mysterious international traveler portrayed by Atkinson in Barclaycard's forgotten television commercials, which leaves chaos behind.
There's one or two nice minutes in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I liked the part where Johnny English approaches the helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the propeller blades ring for a moment on his helmet.
Atkinson demonstrates his comic physical abilities, but humor feels oddly weak and unnecessary, especially since the "serious" type of spy movies like 007 and Mission Impossible in themselves now include a comic component.
The humor feels like it’s turning to children rather than adults, and for Johnny English’s insanely failing adventures are less brilliant and focused than Atkinson’s silent film-style jokes.
The film begins when a great danger threatens Britain.
A computer hacker has hacked into the British spy supersecret internet, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the fear of the chief agent – a small role unfortunately for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a proud and combative prime minister who is already suffering a complete collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best to play the role of Theresa May, but has little to do with the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy is exposed, she'll have to bring someone back from retirement.
And it says Johnny English the proudly self, who is now employed as a schoolmaster in a prestigious institution, but gives unofficial lessons on how to be a covert spy: some good jokes here, when English offers a school-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his former assistant Lamud Buff, who is again portrayed by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a man who is married to a submarine command, in the role of an annoying class queen on whom Viktor Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service Knesset to a terrible entanglement are back in action, with Molem Pam-Patal a beautiful Ophelia that Olga Korilenko portrays.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously captured by the charms of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems – the vicious Jason Walta playing Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin with their Odyssey, which is more of a fancy of two clowns: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant; they create a paralysis when they smuggle themselves in the fancy yacht of Volta; and English sets an absolute anarchy in his attempt to use a virtual reality kit of his inner home to get to know her.
There is no doubt that all efforts are made to lead to the final sequence, but despite the kindness and naughtyness, it has a sense of television for children.
Pretty medium level.
Like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice with his talent?
The Labour Party denies it is preparing a plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan that the British will work four days a week - but be paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company managers to transfer the savings as a result of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers in the form of an additional day of rest.
I mean, employees will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same salary.
Sources said the idea was “fit” for the company’s economic agenda and its plans to steer the country for the benefit of its employees.
The congress of trade unions supports the transition to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sandy Times: “A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day week of work is an aspiration that fits the Party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the Party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day week of work during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day week of work is not the party’s policy and the party is not considering it.”
Labour Finance Minister John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s party conference to outline his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from ‘faceless managers’ and ‘price-breakers’ in service companies.
The Treasury Minister’s plans also stem from the fact that current shareholders in water companies may not receive their full refund because the Labour government may make “reductions” on the basis of misconduct.
He also confirms that plans are in place to bring employees to the boards of directors of companies and create “collective funds” to transfer 10 percent of the capital of private-sector companies to employees, which will bring in annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy told the TV show "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kwanu changes their mind
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings could convince the Republicans to withdraw their support.
On Sunday’s 60 Minutes, reporter Scott Peeley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina party colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said before the hearing, I said I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and the blame came up, and I said, ‘Did you do it?’
He was decisive, determined, conclusive."
Graham's vote, on the other hand, appears to have been engraved in the rock.
“I’ve already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it’s going to be a big charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Burt has denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
“And no man she mentioned could verify it.
The thing's 36 years old.
I can’t see how something can change.”
What is the World Citizens Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
The New York Restoration will date the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with the most impressive list of stars to appear and an equally impressive goal of ending world poverty.
The World Citizens Festival, which is being held for the seventh time, will bring tens of thousands of people moving to a big lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event – to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert island must complete a series of missions, or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, calling or other significant ways to help raise awareness for an end to poverty.
But how much success did the festival really achieve, with only another 12 years ahead of it to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free ticket to a concert really a way of convincing them to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of “climaticism” – people who feel like they really are influencing by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the World Citizens’ Organization says it has documented more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, pushing for a variety of different goals.
He said these actions have helped motivate world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than <0x24>37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its operations, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already begun distribution or fundraising.
The group estimates that the funds allocated to date have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and actionists committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to help end undernutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from “World Citizens.”
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and ‘citizens of the world’ like you, we can turn malnourished social justice into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Allman told the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced an allowance for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional intervention.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, “What makes you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?”
“Citizens of the world” replied: “It will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the big movements ahead of us of civil rights and opposition to apartheid, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monet are among some of the shows to be held at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Fornes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces for “marine quarantine” to delay Russian energy exports
“If necessary,” Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, according to interior secretary Ryan Zinn, quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zainab argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – which is being made, it is important to mention, at the invitation of the legitimate government – would be an excuse to spread to new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States, with our fleet, is able to make sure that sea routes are open and when necessary to blockade to ensure that their energy sources do not reach the market,” he said.
Zinki turned to attendees at a Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they are indeed the same.
“The economic possibility for Iran and Russia is, more or less, leverage and exchange of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “one trick pony” because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to boost its thickened natural gas exports to Europe, while replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump has made Berlin a Moscow “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which should double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion square meters, is an economic project alone.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s resolute opposition to the project is motivated solely for economic reasons and serves as an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to put pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Secretary Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position has received a strong response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industry Organization (BDI), the leading organization in the German industry sector, has called on the United States to keep a distance from the European Union’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempff, head of the German Industry Organization (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren “Seriously Considering” the 2020 Presidential Run, Massachusetts senator said
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was “seriously considering” the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed his intention to run for president during a meeting in the city of Hollock, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and for that, it’s time for a woman to take the lead,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential race.”
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the city council meeting, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren strongly criticized Trump for appointing Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters don’t think she should run for the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’s “potential” voters said the senator should not run for office, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent voted in favor of running for the senator’s presidency.
The poll showed that there was more support for the run of former governor Duval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of his run against 48 percent who opposed it.
E-mailed figures from the Democratic Party that came up in the context of a possible run for 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, according to AP reports.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s been going through since he came back, allows me to identify with families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and with some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back,” she told the audience at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back stiff, they come back and wonder if what their fellow soldiers and airmen and all the other military personnel have given to the country is honored."
He was arrested on a day-to-day basis in the city of Vasila, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, obstructing the reporting of the case of domestic violence and drunken possession of weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasila police.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of refusing to grant asylum to victims fleeing situations involving gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and county have filled out a “Court’s Friend” statement on Friday in Washington to support the challenge of asylum seekers’ policies, the NBC reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Rights Association in August was not disclosed.
She said her partner, “violent sons, gang members,” had abused her but U.S. government officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state advocates described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, of which many applications for political asylum are being made in the United States, as nations dealing with many problems in terms of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 BIA Immigration Appeals Council resolution that allowed undocumented migrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “is ignoring decades of state laws, federal and international laws.”
“Federal law requires that all discussions regarding asylum applications depend on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and the barrier laid down by the new policy violates this principle,” the statement said.
Lawyers also argued in the statement that the policy, which prevents immigrants from entering, is damaging to the U.S. economy, as they tend to become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary work,” they said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more political asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“The political asylum is open to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
The goal of the political asylum was never to ease all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo, while the death toll doubles, in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become more difficult from moment to moment.
“There is a very tense feeling,” said 35-year-old Risa Kosuma, a mother of a baby with a fever in the centre of Lamphoun in Palo, the devastated city.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Every minute the ambulance brings bodies.
“Clean water is rare.”
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, drifting between water-sponge objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dewey Harris, who suffered from back and shoulder fractures, lay outside Palu's military hospital, where they were treated for strong sub-shock shocks that continued after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt the violent earthquake shocking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the wreckage of the wall, I think,” Harris told AP, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they’re in a safe place.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper released a four-page ad in the U.S. daily, while aggressively promoting the benefits of U.S.-China trade, U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the addition of the Chinese newspaper China Daily, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, saying China rejected it.
Trump’s accusation that China tried to interfere in the U.S. election marked a new phase, according to U.S. official sources, in Washington’s escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to publish ads for trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war in which each country raises and compares tariffs on imported products from its rivals.
The tariffs, which China raised as a retaliatory measure early in the trade war, were intended to hurt exporters from countries like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, U.S. and Chinese experts said.
Terry Barnstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a former governor of Iowa for many years and an important exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Bernstad wrote in an opinion article in the Sunday edition of the De Moine Register, “enhanced the acts of bullying by posting ads in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America’s precious tradition of freedom of speech and press, and publishes a paid ad at the De Moine Register,” Bernstad wrote.
“On the other hand, in the newspaper stand on the streets of Beijing, you’ll find few opposition voices and you won’t see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers has evaded the proposal to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans dislodge women's votes ahead of midterm elections with Cavanaugh incident, analysts warn
While many Republican Party leaders stand by and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault charges, analysts warned they would see a counter-reaction, especially from women, during the next midterm elections.
Feelings around the issue were particularly vivid, and most Republicans officially expressed their desire to move forward in the voting process.
“This kind of stuff cannot be turned back,” Grant Rieher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School of the University of Siracusa, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
He said he doubted that the last-minute efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republican Party) to open an FBI investigation would suffice to appease angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they are not going to forget it tomorrow nor in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive movement MoveOn.
On the morning of Friday, protesters shouted "November is Coming!" as they protested in the hallway of the Senate, while Republicans controlling the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue advancing Kavanaugh's appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a Mic report.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation levels will break new records,” Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they’re already high; they’re right.
But they can be higher, especially among floating women in the suburbs and among young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite their dissatisfaction with the president, often refrain from voting.”
Even ahead of Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault on the candidate, analysts argued that a response could be made to whether Republicans would continue to advance the confirmation of the nomination.
“The appointment has caused Republicans a serious complication,” said Michael Steele, chairman of the former Republican National Committee, earlier this week, NBC News reported.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or if Kavanaugh gets the nomination, but also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps vote Democrats.
The Americans, however, seem to have some disagreement as to the extent of their belief in Ford and Kwanu’s testimony, with a slightly higher support for Ford.
A recent YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed for sure or likely to believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed for sure or likely to believe Kwano.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kwanu lied with certainty or probability during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flick, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford as well as those made by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kwanu had assaulted her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate revealed his gender during a party they attended during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
Global Internet Inventor Plans to Start a New Internet Network to Overcome Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, launches a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the man who has become a legend in the world of technology, is a company that will develop Solid, the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows its users to choose where their data will be stored and who people are allowed to access the various data types.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create a personal online database or POD.
The database can include a list of contacts, lists of actions to perform, a schedule, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify will be available all in one browser at the same time.
What distinguishes the personal online database is that only the user will decide who can access the information and what type of information can be accessed.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, Inrupt will find the resources, process, and capabilities to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Today, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers from around the world will be able to create distributed apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not discussing with Facebook and Google about their agreement or refusal to introduce a complete change, which would make a complete nightmare in all of their business models.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to “provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built at Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he founded the network's standardization organization, W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in a debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m especially optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: An event to commemorate the clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Anglican clergyman to have won, as a warrior, the Victoria Cross during World War I was observed at an event in his hometown 100 years after the victory.
Vice-Champion and Reverend Bernard Vann, won the Victoria Cross on September 29, 1918 for his participation in the attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never known to have won the highest British honour.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rasdan, North Hampton, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that revealing the stone exactly 100 times after his grandfather won the Medal of Honor was “incredibly symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion and crossed the San Canton Canal through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns.
He then rushed to the line of fire and the "Great Knights" led the line forward before he hastened to take control of a submachine with one hand and knocked down three of the battalion.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to compare to, but something that arouses humility in me.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also placed a stranger after the parade, which led the Royal Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said he feels “a great honor to take part in the parade” and added “the heroism of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people.”
Fans of the combined martial arts stayed up all night to watch Blator 206, and instead received Pepe Pig.
Imagine you stayed up all night to watch Baltor 206’s action and eventually watching the main event was denied to you.
The San Jose show consisted of 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was aired live during the night on Channel 5 UK.
At 6 a.m., just as Jagard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the battle, British viewers were shocked when coverage changed to Pepe Pig.
Some of them were not impressed by the change after staying awake until the early morning hours, especially to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the transition to the children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
“This is a government regulation that states that at 6 a.m., the original content was inappropriate and therefore they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Balator, when asked about the broadcast.
<0xE2><0x99><0xAA> Peep Pig, yeah <0xE2><0x99><0xAA>
Blator's president, Scott Cocker, said they plan to work on their schedules to include British viewers in the future.
“I think that when I think about the rebroadcast, I think we can probably figure it out,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won’t be able to solve the problem until Sunday in our time zone, i.e. on Monday in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition, many text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time this is not going to happen.
We're only going to have five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to give the fans more and we just exaggerated.
It's a matter of unlucky."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘slow down’ because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley, the Olympic water jumper, said that as he grew up, he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation—but that feeling motivated him to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t know until he reached middle school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, directed by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope."
He also said that making him a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The old-fashioned program's host, Christy Young, has been on sick leave for several months.
In his appearance as Laverne's first show star, Daley said that he felt the rest of the rest as he grew up that "it was socially unacceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, “Until today, the feeling of inferiority, and the feeling of difference, were real things that gave me strength and strength and allowed me to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out what his sexual orientation was.
The man who twice won the Olympic Bronze Medal became an e-mailed leader of the LGBT community campaign and used his participation at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on other countries to legalize homosexuality.
He spoke openly on the subject because he felt lucky to have been given the opportunity to live open and without consequences and wanted to give others “hope”.
The triple world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “catched me by surprise.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, last year but said the age gap had never been a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age,” he played at the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, said it was hard to find someone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a white man named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that his “every point of view” had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it’s all about ‘I need to win a gold medal’,” he said.
You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was about to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you wouldn’t be here to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand while his breath stopped and only when he really stopped breathing and died was I finally aware that he was not invincible,” he said.
A year later, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life — diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there was no feeling better than that,” he said.
It was also what inspired him to choose his first song – Proud of Heather Small – with which he identified during the preparations for the Olympic Games and still makes him a duck skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, British Summer Time.
Michaelson disappointed in performance and went down to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. golfer Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to upgrade his performance so that the event does not become an unhappy milestone.
Mikaelson, who participates in the 12th bi-annual event and sets a record, went down to the bench according to Jim Furrick’s decision during the foursomes and two-ball matches on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was his practice in games with the United States team, Michaelson, who won five major tournaments, spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half working on his game in the margins in hopes of correcting the ill that he suffered from.
Even at the height of his career, the actor’s performance was downwards and elevated. So, 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for La Golf National, where long grass tracks are usually not tolerant for stranded punches.
And if the competition itself is not deterrent enough, Michaelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, raced against the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with starter Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who lost four points in the first 12 games, were to succeed in the early stages, Michaelson's game could have been decisive.
Furrick expressed confidence in his player, although we didn't expect him to say anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on my back, wrapped his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furrick said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He was a member of the Hall of Fame and added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it developed and that's how we thought we should continue.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players."
Michaelson will break Nick Paldo’s record with the highest number of matches at the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be how his career ends at the Ryder Cup, which has never really matched his personal record peaks.
Mikaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half, though Furike said his presence added some intangible advantages to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, smart, he likes to make fun of people, and it’s fun to be in the dressing room with him,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see it.
There’s a lot more to it than the game itself.”
European Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows the big advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of the Ryder Cup's singles game could change badly.
The Danish player started his career at Valdrama in 1997, when his matchmate, Grandpa Ballesteros, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, which he almost lost when he crossed the finish line with a slight advantage and won 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I keep reminding myself that we had a big advantage in Valderma; we had a big advantage in the game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the Valderma where we won but with a small advantage,” Bjorn said after watching a 5–3 victory in the 2018 tournament, both on a Friday and yesterday, which led to a 10–6 win over a female golfer.
“History will prove to me and to everyone on the team that this is not over.
We have to give it all tomorrow.
You have to get out of the way and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, to try to win the trophy, and we need to focus on it.
“I’ve said all along, I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of those on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn was pleased with his players’ performance on the hard golf course and added: “It’s important to me that we never get too late when it comes to golf.
Tomorrow could be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and it's completely different.
It’s a pleasure to be on the track when everything goes well, but when you’re there alone, then your full ability as a golfer is put to the test.
And that's the message to the players: you have to make the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he needs to make the best of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, rival team captain Jim Furrick will expect better personal performance than his players, compared to their performance in the matches, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furrick himself knows both the winning side and the losing side during the important final days of such tournaments, having participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, when the European team miraculously won the final game, as recorded in Miracle at Medinah.
“I remember every word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players for the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to succeed in the early stages, as you saw in Brooklyn, and as you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum moves to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield games.
“We’re preparing our team accordingly and bringing the guys on track according to the feeling that we have, you know, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and will face Rory McElroy in the top game, with Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
“I chose the team in this order because I think he will be able to get us to the end,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said, referring to the selection of his only players.
Germany's new warship has been denied yet again.
Germany's new fleet frigate was due to be accepted in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War warships, but was postponed at least a year due to damaged systems and reduced costs, local media reported.
The arrival of Rheinland-Pfalz, the ship leading the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate line, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a report by the newspaper Di Zit quoted as a military spokesman.
The cruise ship was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying issues after supplies closed the door to the ambitious project.
All four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class cruises, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the Bremen-class aging frigates.
They are expected to include powerful guns, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries, as well as evasive technologies, such as reduced acoustic, infrared and radar signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the significance of repeated delays is that the innovative ships – which should allow Germany to send troops overseas – will become obsolete by the moment they enter service, he said.
The F125 was headlined last year when the German navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to build a ship after its delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of critical “software and hardware deficiencies” that rendered the warship useless for the use of a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fleet would be operated by about 120 sailors – about half of the crew used in the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship has a dramatic overweight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons and is twice as heavy as ships of a similar type used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty software, the price tag of the entire project – which also includes the training of the team – also becomes a problem.
It has reportedly reached a shocking height of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) – above the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that fascinate the newest frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartletts, head of the German parliament’s security committee, confirmed that the Navy is now “wasting vessels capable of deploying.”
The official source said that the problem was accelerating and increasing over time, as old ships were taken out of service but not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed his regret that it was impossible to join the Navy with any of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates.
The National Fund of Scotland Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
A new study in a mansion in the Scottish Mountains seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt their food.
It is hoped that the findings will further illuminate the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
Scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will follow bats and European phones, as well as brown Dubanton bats and long-eared bats in the Inverio Gardens in the Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key sites around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
A specialized sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and which of the species is responsible for them.
Next, a map of the living areas will be drawn to create a detailed picture in the order of size of the surface of the landscape, of their patterns of behavior.
Rob DeWar, a conservation consultant for the National Foundation of Scotland (NTS), hopes the results will reveal which living areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of the management work of living areas, such as the creation of prairies and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably during the last century.
They are under threat from development and construction work, which affects the nestling and loss of living areas.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be a risk, and this is true for certain fly traps and chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits, bat ears are more useful when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo detection techniques to detect insects and identify obstacles to their flight route.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 760,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
She has 10 skilled experts, who conduct surveys, nesting tests and sometimes even rescue.
The organization also established the first and only bat-dedicated reserve in the T'Rib Mansion in Dampriys and Galloway, which serves as home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Mansion Manager David Thompson said the mansion was the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Bethriv we have a great area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right living areas.
But many things are still unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other assets will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of testing the bats before carrying out maintenance work within the properties, as the unintentional destruction of a single inhabited nest could destroy up to 400 females and puppies, and could also destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and the killing, harassment and disturbance of bats or the destruction of their nest areas are prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish clerk at the Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said: “We have a lot more to learn about our bats and about many of our species we just don’t know the state of their populations.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges While Lawyers Prepare to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him “Fake News” and said people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The pioneer of the Portuguese team and the Juventus team was accused of raping an American woman named Katharine Muerga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He later allegedly paid her <0x24>375,000 to keep her silent about the incident, Dr. Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, turned to his 142 million followers on Instagram in a live video a few hours after the allegations were made public and called the reports "Fake News".
<0xE2><0x99><0xAA> No, no, no, no, no.
“What they said yesterday, Pike News,” said the actor who won the D’Or balloon five times.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and everything’s good,” the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have referred to as “unacceptable privacy suspicions,” Reuters reported.
Attorney Christian Schritz said the player would seek compensation for “deleted damages in an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mirga reportedly returned to the actor's room and allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Miorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her he was a "good guy" in "99 percent" who disappointed in "one percent".
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but they agreed.
Myorga also claims that she turned to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an off-court settlement because she felt "horrified by acts of revenge" and feared "to be humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the arrangement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer moved to Italian club Juventus for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will regret losing car manufacturers forever
The UK will regret losing its status as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, UK Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota Britain’s interview with the BBC, in which it said that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Branston, near Derby, was “worrying.”
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the case of a non-deal Brexit could increase jobs.
The factory in Branston, which produces Toyota’s Oris and Eventis models, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% are exported to the rest of the EU.
“From my point of view, if the UK leaves without an agreement from the EU at the end of March, we will see the end of production at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Branstone.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how it will affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Viguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call ‘supply chain risks’ in the event of a non-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “exactly timely” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, delivering British and the rest of the European Union to make cars on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, and sector officials say it could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota will not be able to hold stock worth more than one day at a factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so production will be discontinued.
Clarke said Theresa May’s “Checkers” program, which details Britain’s future relationship with the EU, is “precisely calibrated to prevent these tests at the border.”
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement, as I said, not only to enjoy success in the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The evidence from Toyota and other vehicle manufacturers is that the possibility of continuing the successful use of the supply chain that we have so far is absolutely vital.”
Toyota did not say how long it would last, but in the longer term, it warned that the additional costs would damage the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to layoffs.
Peter Tzubalaris, who has worked in Branston for 24 years and is president of Unite at the factory, said members of the union were increasingly concerned: “In my experience, if jobs were reduced, they would never be returned.
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, which depends on many, could be “delayed another week” as the battle for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of investigations by the president.
The gossip in Washington has been talking for months about whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of carrying a wire to record talks with Trump and causing the president to be deposed through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he arrived at the White House and was reportedly about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for the day with Trump, who stayed at the time of Rosenstein’s arrival at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not to” fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate legal committee hearing, in which Quanu and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, and again rejected the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date for the meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, I can see another week’s postponement given what is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I’m always happy to update the press.”
Some reporters will challenge this ruling: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the frequency of the briefings did not stem from the "reflection" of television reporters, although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they are taking a stand."
She then proposed to increase the direct link between Trump and the press.
“The president holds more questions and answers than any president before him,” she said, adding without quoting evidence: “We checked the numbers.”
Press briefings will still be held, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this in many cases, and you have seen that we have done it in many cases in the last few weeks, and meetings that will allow us to talk to the President of the United States will replace the press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences during visits.
His only press conferences are rare.
This week in New York City, the president may have demonstrated the reason for this, in a loose and sometimes odd performance to reporters gathered on the spot.
Health Minister writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland and addresses Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health wrote to staff from the European Union, who are employed by the National Health Service of Scotland, to express the country’s gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jean Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already pledged to meet the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its distributed public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the exit have continued, and it is moving towards the decisions expected in the fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this period can be very worrying for all of you.
That’s why I wanted to go back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the team, regardless of their citizenship.
Fellows from all over the EU and around the world bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee University's back shield tiger group, Christian Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury from a 31-27 loss on Saturday to the Vanderbilt Commodore team, Mike Organ reported from Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the University of Tennessee team, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
“He went to the edge of the field and just collapsed there,” Reid said.
The trainers and the medical team gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field and then put him on a stretcher and took him for further examination.
A University of Tennessee clerk told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been transferred to surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/scope of the surgery" and that the University of Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is an athletic student and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He participated in a total of five rectifications before leaving the game, raising his total rectifications for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK and additional revenues will be used to help homeless people, according to the new Conservatives plan.
The move will neutralize Corbyn's move to attract new voters
The cost of stamps tax will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Treasury expects tax to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of stamp tax when they buy an asset in the UK - the extra revenue will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
The move appears to be an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s move to attract young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on high-income people.
The stamp tax will be imposed on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the increase in revenues will strengthen the government’s move to help the old ones under difficult conditions.
The payment, which comes in addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels on secondary housing and real estate investments for rent, may reach a height of 3 percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new London-built properties are purchased by foreign residents, a situation that increases prices and makes it harder for people who first purchase a property to place a foot on the housing ladder.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax cut to help young people buy a first house.
He blamed large construction companies for the price of expensive properties, because they hijack land but don’t use it, and prompted Mrs. May to abandon tariffs on affordable homes and repair Britain’s “degradation of housing.”
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms proposed, including overseeing rents and stopping “blameless” evacuations.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my term to the restoration of the British dream – the very essence of which is that life is supposed to be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair for people not living in the UK, as well as companies based in foreign countries, to be able to buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
“The dream of becoming homeowners has become too distant for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping under difficult conditions is too realistic.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland"
Sanderland manager Jack Ross said his "ultimate aspiration" was to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is delighted with the Northeast Resuscitation Challenge, which is currently third in the first league, three points ahead of the ranking.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after leading St. Mirren back to Scotland's first place in the last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I once played an international game and that’s it,” Ross told the BBC Sportsound show.
But when I grew up, I watched the Scotland team play a lot of Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that drew me back.
“This opportunity will only come if I manage the team.”
Former Sanderland executives include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Foyer, and Paolo di Canio.
The former manager of Alois Athletic says he was not afraid to come after such established names at such a large club, after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>For me, success will now be assessed according to ‘Can I return the club to the Premier League?’
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, there’s no doubt that it belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success story here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross began his management career only three years ago, after a period as assistant manager at Dumberton and 15 months as the team coach of Hearts.
In the next stage, he helped Eloah out of League 3 and raised St. Mirren from the bottom of the abyss to her championship status in the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his acting career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Polkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably a real junction,” he recalled, about taking command of Alois.
“I really believed that the management position was right for me, more than the game.
It sounds strange because I played fine, earned reasonably, and enjoyed some reasonable records.
But an actor’s career can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still deal with them when it comes to stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I’ve always wanted to run and now I’m doing it, and I’ve never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult.”

The perfect time for a beer pint is at 17:30 on Saturday, is in the survey
The summer heat wave increased the earnings of British pubs struggling for their existence, but caused pressure on restaurant networks.
Groups of pubs and bars enjoyed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, the data showed.
Peter Martin, of CGA Business Consulting, who collected the data, said: “The significance of England’s continued bright weather and longer-than-expected participation in the World Championships is that July had a pattern similar to that of June, with pub revenues rising 2.8 percent harder, but restaurants suffering from the pandemic.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant trade seen in June only worsened in July.
Beverage-focused pubs and bars recorded the strongest performance, with revenues in the restaurant business growing higher than in the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although their condition was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent over the month, and food sales fell by 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM analyst for entertainment and hospitality data, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of sporting events or important social events are the most important factors when it comes to the outdoor entertainment market.
It’s not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, though a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year would be particularly painful in addition to half of all the fixed costs.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse moment for food-focused businesses, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring about a relaxation of what they need so much.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.

One in five children has social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey revealed that one in five children – some only 11 years old – have secret accounts on social media that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a growth in fake Instagram pages
The news has raised concerns about advertising of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “headline” account that they show to their parents.
One in five children – some only 11 years old – creates social media accounts that he keeps secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts — a reference to the photo-sharing site, Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the advertising of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clean “head” account to show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old teenage daughter’s secret account found that she was asking others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Association of Independent School Administrators (HMC) found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half admit to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Elyde Doyle will serve as the "Voice of Athletes" on the Board of Scottish Athletes
Elyde Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of the Scottish Athletes as external director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated lightweight athletic athlete and chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who guide the sport industry to benefit from its rich international experience over the past decade.
“Ilyde has been greatly honored by the Scottish, British and World Athletics Community and we are confident that the Scottish Athletes will benefit tremendously from bringing it to the board,” Beatty said.
Doyle said, “I’m excited to be a voice for athletes and I hope I can contribute and really help guide sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now regularly used as a BBC commentator, lost his ability to walk after suffering a passing stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, re-learned how to walk and now performs agility and reaction speed exercises!
“Thank you for the encouragement messages!”
An Advertising Advertising for Milk Pumps Comparing Mothers to Cows Online
A dairy pump company has filed opinions online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cow milk.
To mark the launch of the pump that is supposed to be “the world’s first quiet and wearable dairy pump,” tech company Elvie has released a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a barn full of straw to the sounds of a song that included words like, “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you can’t see a tail” and “in case you haven’t noticed it’s not pencil, it’s my breasts.”
The chorus goes on and says, “I suck, I suck, I feed the babies, I suck, I suck, I suck my girls.”
But the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed responses from viewers, and many said it sheds light on the “atrocities” of the dairy industry.
It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within a few days after the weaning,” she wrote.

Another response said: “Traumatically traumatizing the cow and the calf alike.
But hey, why don't you use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who are entitled to keep their babies?"
Another comment said, “An advertisement is completely cut off.”
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "too funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
The ad was a little crazy, but I was referring to its content.
“It’s a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another comment said: “This is a funny ad for mothers who pump (often in their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feel like ‘cows’.”
It’s not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women discover that they all danced with the discreet pumps inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women, who use a milk pump, say they feel like cows.
But Elvie’s pump is completely silent, without pipes and wires, it secretly fits into the breastfeeding bra and gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while pumping.
Anna Bellarin, a partner and responsible for the early childhood development department at Mother, noted: “Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In comparing self-expressing women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milk pump and all the challenges in the spotlight, and show in an entertaining way, which can be identified, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will offer.
This is not the first time Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the track for designer Martha Jacobowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children are quietly moved to tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children in detention has risen even though the number of monthly crossings remains relatively unchanged, one of the reasons being that the Trump administration’s discourse and policy has made it difficult to transfer children to sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and were afraid to risk their ability to remain in the country by applying for child responsibility.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would have to hand over fingerprints, and these years would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Authority, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship for minors without supervision.
The commission later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of sponsors or their households are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That’s why we continue to pursue these people,” Mr. Albans said.
In order to address the solutions for the children more quickly, officials introduced new laws that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days after the previous regulations, shelter workers reported.
Many will appear via videoconferencing, instead of face-to-face, to present their arguments for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for release will be deported quickly.
The longer these children remain in sponsorship, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, which could lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, said shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months.
Counselors say these fears are being reinforced in larger facilities such as a tournament, where signs of a child’s difficulties are likely to be neglected due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving the children to the city of tents without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to break up with friends could exacerbate the trauma many are already facing.
Syria Tells US, French and Turkish Occupation Forces to Withdraw Immediately
In an appeal to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu’mel also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country’s war is now in its eighth year.
Moallem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext that they were fighting terrorism, and would be “treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the rally.
Mogame insisted that the “war on terror” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would “continue to fight this sacred battle until we clear the Syrian lands” from terrorist organizations and “all illegal foreign presences” alike.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and consulting with Kurdish and Syrian forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 fighters on the territory of a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said the conditions for their return were good and blamed “certain Western countries” for “spreading irrational fears” that kept refugees away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with their return,” he said.
They are politicizing an issue that should only be humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid will not be sent to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces with Russian support on the province, where three million people live.
However, Mohammad stressed that the agreement was “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that the military action would focus on jihadist fighters, including fighters from the victory front linked to al-Qaeda, who would be “destructed.”
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee, composed of members of government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mohammad laid conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the panel’s work should be limited to “examine the provisions of the present constitution,” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberals obviously hope, the impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
It will undoubtedly be the “most dramatic ending in the history of the presidency of all time”!
Right now, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, record time viewing percentages have doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at peak hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC-broadcast “Rachel Maddow Show” reached the top of the rating rankings of cables with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
“It’s the fire that people are attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neil Barr, executive producer of the ABC drama series The Designated Survivor, which deals with the secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Nell Scobel, an old comedy writer and author of "Only the Funny Parts: ...and some hard truths about infiltrating into the Hollywood Men's Circle" has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked.
“He said, ‘Because he made me laugh,’” Mrs. Scobel told me.
Chaos has the value of entertainment.
Of course, unlike all other TV shows, the plot lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Rue vs. Wade judgment, whether migrant families will be able to reunite again and the health of the global economy.
Changing a channel or ignoring it is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go beyond being an educated citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours in a panel of Danish experts using Bob Woodward's Secret Informant as a source for the book Fear, Jacket Pullman's Pullman and Jacket Pullman's Pullman on the <0x24>15,000 for Paul Manafort's "Full-Up Clothes"
I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“Part of what he does, which makes him feel like a reality show, is that he feeds you into something every night,” said Brett Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show, “History for Sale,” about the team that switches to Trump’s show and the daily turns in the plot (the war with the N-L League).
You can't afford to lose one episode or be left behind.
When I got to Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of Kawai Island, but he closed down to watch MSNBC, recording CNN at the same time.
He failed to break up, not when Brett Cavanaugh was preparing to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is at stake.
“I remember the times when we did all these crazy shows before and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right.”

Funds from outside sources flood the race for the nearest midterm elections in Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is facing a flood of funds, thanks to the reorganization of the congressional districts, which led to a two-member race for the same seat.
The county, a suburb of Pittsburgh whose borders have recently been redrafted, placed Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won his seat in another county, in a special election last spring.
Lamb ran against another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th district, which largely overlaps with the boundaries of the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the division of the former provinces had misappropriated the results in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial blow in the campaign between the financial weapons of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in the March special elections, which were widely watched, for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat has belonged to Republicans for more than a decade, and President Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators saw a slight advantage for Democrats.
The U.S. considers punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and then withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already met in Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varla in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his associates expelled Trump’s management team.
Foreign Ministry officials have decided to return the heads of the US diplomatic delegations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama in response to “the latest decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” said Heather Newerett, a spokeswoman for the ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which was estimated to have received <0x24>140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, which included drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in economic aid and targeted visa restrictions, could have hurt a Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials rejected an urgent conference that was supposed to focus on safety and economic prosperity as a continuation of a similar conference last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from arriving in the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials made clear their desire to promote the conference, ending all punitive measures against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now due to address the participants of the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance the administration attaches to it, diplomats said.
And three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new messages or harsh penalties from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal discussions, provided they remain anonymous.
Their explanations were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the government, who also spoke anonymously.
Studying History
The next obvious thing may come from Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s alleged obstruction of investigations, on which there is now substantial evidence in public records.
Mueller is reportedly referring his investigation to the question of whether Trump’s campaign has cooperated with Russia in its attacks on our election campaign.
If congressional control changes, Trump will find himself accountable to this body, just at the moment when he prepares to stand again before voters, and perhaps even a jury.
There are a lot of questions here that start with “if” and I don’t intend to argue that Trump’s fall is inevitable – not even for his European counterparts.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect the length of time that the struggle may last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West would oppose him and support the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the years of slaughter that occurred as a result.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the march of democracy cannot be stopped, accelerated, or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that last year he had proposed to secretly record the president and raised speculations about his inappropriateness for the presidency.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>How do we respond if the F.B.I. investigation into Bert Kavanaugh, which was recently requested, is incomplete or unfair – or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections and appoint a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we fail these tests, democracy will fall into a long winter nap.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, who also once occupied the magnificent house I had.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light Saturday candles on the same table carrying the hook cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Durans from the Rangers optimistic about the Rapid Vienna Conflict
The Rangers host Rafid Vienna on Thursday, and know that a victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw against Viriel in Spain earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from the G in the European League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Durans from making the first appearance in the season until a 2-2 draw with Viriel, but he believes the Rangers could use the result as a leap for better performance.
“It was a good point for us because Viriel is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
We went out into the game with the belief that we could achieve something and we got a point.
We could have won in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were out of freeze in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they have achieved a good result in their last game, but with the audience behind us, I’m sure we can push and achieve a positive result.
“The last year has been really hard, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there’s a good feeling about the place now.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind and succeed.
Women stay awake because of this fear about retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about it with their family members.
About half of respondents in the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to conduct the conversation,” said Holly Schneider, vice president of Nationalwide Life Insurance.
You can do it the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for treatment if you don’t express your wishes long before the time has come.
Help your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get treatment, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Share with your financial adviser: The adviser can also help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Your funding options for long-term nursing care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a sum of money to help cover your expenses, or self-insurance with your capital – as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Find an early solution to legal struggles on this occasion.
Find and map out a health care force, a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and make sure that your professionals are fulfilling your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also consider signing a power of attorney when it comes to your finances.
Choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions in your place and ensure that you pay bills if you are unfit.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your adult parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?
Please specify these details in the written program to be prepared.
“The financial side is not the only important point, but who are the doctors?” Martin asked.
What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare the plan.”

Police described the shooting, which took place at about 2:30 p.m. on British summer time, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the man who attacked him.
The injuries he suffers are not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo, official sources said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disaster caused the disconnection of the media networks and the official officials responsible for the aid could not obtain information from Donagala County, an area in northern Palu that was closer to the source of the 7.5-magnitude noise.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some facts about Palo and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province’s Sulawesi Center, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami and earthquake hit it.
Donagala is a county stretching over 300 kilometres (180 miles) of coastline northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the province, an administrative area within the province, was estimated at 299,200 people in 2017.
The main sources of income in the province’s economy are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal region of Donagala.
Another important source of income is nickel mining, mainly concentrated in Morwali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palo and Donagala have been hit several times by tsunami waves in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donagala.
A tsunami also hit the western Donagala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, known for its seismic activity and has been permanently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's northern Sumatra province, on December 26, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the deaths were found to have died in Sumatra.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit South Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that shattered the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 hit the area near the city of Padang, the provincial capital of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mantaway Islands, opposite Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pidi Jaya Batcha district, causing devastation and panic, as the local people were remembered for the devastation following the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause the tsunami in this case, but more than 100 people were killed in collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's eldest son, the governor of Alaska and former vice president, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Vassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a mine tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-soo Private facility under a <0x24>500 warranty, according to KTUU TV.
According to the network’s reports, he appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself “definitely innocent” when asked to blanket his claims.
Palin is charged with three type-A offenses and could be jailed for a year and fined for <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with a type B offence, according to which he could be sentenced to a day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that hit Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been cut off and the rate of losses is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos, distributed on social media, showcasing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami crashed on the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Cyclone Saipov, a New York City terror suspect who killed eight people, a rare punishment not enforced for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out a bike-track attack on the side of the South Manhattan West Side Highway, and ran over pedestrians and cyclists who were hit by him in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the Statement of Intention for the Death Penalty, filed in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty can be imposed on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury made 22 counts of charges, including eight counts of extortion-assisted murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack demanded “significant planning in advance and intentionally,” the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as “depressive, cruel and sick.”
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Saifolo Habibbolevi<0xC4><0x87>“ Saifov caused damage, damage and loss to their families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Claves, Ann-Lore Dekkad, Darren Drake, Ariel Arleigh, Hernan Pruitchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damein Pignocoe.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York claimed the death penalty in the case occurred a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not express remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about his actions, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired by the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police, he also asked to hang an ISIS flag in the hospital room where he was staying.
He claimed to be innocent in response to the 22 counts indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were “disappointed of course” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of a confession of guilt that would lead to life imprisonment without the possibility of being released would only extend the duration of the trauma of these events to all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Prague Should Be In Charge of Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Prague vowed to “recruit the People’s Army” today during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former leader of the UKIP said politicians must “feel pressure” from the aerosceptics — when a member of parliament from Theresa May’s Conservatives claimed he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a march in Birmingham that Britain was “already out” at this point if Prague had served as Brexit secretary.
But May’s challenge, to reconcile the very divided lines of conservatives, has been underscored by the joining of conservatives who support remaining in the European Union for a different anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to leave her compromise plan, the Chequers, on course despite attacks by Brexit supporters, stay supporters and the European Union.
The Allies insisted that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite counter-reactions - and force the Erosects and Labour to choose between its agreement and chaos.
Bone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leave team in Solihol that he wanted to say goodbye to Crackers.
He claimed that Prague should have been accepted as a member and in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out at this point,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will defend Brexit but we have to say goodbye to Brexit.
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: “We did not fight the two world wars to be enslaved.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Boone has revoked the claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also marching and told reporters: “I’m simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The chakra program is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular among our party and our activists who took to the streets and elected us in the first place.
Please, drop the chakras and start listening.”
In a critical message to May, she added: “Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Prague said at the conference that politicians should “feel the pressure” if they are about to betray a resolution adopted in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We won’t let you evade its execution.’”
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience: “I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel pressured.
“We call on the people’s army of this country, which has given us the victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud UK.”
At that moment, the supporters marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour conference downtown.
A handful of activists were blown up in ‘Conservatives against Brexit’ posters after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked at the opening of the Conservative conference about the security problems they suffered with the party app.
“These are people who are telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technology possible for an agreement like Canada plus, for a border crossing without friction and for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
<0xE2><0x99><0xAA> That's totally ridiculous.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘seriously consider’ running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is “seriously considering running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a city meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for midterm elections in November against Republican Jeff Dell, who served as co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of rumors that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The event in Hollywood, which took place on Saturday afternoon, is the 36th meeting with voters in a meeting format at the City Hall since Trump took office.
One of them asked if she was going to run for president.
Warren said: “It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government and for a woman to take the lead.”
Arrest in LSU’s shooting to death
Police in the Louisiana capital, Baton Rouge, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wade Simms was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a person who was seen in the footage.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot and killed near the University of Southern University campus early in the day.
“Wade Simms suffered a gunshot wound in the head and eventually died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wade tried to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene with a gun and singing on Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge County Police.
The junior, nearly two meters tall, played in 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes world title after team goals gave him a victory over Sebastian Votel
It was clear, from the moment Voltaire Bottas qualifies for the next level before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that Mercedes's ranks would play an important role in the race.
From the first moment, Bottas had a good start, leaving Hamilton almost alone, defending his place in the first two rounds and inviting Votel to attack his teammate.
Votel went to the intermediate stop first and let Hamilton fit in with the competition's tail, a likely decisive decision.
The Mercedes team set off for an interim stop later and returned to the race behind the Votel, but Hamilton moved forward after a tight wheel wrestling that eventually forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inner track to hold on to the risk of a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back of the ranking and was seventh at the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race and did not change tires to get a quick finish and bypass Kimmy Raikkonen to fourth place.
He eventually went down to an intermediate stop in the 44th round and was unable to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds when Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Voltaire did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me bypass him.
“The team has done an extraordinary job to get to the double,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a conference on Saturday, insisting she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “evil and vile and liars.”
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry, bad, vile and lying people,” he said.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>When you look at advertisements and leaks and then they say, “Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document? <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received from Ford a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, which was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied the leak had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s charges, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep his secret, and I kept the letter as secret as she asked me.”
But it doesn’t seem like the president’s denial was accepted, which he responded to during the conference on Saturday night: “I’m telling you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe it's not [the leak], but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed that Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
They are determined to return to power at all costs.
You see the convictions, the contemptuous, they don't care who they're hurting, who they're squeezing on the way to power and power," the president said in a report.
Elite League: Dundee stars 5-3 against Belfast giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee stars compensated for their loss in the elite league on the day and against the Belfast giants and won the next 5–3 game on Dundee on Saturday.
The giants had an early advantage from two expatriates who scored Patrick Dwyer and Francis at Wheeler.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney returned their team to business until Dwyer restored the advantage to the giants.
François Bouchard matched for the Danes until two expatriates of Lucas to Nilsen secured the victory.
This is the third loss of a season in an elite league for Adam Kief's team, who came back to defeat the 2-1 Danes in Belfast on Friday.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the giants have won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McPaul's cooking, and David Ruth Ford cooked the Bowlier's goal by doubling the score four minutes later.
In the first full-fledged trimester, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 until Matt Marquardt cooked Coney's equilibrium goal at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the giants' first break when he scored his second goal in the evening, at the end of the first trimester.
The home team was re-arranged and the rest scored again a goal that matched the force game at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined forces to help Nielsen give the Dundee an edge for the first time in the game, at the end of the second trimester, and Nielsen secured the Dundee win with the fifth goal, scoring half of the pitch in the last trimester.
The giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will compete in their home stadium against Milton Keynes on the next day.
Aviation inspector gave his life to ensure hundreds of passengers could escape an earthquake
An Indonesian aviation inspector has been crowned a hero after sacrificing his life to ensure an airplane with hundreds of passengers takes off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Day 6 and caused a tsunami.
Strong subshocks continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But although many of his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Ganawan Agung refused to abandon his position at a swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis al-Joffrey airport in Palo.
He stayed in place to ensure that BATEC Air Flight 6321 could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Sirite said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from the Alicante airport in Clementine to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palo.
“Our hearts are broken to hear the good news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands because, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency, access to Donagala, Siggi and Butong is limited.
“The death toll will continue to rise because many bodies are still buried under the rubble and access to many others is not possible,” said the agency’s spokesman, Satopo Porvo.
Waves of up to six meters in height destroyed Palu, and the city will have a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and equipment.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances bring bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-market shops are looted everywhere.”
Jan Galpand, the head of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working quickly to help the survivors but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
It’s a tragedy now, but it can get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s soldiers: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related missions.
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air New Guinea says one person is missing after plane crash in Laguna
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing after it said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that starting on Saturday afternoon, it was unable to say what had happened to one passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try and find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chok Island Airport.
Officials said on the same day that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that the situation of all remaining passengers was stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The U.S. Navy and Airline said the plane landed in Laguna just a short distance from the route.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane missed the route.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very low orbit.
“It’s a very positive thing,” Jayne said.
Janes said he and the others were able to pave their way to emergency water ports at the waist-altitude of the sinking plane.
He said the crew was panicking and screaming, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to improve a dock also helped rescue operations, using an inflatable boat that brought people to shore before the plane sank in water at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network (ASN), 111 people have been killed in the crashes of registered airlines in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but Air New Guinea has not been involved in any of these incidents.
Analyst describes the events of the night a woman was burned alive
The lawsuit proved its case on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to bring together the defendant’s movements, 29-year-old Quinton Tallis, and the movements of the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she was murdered.
According to the Clarion Ledger report, Rowlett said he received the location data from a number of mobile phones showing that Tallis was with Chambers the night she died, concealing his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with that of Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford got on the stand and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tallis was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tallis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers’ death, Tallis deleted Chambers’ text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday, as planned.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre and fills its music with positive messages.
The Bristol High Breed trio claims that hip-hop has distanced itself from its sources as a tool for expressing political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like the Foggies and the Commune have recently been resurrected in the UK through artists like Akala and Lauki.
Another black man?
New York therapist sues a couple for firing after "racist" text message
A New York therapist sues a couple for being fired on the grounds of discrimination after receiving a text message that was not intended for her from the mother who complained that the therapist was “another black person.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Miss Morris, twice.
After noticing the emission, Plasco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the former nanny, of African-American descent, had done a bad job, and that she now expected to hire a Filipino in her place.
Ms. Morris was paid for one working day and was sent home with Uber.
Now, Morris sues the couple for firing and seeks <0x24>350 a day for six months of work and living in a place for which they were originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, look, they don’t do things like that,” she told the post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple fought back over the claims of being racist, saying the end of Morris’ employment would have been requested, fearing that she would not be trusted after being hurt.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But did you put your child in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was an accident?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion" and said his wife was only supposed to have given birth two months before the incident and was "in a very difficult situation".
Do you want to go after someone like her?
It's not nice to do something like that," the investment banker added.
The legal case is still in progress, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, killing their behavior and the arguments they used.
A new letter reveals Paddington’s publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington’s tremendous success.”
After saying that her father, who worked for the BBC as a photographer before being inspired to write the children's book from a little toy bear, would become bloody thirsty about the rejection of his work, she added that on the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "Sweet-bitter" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Paddington’s success, which she described as “a very important member of our family.”
“He was a quiet man, not a proud man,” she said.
“But because Peddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who got something: you are proud of him even though it’s not really your fault.
I think he saw Paddington's success kind of like this.
Although it was his work and imagination, he always said it was due to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called on a regular basis and said she was in very bad shape, which is unlikely to last,” said Mrs. Adnan-Laparos.
“Then I got a call from Ned saying she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly disappeared and got out of her system.
She died sometime before and it's over, it's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people right now.
I really had to hold on.”
Ultimately, Ms. Ednan-Laparos, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who were unaware of the agony journey.
“No one knew,” she said.
My head was soft, and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a stunning sense of identification with Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women mourn postcards on bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hanged postcards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Mrs. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any other parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Laydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone recognized him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated every room.
But he stopped working before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, “I am constantly afraid of a chain reaction.”
“Mrs. Davis created the postcards, so people would know there was someone to turn to and talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don’t sit still – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davis’s for years, lost Mark, a life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the lowest level on Christmas Day – when the kids opened the presents, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but that they had overcome it: <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>It creates a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
We all have to fight and fight.”

Burt Kavanaugh’s future is at stake as the FBI begins his investigation.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>I thought, if we could really get what he asked — a time-limited and limited investigation — maybe we could bring about a bit of a reunification,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>breaking apart“ in the deep-rooted party stalemate.
Why were Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not interested in the FBI investigation?
Their deterrence stems entirely from timing.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans fail, they will be very weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to persuade them to support Quanu, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the equilibrium and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea drops under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-Sig, citing data from the South Korean union ministry, said the number of desertions last year was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and a rise in amounts charged by people smugglers.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters eventually obtain South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and which is easier to cross than the well-preserved military zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats displaced people as illegal immigrants and not refugees and often returns them forcibly.
North-South relations — which are technically still at war — have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which the two generally agreed to work towards an era where the Korean Peninsula would not have nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm our weapons first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate "hysterical" and said his character did not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi responded in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever appeared like this, they would have said ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he almost yelled and choked when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly denounced Democrats on the committee and called for arguments against him “a coordinated and grotesque character homicide” organised due to the anger of liberals over Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he’s stabbed himself with these statements and the way he’s been chasing the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to oust Kavanaugh if his appointment was approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
“He’s saying it that way — if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not fit, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court where he’s currently serving,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she has concerns about Cavanaugh’s possible rulings against Obama’s health reform or Rue v Wade’s ruling, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his approval hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions about the possibility of overturning certain Supreme Court decisions.
“There is no reason for a hysterical and bribing person to come to court and expect to be told, ‘Isn’t that great?’” Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It’s a sharp criticism, months and years of rage surpassing it, and it can’t express them without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s uncommon, do I?”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was running elsewhere, who said that she too was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique and every time she got angry and started crying, she used to tell the person she was talking to, “You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are accepted as a source of rage, in part because they are incomprehensible in essence.
One of my most significant memories of an early career in my life, in an office with a majority of men, is that I once found myself crying in an unspeakable rage, and an older woman caught my back, it was a cool manager that I was always a little scared of – and it dragged me into the stairs.
“Don’t let them see you never cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've managed to depress you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Colorado congresswoman, worked with Gary Hart during the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and exiting the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason for her not to consider running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a decision I thought about,” she told me 30 years later and laughed.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she joined the campaign late, she was late in raising funds, so she swore she would not join the race unless she raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who donated <0x24>1,000 to men, gave her just <0x24>250.
"They think I'm getting a discount?" She wondered.
During the speech she announced that she would not embark on a formal election campaign, her feelings flooded her so much — gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration from the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and focus on voters instead of representatives, and anger over sexual discrimination — she was choked by tears.
“You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
“You could think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my gravestone?

How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the opening shot earlier this year when he imposed a tax on important export products from China, including solar, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting <0x24>200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 million), effectively taxing half of goods imported to the United States from China.
Beijing has reacted every time in the same currency, and has recently raised tariffs by five to ten percent on US <0x24>60 billion worth of goods.
China has pledged to reverse any U.S. strike, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will yield in the near future.
A request from Washington to return would mean surrendering to its demands, but a public bow to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages to run right, the pressures from the U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the onset of economic turmoil in each of the countries is actually much more dangerous than what India has seen in the past,” said Abigail Grace, a research partner focused on Asia, at the New American Security think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for aid to rebuild the country that has been destroyed in a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muhammad said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the war on terror,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore the situation.
All conditions now exist for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures aimed at harming their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moallem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that financed the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the U.S. team in a 16.5–10.5 final on the La Golf Nationale off Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mikaelson, who fought for almost all of the tournament, sent his hit from the T-string to the water in the 16th hole of Parr-3, losing the game against Francesco Molinari.
The brilliant Italian golfer Molinari has become one of four players who have reached 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in the current structure, in 1979.
U.S. actor Jordan Spit was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranking European team player, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's first-ranked player, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Polter, which may be the last time he will play in the Ryder Cup.
With a record eight appearances at the Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European player with the highest number of tournaments victories with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a tough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the trophy back.
It's a team, and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He delivers the torch to his native John Ram who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the singles game on Sunday.
“The tremendous pride I feel, to defeat Tiger Woods, which I watched as I grew up,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and his record is now 13-21-3, culminating in the Ryder Cup in his career.
This is a strange statistic from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, with Jack Niklaus ahead of him alone.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find its way through the lawns, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pineau who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furrick spoke after the disappointing performance of his team, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment in the morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Well done to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We've been defeated."
