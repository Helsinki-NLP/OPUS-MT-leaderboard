Rapidly Increased Cumulative Number of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK, which confirms that although the phase varies depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown pathogens were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent, the novel coronavirus, is now referred to as the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that nearly 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illness; that is, they have respiratory infections with or without symptoms, and most of them recover.
In approximately 14%, COVID-19 has worsened to a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% suffer from a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients who have been hospitalized for COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and UK (UK) and compare them with those from Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After what happened in China, COVID-19 has increasingly spread geographically and is tracking the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world today.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 an epidemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of March 5, 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed European COVID-19 cases according to the WHO definition of the case.
In the European Union/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 for people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and 1 December 2019, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Cumulative number and Cumulative GPA of COVID-19 cases
At the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization, is updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess and compare COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK with those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative number of intermittent cases of COVID-19 within 14 days, and then took into account the normal course of COVID-19, in all EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of reported cases from each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m., comparing it to the number in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases during the 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom followed those of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative number of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February, then increased sharply on 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was often driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increase trends to the cumulative number of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK reported the total number of cases already similar to that found in Italy just 3 weeks or less.
Our findings indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is aggravating at a similar speed in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, and despite different national public health responses, the potential for different definitions of the situation in countries and the different protocols for the selection of patients to be tested for COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in Italy’s affected areas described the situation where nearly 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, media sources said hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization and/or intensive care units for COVID-19 cases are currently available at the EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data is not available).
However, they need to be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a great diversity in the availability of intensive and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds for intensive and intermediate care per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Satisfaction-related modelling scenarios, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalized cases <0x26>gt; 90% to exceed the capacity of intensive care beds, are available in the sixth update of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention’s Rapid Risk Assessment of COVID-19.
Since cases that have been compiled so far in certain regions of EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, hospitals and ICUs typically serve specific regional populations, information on cases and ICU beds is preferable at the NAME level of regional ICUs 2 (UTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the UK.
States, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare themselves for a sustainable SARS-CoV-2 community transition scenario and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care, such as this in the affected areas of Italy.
As outlined in the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention’s Rapid Risk Assessment, a proactive, comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with the shift from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a limited opportunity for countries to step up their regulatory efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, health care systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to experience an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere, causing a humanitarian disaster.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, similar to the SARS-CoV virus, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, can also transmit from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS but is more transmissible and influential among older people than young people and among men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will address the basics of the epidemiology of the disease, its causes, its virology, its diagnosis, treatment, predictions of the course of the disease, and prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help understand and eradicate the threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been urged to stay inside their homes for the duration of the holiday and for many weeks thereafter due to an outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (COV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-COV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the disease associated with CoV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and soon spread throughout the country, as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 patients dying.
The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that COVID-19 is “the No. 1 enemy of the public” and is likely to be stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 researches on COVID-19 have been published, including virology of the disease, its epidemiology, its causes, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report of many patients was issued on January 7, 2020.
This review aims to summarize research progress in the new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-induced disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prediction as well as some pressing questions that are still on the table.
Coronaviruses were commonly considered non-lethal pathogens in humans, and mainly caused about 15% of the four common colds.
However, in this century we have encountered two severely pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to many other countries with a terrifying prevalence and mortality rate.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of the coronavirus in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups with unidentified pneumonia were first reported by Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first death.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On January 20, infections were reported among health care providers, indicating that the disease could be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was shut down, with all public transport being shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that out of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, which considered the starting site of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation evolved rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak remained to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided a more up-to-date explanation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX<0x5F>rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all age groups, but mainly 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has expanded among groups in and around Hubei mainly.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of the infection to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time of infection from infancy to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The primary reproductive number (base reproductive number) was 3.77 (confidence range is 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the average base reproductive number was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the many travel processes ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (confidence range is 95%: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate per patient was 3.06% (confidence range is 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and acute pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a group of large, coated viruses that contain a single-chain positive DNA genome.
It can be divided into four species, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, and is known to infect humans with alpha and beta-sex coronaviruses.
The S-coated fork of diabetic protein binds to its cellular receptors, the converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dibutidylpeptidase 4 (DPB4) for SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV, respectively, and then the membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is cloned, the genome RNA is accompanied by glycemic envelope proteins and kernel proteins that contain ferions, and they merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus afterwards.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic identity exceeding 99.98% among 10 sequencing samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Bohan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than Mirs-CoV.
Electronic microscopy of transmission revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is present in extremely thin sections of human airway epithelium.
It has been revealed that the human enzyme converted to angiotensin 2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is linked to the human angiotensin-2-converting enzyme weaker than SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a short novel protein encrypted by orf3b and a secreted protein encrypted by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral morbidity and limit the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not contain any range or pattern with known function.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported the full-length structure of the human angiotensin 2 converted enzyme under a 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> ultra-cold electron microscope in a compound with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had accumulated to form a destroyer and that ACE2-B0AT1 could bind to the S protein, providing evidence to identify the coronavirus and infection.
Sodium-neutral amino acid carriers may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and intermediate host
It has been known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through yogurt and camel cats, respectively.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 strain development with other coronaviruses, bats were the original hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with the new virus 96 percent matching SARS-like bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the interfactorial barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the pathway of transmission has not yet been clarified.
J. et al. suggested snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involved a symmetrical recombination within S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that squamous ant-eaters – long-legged ant-eater mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine – are the potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic symmetry in the sarcoma-eater coronavirus.
However, the 1% variation spread across the genome is still a significant difference; hence, we expect conclusive results with concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and humidity ranging from 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to UV and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75% concentration, chlorine-containing disinfectants, acetic pyroxetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents are effective, but not chlorohydrate.
The entire human species generally lacks immunity against SARS-CoV-2, so they are more likely to become infected with the new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies related to other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Generally, after a host virus is invaded, the natural immune system recognizes it through pattern recognition receptors (PRRS), including type C receptors similar to ketane, TLR-like receptors, NLR-like receptors, and IRI-like receptors.
Through different pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammatory agents, the maturation of coagulation cells, and the synthesis of type I (IFN) interferons that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate large phagocytes of viral antigens.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response soon joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B>, play an important role in defense.
The CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate the B cells to produce antibodies dedicated to the virus, and the CD8<0x2B> T cells kill the virus-infected cells directly.
Assisted T cells produce inflammatory stimulant cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, the coronavirus can reduce the function of T-cells by inducing the programmed death of T-cells.
Mixed immunity, including complementary proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential in combating viral infections.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovering Mers-Cove patient neutralized.
On the other hand, an excessive immune system reaction generates a large number of locally free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, failure in multiple organ functions and death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which initially appeared in groups, is more likely to infect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is damaged are more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, or usually 3-7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period averaged 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed an incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, and thus prevent people who are infected but have no symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and primary symptom of COVID-19, and may not be accompanied by any other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nose splash, chest pain, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxia one week after the disease began.
In severe cases, the condition of patients evolved rapidly to suffer acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acids, and thrombopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be screened, even without imaging revealing lung abnormalities, for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group that was infected by someone who did not show symptoms.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that Merse-Cove patients also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as key symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed much more respiratory support than COVID-19 patients and were consistent with the higher MRI mortality rate of COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with Meyers.
In SARS patients, both fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), sore throat (13-25%) and respiratory support were found to be the most important symptom.
By February 14, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, while confirmed cases worldwide were 66,576.
By November 2002, the SARS mortality rate was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study found that SARS-CoV-2’s primary reproductive number was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence range from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV’s primary reproductive number ranged between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality rate, and primary reproductive number is shown in table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 has a greater proliferation capability than the MARS-CoV and SARS-CoV capability, but is less lethal than the latter.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more difficult to control than the Mirs-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The onset of the disease often occurs in the family itself, or from the assembly itself, or the vehicle itself, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travelling to or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contacting people or patients during the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks, and recovering patients who have been discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending an alarm to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphatic deficiency was detected with white blood cell counts <0x26>lt; 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L including lymphocyte counts <0x26>lt; 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, elevated levels of aspartate amine transporter and blood circulation in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Levels of liver, muscle and myoglobin enzymes in the blood of some patients increased, C-reactive protein increased, and the rate of red cholesterol heavierness in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe conditions, the level of Demer D, a result of fibrin breakdown in the blood, increased, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Imbalances in radiography appear in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double laparoscopic shades or opacity of laminated glass in the lungs.
Patients sometimes experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, out-of-control inflammation, fluid build-up, and progressive fibrosis severely affect the exchange of gases.
The dysfunction of the lung cells of type 1 and type 2 reduces the level of the surface activator and increases the surface tension, thus, reduces the ability of the lungs to stretch and increases the risk of lung breakdown.
Therefore, the worst thoracic scan results are often compared to the extreme severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, Covid-19’s first pathological analysis showed pulmonary cell abscess, hyalenic membrane formation, interstitial lymphatic leakage, and polynuclear cell cells in the lungs of a patient who died from disease, in line with the pathology of viral infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the BT-BCR serial polymerase reaction has been used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negative outcomes, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations of diagnosis (which is no longer individually based on RT-BCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiography discoveries is essential for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Chang Group described a protocol for the use of the CRISPR-based Sherlock technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, and it detects fragments of SARS-CoV-2-generated RNA at a rate of 20 x 10-18 mL to 200 x 10-18 mL/L min. using less than 10-100 <0xCE><0xBC>L.
We hope the new technology can significantly improve sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can provide supportive care mainly for COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of treatments that have been used or suggested before to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential antiviral treatments, immunodepressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma from recovering patients has been suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and antiviral vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first, and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that release the angiotensin-2-conversion enzyme, such as the digestive tract, intestines and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the most serious threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore necessary to alleviate symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-invasive respirators, and invasive artificial respirators based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with acute respiratory symptoms should be supported by extrabody membrane oxiga (ECMMO), a cardiopulmonary diagnostic technique used to treat cardiac failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, and protecting vital organ function, is also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine is known to be caused by an excessive immune system reaction in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reactions characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3> and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals and are the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for acute patients.
Anabolic hormones, tocilizumab, and a monoclonal anti-interleukine 6 antibody were used to treat a cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive therapies for the cyclone include T-cell directed immune reaction modification; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, TNF blockade; Janus kinase inhibition; plenatomomab; Capt for cytokine signals 4; and Histon decetilase inhibitors.
Steroids and immunosuppressants have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in larger doses were not beneficial with severe lung infection in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially anaphylactic bone necrosis, which severely affects the prediction of the course of the disease.
However, short cycles of anabolic hormones in small to medium doses have been recommended with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, the efficacy of any antiretroviral treatment has not been confirmed.
Nonetheless, intravenous administration of rimedesiver, a neocletide analogue, has been found to be effective with an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesiver is a novel antiviral developed by Giliad initially to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed potential inhibition of other viruses with single-chain RNA, including Mers and SARS.
Based on these viruses, Gilliad introduced the compound to China for some experiments on individuals with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are closely monitored.
In addition, paracetamol, interferon-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were suggested as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur after combination therapy with Lupinavir/Ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medications used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovering patients and antibody generation
Blood collection from patients who have recovered from a disease is intended to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from developing the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovering patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immune globules (AG) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize and neutralize the unique molecules in pathogens directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected in 10 patients with serious conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation, viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to bring this method to widespread use before specific treatments can be reached.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects need to be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is likely to be life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for treating patients with critical conditions.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies and produce them quickly enough to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, isolating B-cells from recovering patients and identifying gene codes that encode effective antibodies, or screening for effective antibodies against the core proteins of the virus, is more decisive and practical.
This way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend heavily on a variety of components in a combination that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or obscure as they are difficult to extract and verify these ingredients or their optimal formulations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the efficacy of Xu Fengjie Doo capsules and Lian Hua King Win capsules for COVID-19 treatment has been discovered.
The highest cure rates in treating COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China in 87% of its patients, including Ganzo (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used traditional Chinese medicine only with about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is an entirely approximate comparison, as many other factors of impact such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Polly Zhang and his co-workers published a study to compare Western Medicine (WM) treatment individually with Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine combined therapy.
They found that the durations needed to recover from hyperthermia, symptoms, and hospitalization were significantly shorter in the Western Medicine <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group compared to the Western Medicine only treatment group.
Most impressively, the rate of symptom aggravation (slight to severe) was significantly lower in the Western Medicine <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group compared to the Western Medicine only (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western Medicine <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group compared to the Western Medicine only (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine is still awaiting more well-studied trials on larger scales and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to describe the mechanism of the procedures and clarify the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their formulations if possible.
Patients suspected of or confirmed to have COVID-19 often feel severe fear of the highly infectious and even fatal disease, and people under quarantine are bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by anabolic hormones, can lead to more anxiety and mental disorder.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of mental illnesses were reported including permanent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delusion, and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact and quarantine tracking, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
Mental health care should therefore be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, contacts, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and plans to treat it, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact with each other.
Effective vaccines to cut off the transmission chain from infected animals and humans to hosts at risk are necessary and often complementary to antiviral therapy in the fight against emerging virus-caused epidemics.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective, long-term antibodies and/or preventive immunity against SARS-CoV.
Attenuated live vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for the treatment of SARS.
However, the efficacy of these in vivo candidate vaccines in older adults and fatal challenge models in preventing infection with animal-sourced viruses has not been determined prior to the start of a clinical study.
This is probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
By contrast, sporadic MERS cases and groups continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of livestock sources in the endemic areas.
Immunization strategies against MERS were developed using inactive viruses, RNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and sub-units of recombinant protein, some of which were evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is a challenge due to the length of time (average 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of coronaviruses.
COVID-19, as a novel disease, has just begun to show its full clinical course across thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without punishment.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high prevalence and mortality rates in severe patients.
Therefore, building a prognosis model is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-limited areas.
Based on clinical studies that have been reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in determining the prediction of the course of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
The age groups between 30 and 65 mainly developed COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to develop underlying diseases and complications and were much older than those who did not (at an average age of 66 versus 51), indicating age as a predictive factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Concomitant diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injuries and arrhythmia.
Heart accidents were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to also be linked to positive bile cells with angiotensin-2-converting enzyme, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that the underlying age and disease are strongly linked and may overlap with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and has been suggested to be a predictive factor for the disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
The association between the level of C-reactive protein and the severity of COVID-19 disease and its prognosis was also proposed.
In addition, the elevation of the enzyme extracting lactate hydrogen (LDH), aspartate amine carrier (AST), alanine amine transporting enzyme (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of functional dysfunctions in the heart or liver.
Key clinical symptoms: chest radiography and the progress of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other problems to predict the outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Usage of steroids: As described above, steroids are immune suppressants commonly used as an adjunctive treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high-dose anabolic hormones have been widely used in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered angioedema with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, low-dose and short-term steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced exceptional stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close family members and sick colleagues.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological traits than SARS.
In addition to reincarnation in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reincarnate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, causing difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission was considered to occur when patients were in severe condition, while most transmissions of the virus did not occur in the early stage.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Strong efforts are currently underway in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost all residents in the hopes of hindering the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have severely damaged the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the recession will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be far more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. created a model for predicting the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in midweeper and throat swabs for patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a flu-like periodic attack.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may have been working.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to 1 million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually controlled by strict quarantine and isolation measures.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can become weaker in terms of causing infection and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic is presented below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with material contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in stools, raising a new possibility of passing from stool to mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases could be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, significant precautions are needed to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passersby who have contacted sick or injured persons.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (serie 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent a potentially infected person from passing through the air or sticking to the surfaces of the material, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (the 1860s series) can protect against inhalation of small feriones of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of feriones able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 looks like SARS-CoV in size and are approximately 85 nm each.
Since particles can penetrate up to five combined surgical masks, health care providers directly in contact with patients should wear N95 masks (serie number 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate insulation clothing to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face protections or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with more disinfectant soap than usual, and try to stay at home for self-quarantine and reduce contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is an appropriate distance to keep people away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its strong resemblance to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 would have caused a high alert in China based on its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, the director of the Centers for Disease Control in Wuhan did not reassure citizens until January 19, 2020, saying that the new virus has a low infection rate and a limited human-to-human reproduction rate and that there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message severely reduced public alert, especially when the entire state was preparing for the Spring Festival, and wasted a critical time to contain the disease in its lowest range in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must be (1) more cautious when issuing public statements because each word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and interacting with unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain and improve a potential epidemic response system in its early stages, rather than attempting to reassure the public; (4) more.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
It spread in less than two months across China and some 50 other countries worldwide at the time of writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has triggered a sense of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than young people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rate is also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even while they are symptomatic, while SARS patients usually do this when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
A normal RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can become infected with the virus again.
These results significantly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With this rapid progress in research on COVID-19, many critical issues remain to be solved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, like bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the numbers 1 and 2, we cannot efficiently stop the transition, and the outbreak can come back at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to the angiotensin-2-converting enzyme, how exactly does the virus enter the cells of the airway and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with the cells of the detachment of the Angiotensin 2-converting enzyme in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a rapid and accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it fade like SARS, or will it come back periodically like the flu?
It is necessary but may take some time to look for answers to the above questions and many other questions.
However, at all costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normal.
Animal Origins of Human Coronaviruses
The mutation and adaptation have been driving the co-development of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, it was known that two types of human coronaviruses (human coronaviruses) caused a mild disease, such as a cold.
The outbreak of acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shown the other face to reveal how dangerous and life-threatening human coronavirus infections can be.
The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has re-evaluated the coronavirus and surprised us by its rapid spread but with the ability to cause the disease compared to its brother SARS-CoV.
The human coronavirus is an animal disease of origin, so our understanding of the animal origins of human coronaviruses will serve us well.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats where they were not pathogenic.
Intermediate warehouse hosts for some human coronaviruses have also been known.
Identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating the interactive relationships between the coronavirus and the host in animals also provides an important insight into the emergence of coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available about the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as their animal origins and interspecies transmission.
Most importantly, we compare and predict the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The disease caused by the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, it also highlights the host’s successful switching requirements and the impact of the complications of the virus’s development on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses (Coronaviruses) belong to the Coronavirus family, which comprises a group of laminated viruses with a single-chain positive RNA.
These viruses contain the largest genome of RNA viruses, with 26 to 32 kilograms of base, and are called "coronaviruses" by the same name because their structure is like a crown under an electronic microscope.
In terms of synthetic properties, coronaviruses contain indivisible genomics that share a similar regulation.
Nearly two-thirds of the genome has two large overlapping open reading templates (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted to polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Multiple proteins are additionally treated to generate 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remaining part of the genome contains open reading templates for structural proteins, including Spike (S), Cover (E), Membrane (M) and Nuclear Protein (N).
Different strains of coronaviruses also encode a number of additional proteins from special strains.
Based on the variability in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus, and delta-coronavirus), including beta-coronaviruses that include most human coronaviruses and are divided into four strains (A, B, C and C).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents act as genetic origin for most of the alpha and beta coronaviruses, while birds are the main repository of the gamma and delta coronaviruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently crossed species barriers and some have emerged as causes of serious human diseases.
So far, seven human coronaviruses (Human Coronaviruses) are known.
Among them, the HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belong to the alpha coronaviruses.
The other five beta coronaviruses include the human coronavirus-OC43, the human coronavirus-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Human Coronavirus-229E, Human Coronavirus-OC43, Human Coronavirus-HKU1 and Human Coronavirus-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds, diarrhoea or both.
By contrast, SARS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus are all highly pathogenic, causing severe infection of the lower respiratory tract to a greater number of patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASS) and non-respiratory symptoms.
HIV-229E, the first strain B814, was isolated from nasal secretions of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Much of the information has since been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, whose symptoms are automatically cured.
In fact, it was generally recognized that the human coronavirus infection was harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is among the deadliest in our history, with more than 8,000 people with nearly 10 percent deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) spread a steady epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with a sprawling spread to the rest of the world.
The novel human coronavirus 2019, renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell is ringing and the world is preparing for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses from bats, where the viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic but show significant genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social, and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the animal origins of human coronaviruses showed a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and limiting factors for interspecies mobility.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2’s warehouse, intermediate host, and amplified host (amplified host animals), with important effects to prevent future repercussions.
In this review we provide an overview of animal origins, interspecies transmission, and human coronaviruses cause disease.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the popular belief that the original viruses of human coronaviruses are usually non-pathogenic in their natural warehouse hosts but become pathogenic after they are transmitted between species to a new host.
We also review the assessment of the course of the HCoV where the increase in its transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in the severity of the disease.
We are also discussing in this context the consequences of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of the B814 strain of HCoV-229E from nasal secretions of cold-infected patients, various coronaviruses were isolated from various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decades, seven types of human coronavirus have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of the human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) will be educational and indicative.
The first strain of human coronavirus-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infection in 1966, and then adapted to live in WI-38 lung cells.
Patients with HIV-229E experience common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise, sore throat, fever, and cough in approximately 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the human coronavirus-OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and subsequent transmission was in the brains of infant mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be distinguished by symptoms from other respiratory viruses such as influenza A viruses and nasal viruses.
Both the HCO-229E and HCO43 have spread globally, and tend to be transmitted during the winter season in mild climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a feeling of illness for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, the infection of healthy individuals with the HCoV-229E has caused mild colds.
Only a few patients with immunodeficiency showed severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, is the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history and the third human coronavirus to be detected is SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong, China.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed infections and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the super-infection carrier, it has been estimated that a single infection can lead to approximately two secondary conditions, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load on the 10th day of the disease.
SARS-CoV symptoms begin with muscle pain, headache, fever, disability, and chills, followed by late symptoms of difficulty breathing, coughing and respiratory distress.
Lymphatic deficiency, liver dysfunction, and high creatine kinase are common laboratory imbalances of SARS.
In SARS patients, widespread synaptic damage, apparent cell proliferation, and increased phagocyte counts are also observed.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then need intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, in severe cases, many organs, including the digestive tract, liver, and kidneys, can also be infected and usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially in patients with immune deficiency.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the first case who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on the human coronavirus.
NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, older people, and immunodeficiency patients with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by the HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a sample of the nose of an 8-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Despite its discovery in the Netherlands, it is widespread globally.
It is estimated that the human coronavirus-NL63 is responsible for nearly 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, the peak occurring during early summer, spring and winter.
Human Coronavirus-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngeitis, also known as choking.
In the same year, HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma attacks.
HKU1 has been found to be globally prevalent, causing mild respiratory diseases, similar to HKN-NL63, HK-229E and HK-OC43.
All four of these human-acquired coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and in general the likelihood that they will mutate to cause diseases with low prevalence rates is low, but the coincidence has occurred for unknown reasons, as in the rare case of the most severe subtype of the human coronavirus-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe infection of the virus.
In general, when coronaviruses acquire this ability to transmit efficiently and continuously maintain themselves within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Myers-Cove was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, in many European countries and Tunisia cases have been reported from abroad and a rare secondary transmission of contacts in close personal contact.
Another secondary outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
Myers' clinical symptoms are similar to those caused by SARS, and are characterized by worsening acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many people with MERS also suffered severe kidney failure, which MERS distinguishes from other diseases caused by the human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases with a high mortality rate of 34.4% were reported, making Merse-Cove one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid-December to late 2019, groups of pneumonia patients later known to be the result of SARS-CoV-2 infection were discovered in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current outbreak of lower respiratory infection due to the SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international significance and has called it COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with an initial mortality rate of 3.4%.
The mortality rate in China’s Hubei province is 4.2%, while abroad is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV, and appears in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea also appears in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homogeneity of the sequence of nucleotides at 82%, they belong to different branches in the tree of strain evolution.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less severe but more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It has been reported that people who are symptomatic despite being infected with SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses revealed significant similarities and differences.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in the incubation period and the time period of the disease.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 infection falls between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 has features that are more common in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including the appearance of unspecified or minor symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the transmissionability of human coronaviruses acquired by society.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human transmission, as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether the SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the oral anal route plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least in some cases.
It is worth considering whether SARS-CoV-2 may show a seasonal prevalence as in cases of human coronaviruses acquired from society.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including the possibility of transition, and the mechanism of disease and sustainable post-transition proliferation for humans, will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four human coronaviruses acquired from the community and causing minor symptoms have adapted well to humans.
Another perspective, which may also be true, is that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, they may both be survivors of the old coronavirus epidemic.
Human coronaviruses, which infect humans with acute diseases, as well as people who have been infected with acute human coronavirus diseases, have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses in humans must be copied enough to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations facing host-restricting factors.
From this logic, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more infected, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, it is difficult to stop its transmission between humans through quarantine or other anti-infection measures.
The four community-acquired coronaviruses spread among human populations over many years, causing a cold in people with good immunity.
These viruses do not need an animal warehouse.
By contrast, the highly pathogenic Sars-Cove and Mers-Cove did not adapt well to humans, and were unable to continue the transition between humans.
They need to stay in their animal depots and breed in them and then look for the right opportunity to move on to the most vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplified hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to SARS-CoV/Mers-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired by society.
It is highly contagious like the human coronaviruses acquired by society, at least for now.
However, it causes more infection than human coronaviruses acquired from the community and less than SARS-CoV or Mers-CoV.
It is not yet clear whether it will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a warehouse or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it would be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, warehouse, intermediate, and amplified hosts of human coronaviruses.
The animal plays the role of the evolutionary host of the human coronavirus if it hosts the virus of close-related origin and shares a significant similarity in the level of nucleotide sequences.
The virus of origin is usually well adapted and not pathogenic to this host.
Similarly, the host host hosts the HCoV on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, the hosts are normally infected and are the normal hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent.
By contrast, if the HCoV enters the new intermediate host prior to or near attacking humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes illness.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and also plays the role of an amplified host by allowing the virus to temporarily copy and thus transmit to humans to expand the range of infection among humans.
The HCoV infection may reach a dead end if the virus fails to transmit from within the intermediate host.
Conversely, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host so that they can settle it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural warehouse host.
Later epidemiological data revealed that the first case of SARS had a history of contact with the hunter.
Subsequent seroprevalence surveys indicated that animal dealers had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to ordinary people.
The masked palm butter (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in live animal sales markets were first identified with SARS-CoV-like viruses almost identical to SARS-CoV.
What indirectly supported this was the fact that no other SARS case was reported after all butter cats were killed in the markets.
However, the SARS-CoV test result in masked palm butter that lives in the wild or on farms without exposure to live animal markets has been reported to be largely negative, indicating that masked palm butter may be only a medium amplifier host, but not the natural repository of SARS-CoV.
As 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, the likelihood that multiple species of small mammals also serve as SARS-CoV's amplifier host is not excluded.
It seems that all these are hosts who don't transfer SARS-CoV.
Subsequent research into the natural animal host of SARS-CoV led to the detection of the closely related bat coronavirus, called the HKU3 Red Horse Flea virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (HKU3).
The test result of SARS-CoV antibodies in these bats and the sequence of the red Chinese horse bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 was positive.
This virus and other bat coronaviruses share a 88-92% symmetry of nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several AVS-like coronaviruses (AVS-like coronaviruses) have been identified by bats, but none can be isolated as a living virus except for WIV1.
The human angiotensin 2 converted enzyme (an angiotensin 2 converted enzyme) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from a feces sample for bats was shown to be using the angiotensin 2-converting enzyme in bats, butter cats, and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, the serum of those recovering from acute acute respiratory syndrome had the ability to equate WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most SARS-CoV-related virus in bats, as they share a 95% symmetry of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high symmetry between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the host of a direct SARS-CoV repository.
Analysis of the evolution of the MERS-CoV strains in the coronavirus-HKU4 group in bats and the coronavirus-HKU5 in bats themselves.
Coronavirus-HKU4 is used in bats and Mers-Cove itself host receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase4 (dipeptidyl-peptidase4), to enter the virus.
The MRI-CoV RNA-based polymerase sequences are closer in terms of the evolution of strains to its beta-coronavirus counterparts in bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Mers-Cove lives in wild bats.
In his closest bats, Mers-CoV and HKU25 share a 87% symmetry of nucleotide sequences.
Thus, bats may not be the direct warehouse for Mers-Cove.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the only serum-positive dandruff camels for the Meyers-Cove equation of antibodies, as well as dandruff camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Mers-Cove's living, identical to the virus found in humans, has been isolated from the nasal wipes of the single-skinned camels, indicating that camels serve as the host of Mers-Cove's original warehouse.
It is also worth noting that minor symptoms generally appeared in camels that had been experimentally infected with Meyers-Cove, but a dense viral spread was observed.
Infected camels were noticeably spreading viruses not only through breathing but also through the oral anal tract, which is the primary way to spread the virus from bats.
However, there are still questions because many confirmed MERS cases do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, and these cases have been attributed logically to human-to-human transmission or unknown pathways of transmission involving unknown species of animals that harbour MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 RaTG13 virus is involved in bats isolated from horse fox bats in a 96.2% nucleotide symmetry.
The sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship with the father, as in the case of SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV.
This means that bats may not be the direct host(s) of the SARS-CoV-2 warehouse unless bat coronaviruses are found almost identical in the future.
SARS-CoV-2's intermediate hosts are supposed to be among the wildlife species sold and killed at Wuhan Seafood Market, which has been associated with several initial cases of COVID-19, suggesting a potential animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered young mammals known as manis javanica could also harbor beta-original coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The genomics of this ants-eating novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share a 85-92% symmetry of nucleotide sequences.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% similarity in nucleotide sequences.
Two subspecies of SARS-like viruses, similar to SARS-CoV-2, are grouped in a strain evolution tree, one of which shares a similar sphere of receptor bonding with SARS-CoV-2, matching amino acid sequences of 97.4%.
In stark contrast, the fields of receptor correlation for SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are significantly different, although the symmetry of the entire genome sequence is higher.
A previous study of a patient squamous ant eater also revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, which were similarly linked to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of synthesis and manual processing to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of a full-length viral genome of approximately 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the squamous ant eater is one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that squamous ant-eaters are the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the variance of serums between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2 in squamous ant-eaters.
In addition, the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2 in squamous ant-eaters.
The evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, squamous ants, and other mammals is still under recruitment.
While the highest serial symmetry has been found in the fields of receptor correlation between SARS-CoV-2 and squamous ant eaters, the beta coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the higher symmetry of the complete genome sequence.
It is predominantly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the fields of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding in the squamous ant-eaters of the coronavirus beta and SARS-CoV-2 are driven by selective convergence development.
There is a likely anti-synthesis proposal between SARS-CoV-2 in the beta-coronavirus squamous ant-eater and RaTG13 in third wild animal species.
Reconstruction is widespread among beta-coronaviruses as a driving force of evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to the highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the animal origins of the human coronavirus-229E, the human coronavirus-OC43, the human coronavirus-NL63 and the human coronavirus-HKU1 have also been studied.
Evidence of strain development suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while parent HCO-OC43 and HKU1 viruses have been found in rodents.
The coronavirus in bats called ARCoV.2 (Aplash Heights Coronavirus) detected in North American tricolor bats has been reported to have a close relationship with the human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E has been found to be genetically linked to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and it has been suspected that the pelvis is also its intermediate host.
For clarification, current information on the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Analysis of the evolution of strains provided evidence of human coronavirus transmissions between species throughout history.
When the human coronavirus-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domesticated livestock around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of human coronavirus-229E transmission between species is still less pronounced.
Alpha coronaviruses in bats have been found to be closely related to the HCo229E virus.
There is an alpha-coronavirus in the alpaca.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans and not alpaca may have contact with bats in a common ecological habitat.
Humans have close contact with alpaca.
Second, the human coronavirus-229E of the alpha-coronavirus in bats is multiple and non-pathogenic, while the alpha-coronavirus in alpaca causes respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca-related coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpaca was infected with the human-alpha-229E coronavirus cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause diseases to humans including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hindra virus.
So it’s not surprising that bats may transmit the human coronavirus-229E directly to humans.
While alpha-coronaviruses in bats act as the synthesis of HCoV-229E genes, alpaca and single swamp camels may act as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in Mers-Cove.
Meyers-Cove gives an excellent example of transmutation between species: it passes from bats to single-skinned camels and from single-skinned camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of Meyers-Cove from bats has been known since its inception and has also been reinforced by subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus species to exchange genes within one species and transmit between species.
Bats are characterized by longevity, living in overcrowded colonies, close social interaction, and strong ability to fly, all of which are favorable conditions to make them an ideal "virus distributor".
On the other hand, Mers-Cove has moved to the only camels that slept for decades.
These camels may have adapted well until they switched from an intermediate host to a natural and stable warehouse host.
Myers-Cove causes very minor disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
His intermittent transmission to humans remains a coincidence, and man is a non-transmitting host for Mers-Cove where his transmission cannot continue.
Contrary to the role of camels in the transfer of Mers-Cove, the role of shrimp-eaters, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, beta-coronaviruses associated with squamous ant-eaters infect him with severe illness.
They may be non-transmitter hosts for SARS-CoV-2 of beta-coronaviruses, similar to the buttercat in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies will determine the many possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species of animals to humans by either proving or excluding them.
First, bats may be the host of a virus-linked SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is mostly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans and bats may share the ecological habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, squamous ant-eaters could be one of the intermediate hypertrophic hosts of the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and consuming hunting meat.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely to be at risk for SARS-CoV-2.
There is a justification for scanning antibodies in pets and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, there may have been a repositioning and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in a third type that has contact with bats and squamous ants.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origin is still ongoing.
Aside from the different types of animal hosts, from the viral side there are three main and also important factors in facilitating coronavirus infection to cross species barriers.
First of all, her mutation rates are relatively high in RNA multiplication.
Estimated Coronavirus mutations rates, compared to other single-series RNA viruses, can be considered “medium” or “high” with an average switch rate of <0x7E>10-4 switches per year to site 2, depending on the stage of the Coronavirus’s adaptation to the new flight attendants.
Coronaviruses include the externally corrective ribonuclease enzyme, which results in a very high mutability and attenuation or inability to develop.
Interestingly, Rimedesivir is known for its ability to suppress the transmutation of the coronavirus by inhibiting the external ribonuclease enzyme and RNA-based RNA-based polymerase.
Rimedesiver is one of the promising agents against SARS-CoV-2 and is scheduled to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of coronavirus mutations are about a million times higher than the rates of hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt appropriately to the host.
The mutation rate for SARS-CoV-2 is markedly low when compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It seems that he has already adapted to another host close to man.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the Mers-CoV, which has adapted well to single-skinned camels.
In theory, genetic deviation from vaccines and antiviral drugs is unlikely to help resist SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the massive RNA genome in coronaviruses actively provides additional plasticity in genome editing for mutations and recombination, increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions become appropriate.
This is supported by unique, abundant open reading templates and encrypted protein functions near the end of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly switch molds during RNA copying through a unique “copy-choice” mechanism.
In a host that is like a blending pot, sequence switching occurs frequently during the RNA copying of the coronavirus.
Highly symmetrical, high-length, secondary genomic nucleic acids may recombine to generate new coronaviruses.
Evidence of the evolution of strains for natural recombination has been found in HKU1 and HKO43, as well as animal coronaviruses such as HKU9 in bats and HKU9 in bats.
Transmission-related interaction of the virus with the host
In addition to the three aforementioned viral factors, a viral interaction with the host receptor is another major factor affecting the transmission between species.
In this regard, we take SARS-CoV repositioning as a typical example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies transition incidents.
Based on comparative analysis of isolated samples of SARS-CoV in humans and butter cats, SARS-CoV was thought to be undergoing rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly through mutations in the S-protein receptor binding field.
In general, the S-CoV receptor binding domain interacts with the cellular receptor and is extensively selected by the antibody's response to the host.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding field in amino acids occurs from 318 to 510 in segment S1, which is linked to the enzyme converted to angiotensin 2 as well as the auxiliary receptors to enter the virus.
The field of receptor binding in SARS-CoV is able to identify assisted receptors of angiotensin-2-converting enzyme in different animals, including bats, butter cats, mouse and raccoons, allowing the virus to be transmitted between species.
In fact, only 6 residues of amino acids that differed from human and butter-isolated viral specimens in the receptor binding field were observed, 4 of which were found in the receptor sequencing pattern for interaction with the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme receptor.
The mutations K479N and S487T are found in the SARS-CoV receptor binding field in the yolk cat, which can increase the likelihood of Spike protein interaction in the human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme receptor.
In other words, these two types of amino acid alternatives may be critical to viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor found in SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the protein, which implicitly suggests that the likelihood of an S in the human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme binding has changed.
Indeed, a study in the ultra-cold electron microscope has indicated a 10 to 20-fold higher likelihood of this correlation compared to what happens between the human angiotensin 2 transformer enzyme and the SVS-CoV protein.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of assisted receptor may be necessary for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, the human coronavirus-NL63 is also associated with the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme but in a different part of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as the NN protein analyzer for HCO-229E, and 9-O for HCO-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after the transition between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of cross-species transmission of human coronaviruses is also controlled by other factors of dependency and host constraints.
The ramification of these host proteins between humans and hosts of the natural reservoirs of coronaviruses, such as bats, single camels, and rodents may be an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses need to control host dependency factors and weaken constraint factors for successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of the virus's interaction with the host remain detectable and characteristical.
A broad, unbiased genome scan can be used to investigate the dependency and host constraints of SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology.
Emerging Human Coronaviruses: Back to the Start Point
The diversity of coronaviruses in bats presents ample opportunities for the emergence of novel human coronaviruses.
From this logic, bat coronaviruses are a genetic compound for human coronaviruses.
In addition, the rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of the human coronavirus, which are two important points in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encryption genes involves the ability to significantly modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV regulatory proteins, ORF8 was thought to be important in adapting to humans, as SARS-CoV was isolated in bats but was found to encode different ORF8 proteins.
The 29 nucleotide deletion characteristics of SARS-CoV were found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion has divided ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that enhances host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination through the alpha and gamma coronavirus strains, with a large number of small recombination areas identified in RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Nsp9 reinstallation sites, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14 have also been identified.
In a similar way, research has shown that the Myers-Cove epidemic has seen cases of recombination between different strains, which have occurred in the only dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reintegrations have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses have been combined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which are likely to result from viruses getting rid of selective pressures, such as what happens with the host’s immune system.
ORF4 loss of full-length protein in the HCoV-229E phenotype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although proper ORF4 can be observed in camel and bat viruses associated with HCo229E, the alpha-infecting alpha coronavirus shows a single nucleotide stitch, resulting in a stitching frame mutation.
Last but not least, the development of new coronaviruses is also driven by selective pressure in their warehouse hosts.
Unsymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have been detected only when bats are infected with coronaviruses, indicating the mutual adaptation of coronaviruses and bats.
It has been shown that bats adapted appropriately to anatomically and physiologically coronaviruses.
For example, weak activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduced the pathogens triggered by coronaviruses.
In addition, normal killer cellular activity in bats was suppressed by an increase in the NKG2/CD94 inhibitor cellular receptor rate and a lower level of expression of the particles of the main class I histological compatibility compound.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen compounds (reactive oxygen compounds) resulting from the high metabolic activity of bats can lead to both suppressing the copying of the coronavirus and influencing the correction by the external ribonuclease enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the emergence of new pathogenic strains.
Additional pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may arise by recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Accordingly, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in warehouse hosts such as bats and camels.
They reproduce strongly without arousing a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why undesirable virus carriers see acute conditions in human infection.
Acute symptoms are mainly caused by hyperactivity of the immune response and a cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of non-symptomatic carriers, the immune response separates from the copying of the coronavirus.
A similar strategy for detachment of the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, Interferon type I can be used at least in the first stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory particle activation in bats is weak.
With this mental logic, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammatory particle using the MCC950 inhibitor is beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea of SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV.
At the time it was discovered that the beta-coronavirus in bats shared 95% of the nucleotide homogeneity of SARS-CoV, there was also a bat coronavirus that shared 96% of the nucleotide homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2.
While it has been discovered that butter cats and other animals on the market are harbouring viruses similar to SARS-CoV, they have not detected the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate live hosts.
Beta-coronaviruses have been detected in shrimp ant-eaters, which are highly homogeneous with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that shrimp-eaters may be intermediate hosts or that shrimp-eaters-beta-coronaviruses have contributed to gene-cutting, which led to the final release.
Although questions are still on the table, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either by accident or not.
Coronaviruses have returned to the focus of attention due to the onset of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically altered our idea of the importance of the origins of animal diseases and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 all originated from the bat and passed on to humans through intermediate flight attendants.
Based on the SARS-CoV infection stemming from contact between humans and butterfly cats in the markets, the closure of fresh products markets and the killing of butterfly cats were supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
With the same mental logic, squash ant-eaters should be disposed of from the fresh product markets to prevent transmission of animal origins, in light of the discovery of multiple lineages of beta-coronaviruses in squamous ant-eaters that are very close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans, as well as no matter how it is transmitted, through squamous ant-eaters and other mammals, its transmission remains a subject that needs to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, Mers-Cove was found in the only camels that slept for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and are a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for locals.
It is widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control Mers, as did officials in China’s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of Meyers, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective Meyers-Cove vaccines for camels, as well as other anti-infection measures.
Because we cannot completely eliminate these viruses, new genetic patterns may arise and cause outbreaks.
A variety of coronaviruses associated with animal diseases of origin exist in wildlife.
In particular, coronaviruses are highly diverse in bats that have the potential to cause animal diseases.
There are many opportunities for the development and recombination of coronaviruses associated with animal diseases, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible and/or lethal in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some places in China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the midst of the adversities of mankind caused by SARS, Mers and COVID-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The fact suggests that many viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural warehouses until they have a chance to spread and multiply.
Although bats have many characteristics that are likely to spread, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that obliges them to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which proves useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and preventing future emergencies.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent viral diseases of animal origin is to move people away from the ecological locations of natural reservoirs of animal disease-causing viruses.
The mystery of the zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2 disease is still surrounded by many questions that need to be answered.
First, if bats transmit the virus of SARS-CoV-2 origin to squash ant-eaters, it is important to know what conditions they have prepared to share bats and squat-eaters in a similar environmental setting.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of the disease to humans, then the manner in which humans communicate with them should be determined.
Third, if a third species of mammals plays the role of a true intermediate host, then it should be explained how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and squamous ants.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both observation and experimental infection should be performed.
Whether the host is a bat, shrimp ant-eater or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses are expected to be identified and are nearly identical in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important measures to prevent and control COVID-19 in humans.
Need to update the “suspect case” and “confirmed case” criteria when diagnosed with COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Quick Guideline on Diagnosing and Treating the 2019 New Coronavirus (NECO-2019) infection, which provided our experience and included relevant reference information to fight the pandemic globally.
Although coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increases based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a commentary on our guidance and presented the newest diagnostic criteria – “suspicious case” and “confirmed case” – in accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (version 7) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (novel coronavirus-2019) outbreak, which is now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and has been called the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as an epidemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team drafted a quick guidance and published it online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He has received a lot of attention since his publication.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increases based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (/http://www.nhc.gov.cn), between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven versions were issued in total, with some contexts fundamentally changing.
Our guidance has now responded to a comment from Zhou and others, who have made a simple score monitoring proposal based on a clinical trial.
Their efforts have added a new guide to our guidance and have become a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support their great efforts and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (trial version 7) and recent studies.
According to version 7 (3 March 2020), the confirmation of the suspected case needs to combine any of the characteristics of an epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to reach a comprehensive analysis, or three elements of clinical manifestations need to be verified in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history that includes travel to Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities that have reported cases of COVID-19, or stay there, during the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history that includes contact with SARS-CoV-2 infections, or a history that includes a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infections; or a history that includes a history of contact with patients with fever or disease.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with characteristics that are demonstrated by scanning for COVID-19 infection; (3) showing the total number of white blood cells normally, or slightly, or lower than the number of lymphocytes in the early stage of onset of infection.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case involving any of the elements of evidence of pathogens or serum reactions as follows: (i) positive BCR real-time test result for SARS-CoV-2; (ii) high homogeneity of the entire viral genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2; (iii) positive antibody test results of the antigen-I-Type virus; (G-II-II- or I-type-type-type-II-II-O-2-O-2-O-O-2-O-O-O-2-O-2-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-2-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-2-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-2-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-2-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-2-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-2-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
We see that the real-time DNA DNA serial reaction test in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
The detection of pathogens in the blood sample was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then the directory of serum interactions was added to the seventh.
These modifications have relied on researchers’ ongoing work to design an ideal DNA detection toolkit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood samples, which have increased the availability of different samples and supported the transfer of positive antibody outcomes to confirmed case standards.
In addition, there is growing evidence that calls for caution when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and non-symptomatic conditions.
Therefore, the content of the information flow chart should be updated for Zhou et al., as they rated the clinically symptom-free person at a “low risk” degree.
The score monitoring system also needs to be verified in practice and additional clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope to get more direct evidence and invite our readers to provide us with their comments.
To diagnose the “suspect case” and the “confirmed case”, we call for the following and adherence to the latest guidance from the home countries.
Our team will also update our guidance in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh records five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily rate
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the largest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that as of yesterday, 114 cases had been registered and 33 recoveries were in the home.
Seventeen deaths have been recorded.
The Director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, told an online news conference that the deaths included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirgadi, there were two cases over the age of 60, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41 and 50.
She also said two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
An official at a hospital told Anadolu, a local news agency, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saif Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Authority, who was receiving care at Kuwait’s Maitrey Hospital.
Bangladesh's Minister of Land Transport and Bridges, Obaid al-Qader, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transport would be halted for longer than initially planned until Saturday.
The disruption of public transport began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of basic commodities is still allowed: medical products, fuel and food.
The first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Bangladesh on March 8 for two people returning from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
The three had already recovered by March 19.
The number of SARS-CoV infections exceeds 2 million worldwide
Data released by Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, exceeded 1 million worldwide.
The coronavirus-induced COVID-19 disease has caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first coronavirus infections, and the first associated deaths were recorded in Zambia.
North Korea has claimed that as of Thursday it is one of the few countries still free of coronavirus infections.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced 10,51635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours preceding 10 a.m. (0800 UTC) on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the United States, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing Johns Hopkins University data, reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by the coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobianin announced on Thursday the extension of the city’s closure until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians would continue to be paid salaries without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions, and one against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the cities of Mecca and Medina to be extended throughout the day, where it was previously from 3 p.m. to only 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike De Wayne, has announced that the state has extended the order to stay at home until May 1.
Australia Stores Reduce Terms of Purchase of Toilet Paper for Every Transaction
The Australian Wallworth and Coles stores series on Saturday and Sunday evening stressed restrictions on buying toilet paper to cut it to two rolls from Wallworth stores and one roll from Coles stores per transaction in all branches nationwide.
Aldi's stores also identified one roll, so on Monday.
These purchase restrictions have been posted as messages at payment points in store chains and on their Facebook pages.
It has been reported that buyers have been storing it due to concerns related to COVID-19 in case people need self-isolation.
Wallworth’s stores on Wednesday approved restrictions on the delivery of toilet paper to homes to become one roll per purchase order.
These changes follow previous restrictions passed by Wallworth Stores on March 4 and Coles Stores on March 5, allowing the purchase of only four rolls per transaction.
In a March 8 press release, Coles reported that despite the application of the four roller restrictions, “many stores still sell all they have within one hour of receiving it,” and described the order as “unprecedented,” as well as Aldi’s in a Facebook post on Tuesday as “unexpected.”
Sales increased “significantly” last week, according to Wallworth’s spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also determined that the quantity allowed to buy was two rolls.
To alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered suppliers for larger rolls and increased delivery frequency, Wallworths also ordered additional inventory, while Aldi made available its inventory for Wednesday’s scheduled special offers early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but the local council’s restrictions on when trucks were delivered were making it harder.
Higher production costs are expected, as suppliers try to meet demand, with fewer special offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi’s stores announced that due to the early availability of inventory, some stores would not be able to offer a special Wednesday offer.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said in a report to News.com.au that stores fill stores every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large-scale commodity, which leads to reduced inventory in terms of numbers, and when it is sold in full, it leaves large empty spaces on the shelves, fostering a sense of lack.
Russell Zimmerman, reported by ABC News, said: “Colls and Wallworths have the view that if there is a lot of goods on the shelves, and if products such as toilet rolls and sterile rolls can be purchased and supplied in large quantities, that may reduce panic.”
Who Gives a Crap, which produces recycled toilet paper, reported last Wednesday that its inventory was running out.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Clinix Toilet Wipes, and Solaris Piper, which produces Sorbent Wipes, have confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue supplying their products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, noted that some real estate vendors offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at Melbourne auctions, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday’s edition of the daily newspaper NT News, published in the city of Darwin, included eight-page ads that could be cut and used as toilet paper.
Shops initially hesitated to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, where stores reported they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including masks, sterilisers, dried goods, handwash and flour.
In the same vein, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that a British online store named Okado identified the purchases of toilet paper by Andrés with two 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says COVID-19 is a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, has reached the epidemic level.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the disease, not to the severity of specific cases, WHO has noted the need to prompt governments to take the necessary measures:
“All countries can still change the course of the epidemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “If countries discover, treat and isolate people, track their cases and mobilize them for confrontation.”
“We are all very concerned about prevalence levels and alarming risk levels as well as alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, this pandemic is “unprecedented.”
In comments published by CNN in February, he said, “No other respiratory virus has been tracked from the onset of emergence to the ongoing global spread, other than the flu.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view: “We have never been exposed to an epidemic caused by a coronavirus before.”
“We’ve never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the World Health Organization’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, said of the outbreak: “The bottom line is that things will get worse.”
According to the Associated Press, there are at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in around 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate in China was estimated at 4%, while globally it ranged from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is supportive and symptomatic treatment. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining interpersonal space, monitoring, and self-isolation of those suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world are responding to this threat by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine, curfews, workplace hazard controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global social and economic turmoil, delaying or cancelling sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by buying panic.
Schools and universities have closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting around 99.4 percent of the world’s student population.
There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, and other areas where there have been significant cases of the virus.
As a result of the reduction of travel rates and the closure of heavy industries, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan City (capital of Hubei Province) China reported a range of cases of pneumonia for an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely associated with bat coronaviruses, coronaviruses in squamous ant-eaters, and SARS-CoV. The market later revealed that the first person with symptoms had developed on December 1, 2019.
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report published by South China Morning News reported that a 55-year-old case from Hubei Province dated November 17, 2019, may have been the first case. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that despite the decline in reported new cases in China, the number of new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea rose for the first time.
There may be a significant lack of reporting of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By February 26, a relatively small number of cases had been reported among young people, with adults aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Valance estimated that 60% of Britons needed to become infected before effective herd immunization.
The cases refer to the number of people who have undergone a COVID-19 test and have been confirmed to be infected in accordance with official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test only for those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China as of January 23, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79 percent of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of cases in Italy was much higher than the recorded cases.
Preliminary estimates of the primary reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who are not recovering, the period from worsening symptoms to death takes between 6 and 41 days, the most common of which is 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, COVID-19 caused about 97,000 deaths.
As of February 5, nearly 80% of deaths in China were concentrated in people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of COVID-19 deaths generally indicate deaths from COVID-19 that have been confirmed as covid according to official protocols.
The real number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without testing – for example; at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of COVID deaths recorded by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that “we know that [the number of deaths] reflects a lower estimate than reality,” a statement supported by narrative reports that indicate inaccuracy in the United States. Such underestimations occur in cases of pandemics such as the H1N1 swine influenza pandemic in January and January 2009.
The first death outside mainland China was on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths outside mainland China had been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to determine the mortality rate.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options and time taken since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health. The mortality-to-injury ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality-to-injury ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of deaths from infections fell from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures refer to the CFR mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those who died from illness, and the CFR mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those who died from illness.
These statistics do not have a time frame and track a specific population range from injury to knowledge of the fate of the condition.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific population groups.
The Oxford University Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall epidemic mortality rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range corresponds to the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, and to a statistical study analysing the effect of the test on estimates of the mortality rate of cases.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stresses the possibility of controlling the pandemic.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Massage Bonnie of Pennsylvania State University said: “An outbreak of infectious diseases that are left uncontrolled usually reaches a peak and then begins to decline when the disease doesn’t find available hosts.
“But it’s almost impossible to make any logical prediction now about when that will happen.”
China's top medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said it "could end by June" if all countries could be motivated to follow the WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kocharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Hot Zone Medicine stated that the SARS-CoV-2 "will be ubiquitous perhaps for a year or two".
According to a study by Neil Ferguson of the Imperial College of London, we will need to rely on physical distancing and other measures “until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus will completely disappear—because it’s easily transmissible—and could “turn into a seasonal disease—so it comes back every year.”
The ferocity of return will depend on collective immunity and the extent of transformation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecified and may not show symptoms in the infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory phlegm discharge, loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or blistering. The World Health Organization confirms that almost one person among six suffers from difficulty breathing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has limited emergency symptoms to difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden disruption, difficulty waking up, face or lips blurring. Immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms occur, acute constipation and constipation. The progression of the disease can lead to acute pneumonia, psoriasis, and syndrome.
Some patients who do not have clinical symptoms may not have symptoms but the results of the tests confirm their incidence, so specialists have advised that people who are in contact with confirmed cases should be monitored and screened closely to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic cases range from few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (between injury and onset of symptoms) ranges from 1 to 14 days; it is often five days. As an example of confusion, the segment of people with COVID-19 who initially lost their sense of smell was estimated at 30% and has recently declined to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still under consideration.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during mixing or through spraying when coughing, sneezing or talking; when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without covering the mouth can result in a spray that spreads from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some argue that the virus may also be transmitted by long-term airborne spray, which may be produced while speaking. It may also produce respiratory spray during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally airborne.
The spray may fall on the mouths or noses of nearby people or be inhaled into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be released in the form of a spray and then spread through the air.
It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spreading from the stool to the mouth, the risk is thought to be limited.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from stool to mouth. The virus is more infectious during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms and during later stages of the disease.
People have been shown to have the disease up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting a possibility of transmission before severe symptoms appear.
There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) stresses that despite some ambiguity about how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three people in general. The virus remains on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend hand washing after contacting animals, as is the case when touching other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
Coronavirus 2 associated with acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia who were in contact with a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares all its properties with the coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, home soap kills the virus, where its protective membrane is dissolved. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely related to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to have animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus genetically meets the genus of the beta-coronavirus and falls under the subgenus of the coronavirus Sarpy (strain B) as well as two bat-derived strains.
96% at the entire genome level matches other bat coronavirus samples (Pat Cove Rat G13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between squamous ant-eating viruses and human-derived viruses.
A complete genome comparison to date has resulted in the discovery of a maximum 92 percent share of genetic material between the ants-eating coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that ants-eating is the intermediate feeder of the virus.
HIV infection can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately done through the RTTR-BCR (Reverse Replication Polymerase) reaction of infected secretions or computerized tomography.
A study in Wuhan comparing serial polymerase interaction with computerized tomography suggested that computerized tomography is more sensitive than serial polymerase reaction, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with pneumonia and other pathological stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiography recommends “not to use computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or consider it a preliminary screening to diagnose the disease.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2 for the first time on January 17.
The test uses a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTT-BCR).
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally done with a nasal pharyngeal swab, and a swab from the throat can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serum tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been proven sufficiently accurate to be widely used.
A Celex-developed serum test has been certified for emergency use in the United States only in accredited laboratories.
Radiation imaging and computerized tomography (CT) characteristics of people with disease symptoms include asymmetrical terminal opacity such as labeled glass fog and distorted crystalline leakage.
The Italian Radiation Society collects an international online database of imaging results for confirmed cases.
Radiation imaging without a serial polymerase reaction is a limited-accurate procedure for detecting COVID-19 because it interferes with other diseases such as adenovirus infection.
A large study in China compared the results of computerized thoracic tomography and serial polymerase reaction and showed that although the imagery is less accurate in terms of proof of injury, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it is considered a screening tool in infected areas.
AI-based convergent neural networks have been developed to detect the characteristics of virus imaging in both radiography and computerized tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing hands, avoiding contact with the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a napkin when coughing or sneezing and then disposing of it by throwing it directly into the trash.
Those who already carry the infection are advised to wear a medical mask in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned unnecessary travel from and to countries and regions affected by the outbreak or advised not to travel.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading throughout society in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they have been infected. Health care providers, who care for a person who is likely to be infected, are advised to use significant measures, precautions for mixing and eye protection.
The use by governments of cellular location data to track privacy has raised concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for such surveillance to be restricted.
Many mobile apps are designed or offered for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups have worked to find privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they approach someone who has been confirmed to have COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are promoted; for example, washing the nose and gargle with mouthwash is not a viable solution.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet, although many organizations have been working on a vaccine.
It is advisable to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when dirt appears on their hands, before eating, and after emptying their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because home soap kills the virus outside the body; it destroys its protective membrane.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommended using a hand sterilizer that contains at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected using several disinfectants (within one minute of disinfecting the stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% iodopovidone.
Other disinfectants, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, exist with less effectiveness.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that when a person is suspected of covid or confirmed in an office or care centre, all places such as offices, bathrooms, shared spaces and shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by the patient should be sterilized.
Health organizations recommended that people cover their mouths and nose when coughing or sneezing either by bending the elbow and putting it in front of the mouth and nose or using a paper towel and getting rid of any wipes immediately.
People who are likely to be infected are advised to use medical masks, as wearing the mask reduces the size of the respiratory spray and the distance it travels when scattered by talking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “wearing a mask can reduce [people’s] desire to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if your hands are not properly cleaned.” People who take care of people who are likely to become infected are advised to use the vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthy people should wear masks only if they are at high risk of infection, such as caring for people with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have started encouraging ordinary people to wear face masks.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made of cloth. China specifically recommends the use of medical masks that can be discarded, especially if people are directly contacted (at a distance of 1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned entry to public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government required everyone who entered a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel asked all residents to wear masks in public places.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has demanded passengers on trains and buses to wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made it necessary to wear a face mask when out, while also recommending making face masks at home for those who can’t buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing interpersonal mixing.
Roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging touchless greetings, and physically distanced from others.
Many governments currently impose or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no outbreak of COVID-19 in the region is detected) to 50 people, and 10 people later.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings for more than two people. Older people and those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension, and weak immune systems are facing a risk of disease or other serious complications. The World Health Organization (WHO) is advising them to stay at home as much as possible.
The use of the term “social distancing” has suggested that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes recommendations that you only have sex with someone you live with who is not HIV-positive or who has symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have imposed or recommended self-quarantine for all populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions were issued to those of the most at-risk groups.
Those who have dealt with a person with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where the infection is widely transmitted are advised to be self-quarantine for 14 days from another time of possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or curbing and limiting the spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at tracking and isolating the infected, as well as introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it becomes impossible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Inhibition requires more rigorous measures to reverse the course of the epidemic by reducing the basic number of reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of outbreaks of infectious diseases attempts to reduce the peak of the epidemic, in what is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of straining health services and saves more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may treat an outbreak include personal protective measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-quarantine; community actions aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling large gathering events; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces have become clearer; stricter measures have been taken.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass tests and local quarantine, and issued alerts on the movements of the injured.
Singapore has provided financial support to those injured who have isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased masks production and criminalized the stockpiling of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing rather than halting the spread of the epidemic) and curbing (reversing the growth of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and stress on health systems.
Inhibition may be preferred but should be maintained as long as the virus spreads to humans (or until the vaccine becomes available, if this happens first), as the transition on the other hand bounces quickly when measures are mitigated.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may aggravate the results.
Many of the compounds previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are subject to screening for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also reported that some "traditional and domestic therapies" can provide relief of symptoms caused by SARS COVID-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting health care centers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients have been described by the World Health Organization as key measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health-care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, abolishing optional procedures as far as possible, separating and isolating people with COVID-19, increasing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There are multiple theories about where the first condition (so-called patient zero) originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Bhube, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus came from one of these species; in other words, it has an animal origin. A group with pneumonia was observed at the Zheng Puang County Center for an unknown cause on December 27 and dealt with by Dr. Zhang Zhijian Hubei Hospital.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues against the SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wen Liang, were alerted by police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fein, was reprimanded by her superiors for triggering the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Committee subsequently issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia have been reported to health authorities in Wuhan, prompting them to start the investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus moved to other Chinese provinces, with the help of movements during the Chinese New Year and for the Wuhan transport hub and intersection of major railway lines.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data announced later shows that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, there were reportedly more than 1.61 million cases worldwide, with more than 3,000 deaths.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have registered at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National reactions included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, cover-up orders, or closures) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, had been subjected to a form of closure in the United States, more than 50 billion people in South Africa, and about 59 million people were subjected to closure in the Philippines.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide underwent a form of closure, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jishian observed a range of cases of pneumonia caused by an unknown on December 26, and informed her hospital of the Centers for Disease Control in Jianghan Bohan on December 27.
An initial gene test for patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Committee issued a public notice on December 31.
The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on the same day.
In the presence of these notifications, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police about “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of person-to-person transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping later described as a "popular war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a health collar was announced on January 23 to stop travel from and to Wuhan, extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
Private vehicles are banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in several places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hooshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was then built, Lishenshan Hospital, to deal with additional patients.
In addition to the newly established hospitals, China has also transformed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including providing health advertisements to travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools have also been closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote action measures have been taken in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions inside and outside of Hubei have been imposed.
Public transport has been modified, and museums have been temporarily closed across China.
Public movement has been tightened in several cities, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) have been subjected to a form of exit restriction. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities took tough measures to prevent the virus from being “bringed” to them from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all returnees to the city from other countries. On March 23, one case was moved locally in mainland China over the past five days, by a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang announced that the spread of locally transmitted infections and the control of the outbreak in China would be declining.
Travel restrictions in Hubei were eased on the same day, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the closure was imposed. On 26 March 2020, China’s Foreign Ministry announced the suspension of entry for visa or residence permit holders from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy will expire.
Those wishing to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government has urged companies and factories to resume work on March 30, offering a set of monetary incentives for companies. The State Council has announced a three-minute day of silence on April 4, at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government has called on families to show respect online, taking into account physical distancing to avoid a new COVID-19 outbreak.
The transmission of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on Feb. 20, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shinchengyi Church of Jesus.
It was suspected that Shinqiungi’s followers visiting Daegu from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 people, or about 13% of 9,336 church followers, reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest levels of preparedness on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers were infected with the virus.
Flight timing has also been affected, and so changed. South Korea has implemented the world’s largest and best-organized program to screen people for the virus, isolate any infected, and track their contacts and put them in quarantine.
The methods of screening included mandatory personal reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through the mobile app, testing the virus on people in their cars the next day, and increasing the testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
The South Korean program represents a success in controlling the outbreak despite not applying quarantine to entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment, alleging the government’s mishandling of the outbreak, or hailing his response.
On March 23, it was announced that South Korea had the lowest total cases in one day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be subject to a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries to help test the virus.
Iran reported the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 19 in Qom, with two people dying later on the same day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early actions announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, institutes of higher education, and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on February 26, 2020 that there is no plan to stone the affected areas, and only individuals will be isolated.
Plans to limit intercity travel were announced in March, although heavy intercity traffic continued before the new Persian year of Nuruz.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a center for the spread of the virus after China.
Amid allegations of Iran’s coverage of the outbreak, more than a dozen countries tracked its cases returning from Iran as of Feb. 28, suggesting the extent of the outbreak could exceed the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to date.
Iran’s parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly infected on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch demanded the unconditional release of human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as the temporary release of qualified prisoners.
She stated that there is a high risk of spreading the virus in indoor spaces such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government announced 100 deaths in one day, the largest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 Iranian politicians and current and former government officials have died from the disease by March 17.
By March 23, Iran had recorded 50 new cases per hour, with one death every 10 minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases in Iran may be five times higher than what has been announced.
It is also believed that U.S. sanctions on Iran may affect the country’s financial capacity to respond to the virus outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) has called for economic sanctions to be eased on the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed in Italy on January 31, when the SARS-CoV-2 tests of Chinese tourists in Rome were positive.
Cases began to increase sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights from and to China and declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated group of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Cabinet announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak, including quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “He will not be allowed to enter or exit the outbreak areas.
On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country, with 100 deaths in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Premier League matches, were scheduled to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Reanimation, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy outperformed China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths from the pandemic.
On March 22, Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of April 5, 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recovered in Italy, most of them in the Lombardy region.
A combination of a large number of elderly people and the inability to test all people infected with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as the most lenient among affected countries, and as of March 18, 2020, the UK government had not imposed any form of social distancing or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for its noticeable lack of speed and severity in responding to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising to avoid unnecessary travel or social contact, proposing to work people from home as much as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants, and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that it would close all recreational facilities such as bars and gyms as soon as possible, promising to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a maximum of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to reduce unemployment in time of crisis. On March 23, the prime minister announced stricter social spacing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activity.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police by issuing fines and dispersing rallies.
Most companies have been ordered to close, with the exception of "necessary" commercial projects, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and garages.
On January 20, the first known case of COVID-19 in the state of Washington, Northwest Pacific, was confirmed to a man returning from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Task Force to Combat the Coronavirus was set up on January 29.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed restrictions on entry for travelers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) — the leading public health institute of the U.S. government — announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States slowed down in the start of the test, obscuring the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test corrupted a flawed test set produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval for non-governmental test kits (by academia, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restricted criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (the doctor's order was subsequently required).
By February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, the Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: “Many people who have had symptoms and have an order from a doctor waited hours or days for the test.” After reporting the first death in the United States in Washington State on February 29, Governor Jay Insley declared a state of emergency, a measure quickly followed by other states.
Schools in Seattle cancelled schooling on March 3, and by mid-March, schools across the country had closed. On March 6, 2020, the United States was informed of projections regarding the impact of the novel coronavirus on the country by epidemiologists at Imperial College London.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Supplementary Credits Act to Prepare for and Respond to the Coronavirus, which provided emergency funding to federal agencies of <0x24>8.3 billion to respond to the outbreak.
Companies imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences, and urged employees to work from home.
Activities and sports seasons were cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions for most of Europe, excluding the UK, for 30 days, effective March 13.
The next day, the restrictions were extended to include the UK and Ireland.
On 13 March, a national emergency was declared, which allowed the use of federal funds to respond to the crisis.
As of March 15, many companies have closed or reduced their working hours across the United States in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On 23 March, 10,700 coronavirus cases were reported in New York City, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said social distancing appeared to be a success, with estimates showing a slowdown of cases doubling from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people died from the virus. On 26 March, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, 400,335 cases were confirmed in the United States, and 12,841 people died.
According to media reports on March 30, US President Trump decided to extend social distancing directives until April 30.
The same day, the USS Comfort, a hospital ship with about 1,000 beds, landed in New York.
On April 3, the United States recorded 884 deaths from the coronavirus within 24 hours.
In New York State, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 people on April 3. The White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and controlling news circulation by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public data and HIV-related publications with the office of Vice President Mike Pence.
The Trump administration for the crisis has not received universal approval as it has generated wide-ranging inter-party polarization.
Some U.S. officials and commentators have criticized U.S. reliance on imports of essential materials, including essential medical supplies, from China.
The analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict prevalence patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on information from IATA 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the largest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne have also been reported as popular destinations for travelers from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least capable among more than 20 popular destinations in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered more capable. Australia released its emergency response plan for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on February 7.
She said not much has yet been discovered about the COVID-19 virus, and that Australia will emphasize border control and communication in its response to the pandemic.
On March 21, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.
Due to the impact of effective quarantine in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the region, primarily through chartered flights from their countries of origin, with Chinese authorities providing permits.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first countries to plan to evacuate their citizens.
Pakistan has announced that it will not evacuate any of its citizens from China.
On February 7, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians or family members, along with four Poles, a Chinese and an Indian national.

On the same day, 215 Canadians (176 from the first aircraft and 39 from the second aircraft chartered by the U.S. government) were evacuated from Wuhan to the Trenton Canadian Forces Base to isolate them for two weeks.
On February 11, another aircraft carrying 185 Canadians from Wuhan landed at the Trenton Canadian Forces Base.
Australian authorities evacuated 277 citizens on Feb. 3 and 4 to the Christmas Island detention centre, which was re-used as a quarantine facility, where they stayed for 14 days.
A New Zealand evacuation flight arrived in Auckland on February 5, and its passengers (including people from Australia and the Pacific) were isolated at a naval base in Wangabarawa, north of Auckland.
On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate Americans who were on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess.
On February 21, a plane landed in Trenton, Ontario, carrying 129 Canadian passengers transported from the Diamond Princess.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On March 14, a South African airliner chartered by the South African government returned 112 South African citizens.
The pre-departure medical examination was carried out, and four South Africans who showed signs of the coronavirus were left to mitigate the risk.
South Africans whose test results were only negative were returned.
Test results showed that South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, all of whom remained, as a precautionary measure, under surveillance and quarantine at Ranch Resort for 14 days, uninjured.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, China’s Foreign Ministry reported that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad, Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students at U.S. universities have come together to send aid to the HIV-infected areas of China, and a joint group in the Greater Chicago area reportedly managed to send 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei County on January 30. Humanitarian Aid sent Direct Relief hospitals, in coordination with FedEx and Junction, 30,000 face masks with other personal protective equipment, including eyebrows.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates pledged <0x24>100 million to the World Health Organization to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts, as well as to protect “at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia.”

On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it would send <0x24>2.26 million in aid to China.
Japan donated 1 million face masks, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia sent more than 13 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan, Malaysia announced 18 million medical gloves to China, Germany delivered several medical supplies, including 10,000 protective suits, and the U.S. donated <0x24>100,000 to China.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where they were distributed by the African Union.
He later sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 artificial respirators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 test kits for the coronavirus made in China, which was only 30% accurate, and in the meantime, the Netherlands returned 600,000 flawed face masks made in China.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable facial masks that were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
Parts of Latin America and Africa, on the other hand, welcomed the well-received Chinese aid. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) praised the efforts of Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, with Chinese authorities accused of obscuring prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, with the central government providing “regular updates to avoid panic before the Lunar New Year holidays.”
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to enforce the transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gooden Gallia noted that while this was “not certainly a recommendation made by the World Health Organization (WHO)”, it was once “a very important indicator of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where the disease is highly concentrated.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General said that the outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern due to “the risk of global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that “there is no reason to take measures that are unnecessarily incompatible with international travel and trade” and that “the World Health Organization does not recommend limiting trade and mobility.”
On 5 February, the World Health Organization (WHO) appealed to the international community to contribute <0x24>675 million to the strategic funds set up in low-income countries, noting the urgent need to support those countries that “do not have systems to detect people living with HIV, even if it appears.”
Tedros also made statements in which he declared that “our strength is measured by the strength of the weakest of us” and urged the international community to “invest today or pay a great price later.” On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the disease, at a news conference, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to present “the potential of the entire United Nations system to respond.”
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Team has been set up, allowing the entire United Nations response to be coordinated, and WHO will allow it to “focus on the health response while leveraging the expertise of other agencies to learn the broader social, economic, and development impacts of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team with China was set up to provide international experts and experts from the WHO on the ground in China to assist in local management and assess the “seriousness and transmissibility of the disease” by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and to carry out field visits to the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess “the impact of response activities at the provincial and urban and rural levels”.
In response to the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "very high", which is its highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, warned in a statement that “this is a real test for every government on Earth: so we have to be prepared.
The virus may be on its way and you have to be prepared for it," he said, urging correct response measures that could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan also stated that current data do not justify public health officials declaring the disease a global pandemic, saying such an announcement would mean "we basically accept that every human being on the planet will be exposed to the virus."
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a coronavirus outbreak as an epidemic.
The Director-General said that WHO is “deeply concerned about the alarming levels of prevalence, severity, and alarming levels of inaction.” The World Health Organization has faced severe criticism of what is seen as inadequate treatment of the pandemic, including the delayed declaration of a public health emergency and the categorization of the virus as an epidemic.
A petition by WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom for his resignation was signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts affirmed respect for everyone’s rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Group of Experts stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the government bears this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, members of minorities, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extremely poor conditions, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups that need government support.
Intergovernmental organizations address the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as perspectives and advice.
From strengthening health systems and the global economy to address the impacts of closures and travel restrictions, the digital axis includes a state policy tracking tool, aimed at helping countries learn from each other and facilitating a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove and Eduard Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for the way it deals with the pandemic, which began in China’s Hubei province.
Several CPC directors have been dismissed at a cross-sectoral level for handling quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of resentment over the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting CPC secretary general Xi Jinping from public dissatisfaction with the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example Zhao Lijian, have rejected a previous admission that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favour of conspiracy theories led by the United States or Italy regarding the COVID-19 virus.
The U.S. Donald Trump administration called the coronavirus a “China virus” or “Wuhan virus,” saying China had “imposed a blackout on the news that has exacerbated the virus, which is now a global pandemic,” which some critics have criticized for being racist and “distracted from its administration’s failure to contain the disease.”
Daily Beast received a cable from the U.S. government reviewing the communications scheme with clear sources in the National Security Council, with a strategy stating that "it's all about China.
We were asked to pursue and disseminate these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. “News sources such as Politico, Forensic and Bloomberg claimed that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push for global influence.
EU foreign policy official Josep Borrell warned of a “geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through the practice of circumvention and generosity policies.”
Burrell also said that “China is strongly pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it is reportedly sending aid to the last two countries.
U.S. sanctions banned Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of transferring aid to other countries.
There have been reported masks disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of artificial respirators aimed at Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Mauricio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “China has responded only bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin equipped the Russian army to send military paramedics, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an unnamed "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "unhelpful or unhelpful to Italy".
The source accused Russia of launching a “geopolitical and diplomatic” attack.
Lombardi President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the press reports and expressed gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “When assisting his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are active again, they will also be able to repay the favor if necessary.”
NATO’s planned “Defensive 2020” exercises will take place in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest war exercise NATO has conducted since the end of the Cold War on a small scale.
The secretary-general of the denuclearization campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the 2020 gun training, saying: “With the current public health crisis, training puts not only the lives of troops from the United States and many participating European countries at risk, but also the populations of the countries it will conduct.” The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about twenty members of parliament infected along with fifteen other former or current political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public message to world leaders on March 14, 2020, asking for help, saying that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak because of lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies that are common in other rich countries, including higher public funding and health care, comprehensive childcare, and family leave.
Political analysts predicted that this could adversely affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan’s “mysterious and negative quarantine efforts” after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined in certain government locations for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have either signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment for alleged mishandling of the outbreak or for applauding its response. The pandemic allowed states to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to tighten their control of power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who spread false information about the virus and the government’s handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak, which has led to many shortages of supplies due to the increasing global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of factories and logistics operations, has been blamed.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about a shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and discontinuation of suppliers.
Many areas have also seen panic-driven purchases, resulting in the shelves empty of basic groceries such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing shortages of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection tools has increased by 100 times.
This demand has raised prices up to twenty times the normal price and also delayed medical supplies for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective tools around the world, with the World Health Organization warning that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for Diego shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the ensuing high demand for food products, the two regions survived acute food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy to combat the storage and illicit trade of bio-products have prevented severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy's large agricultural production has not seen a significant decline, but prices may rise according to industry representatives' expectations.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to keep stocks for such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, China’s economy was severely damaged in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 percent.
As mainland China is a major economic and industrial hub, it has been observed that the outbreak poses a significant and destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demares of the Economic Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until a clearer picture of possible outcomes emerged.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic repercussions of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those that occurred as a result of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis estimated the global supply chain was affected by more than <0x24>300 billion, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly experienced a "disruption" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to a decline in demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a dramatic rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including the Nasdaq-100, Standard <0x26> Poor's 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded their biggest decline since 2008, with Dow dropping 1,191 points, its biggest one-day decline since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week down by more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings confirmed GMPH China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained negative outlook.
Stocks fell again due to concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest drop was on March 16.
Many believe that a recession is possible.
The economist Mohamed Al-Arian praised the emergency measures taken by central banks and countries in a timely manner.
Central banks are responding faster than they were in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, closures of public places including tourist attractions, and warning governments against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China East Airlines, and Kants, while the British regional airline, Flybe, collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry has been at an unprecedented level.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the spring holiday travel season known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of large crowd events, including New Year’s celebrations, with private companies also closing their stores independently and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Several Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including Beijing’s Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, and in municipalities and districts in China, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and instructed most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, shutting schools until March and cancelling New Year’s celebrations. The global retail sector has been affected by reduced store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a decline of between 50 and 60 percent.
This also led to a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increasing hygiene, installing heat scanners to check shoppers’ temperatures, and cancelling events. According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC), the stagnation caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 million and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America less than they would have suffered.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s approximately 300 million rural migrant workers were trapped in their homes in the interior provinces, or in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could be as high as 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The closure in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid by daily pay cuts) unemployed as many as 9,000 in the midterms. The survey by the Angus Reed Institute found that 4% of the households were unemployed.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers on short-term government-backed work plans known as Korzarbet.
France and Britain adopted a German short-term labor compensation scheme.
The theatrical arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals – workers and independents – globally.
The Arts and Culture Sector Foundations sought to support its (often government-funded) mission to provide access to the cultural heritage of society, maintain the safety of its employees and the public, and support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition venues and other cultural institutions around the world have been closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events, and shows have been cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent and accelerated repercussions of the disease include the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a pause. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian Repentance Season of Lent.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available on radio, live online or television, while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and church chapel, and the evacuation of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also abolished limited public services and gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogue temples, temples, and gordwara.
Iran’s health ministry announced Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak were cancelled and subsequently closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as its residents from entering the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the biggest disruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 European League, the 2019-20 NBA and the 2019-20 National Hockey League.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was due to start at the end of July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event “will be rescheduled beyond 2020 but no later than summer 2021.” Gambling clubs and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live gambling tournaments have been postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to switch to online gambling, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theaters like those on Broadway have suspended all the shows as well.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue to produce and share the work online as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live concerts or creating online “celebrations” for artists to perform, distribute, and publish their work.
Many online memes about the coronavirus have spread on the Internet as much has turned to humor and entertainment in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, extreme bias, xenophobia and racism have been observed towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
The February reports (when the majority of cases were still confined in China) documented racist sentiments expressed by different groups around the world towards Chinese that they deserve the virus or receive what is allegedly justified punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination because of their territorial origin.
There has been support for the Chinese, both online and offline, and for those living in areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak has spread in new hotspots, people from Italy, the first European country to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, may experience skepticism and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed pressure petitions to prevent Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan is released on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuses, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for referring to the coronavirus as a “Chinese virus,” a term critics have seen as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from northeast India, which shares the border with China and who study in major Indian cities, have been harassed by the coronavirus outbreak.
BJP unit in West Bengal state Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese destroyed nature and “that’s why God took revenge on them.”
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned these statements, describing them as “wrong”. In China, the pandemic has led to increased xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners being described as “foreign garbage” and targeted “to dispose of them.”
Many newspapers have removed subscription paid pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made available scientific papers related to the outbreak to open access.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

The 2019 Respiratory Coronavirus Test (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 include methods to detect the presence of the virus where you recognize antibodies that are produced in response to infection.
RT-BCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where it detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is accurate and only designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm cases of very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serumology) is used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to report or those who did not show symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to the limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population.
On March 23, no country examined more than 3% of its population, and there is a significant difference in the number of tests conducted by different countries.
This variance is also likely to significantly affect the reported mortality rates, which in some countries are likely to be overestimated.
Using an instantaneous polymerase sequence reaction of reverse transcription (RTT-BCR), the examination can be performed on respiratory samples obtained in various ways, including a nasal pharyngeal scanner or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-BCR, which is administered with throat swab, is only used in the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people undergoing screening in the second week, a sample of deep airways can be taken by suction catheter or using a cough (sputum).
One of BCR’s early tests was launched in Berlin’s Charité in January 2020 using the RTR-BCR instantaneous replication sequence polymerase reaction, and formed the basis for 250,000 testing kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech also created a PowerChek Coronavirus detection kit for SARS-CoV-2 suitable for safe clinical use and reliant on BCR on 28 January 2020.
Looking for the "E" gene in which all coronavirus beta and the RdRp gene for SARS-CoV-2 are common. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from the China National Medical Products Administration for SARS-CoV-2 detection kits based on the PC-RAS 2019.
One of the three genetic tests in the older versions of the test kits resulted inconclusive results due to flawed reagents, and one stage of testing was delayed from the other at CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in the successful completion of an average of less than 100 samples per day throughout the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not trusted until February 28, 2020, and until then government and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The FDA approved the test under emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States started testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, Lab Corp announced the availability of a COVID-19 test nationwide based on RT-BCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics allowed COVID-19 testing across the country as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; the sampling process must be carried out and processed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the State Center for Virology Research and Biotechnology created and produced the COVID-19 test.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Healthcare Surveillance Service registered the test. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large numbers in 3.5 hours, allowing a single machine to perform approximately 24 hours over a period of 4128 tests.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use permission (EUA) to Abbott Labs for testing on the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA previously granted a permit similar to H.L. Corp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Civid obtained an emergency use permit similar from the Food and Drug Administration in favor of a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses the technique of equal-heat DNA amplification instead of BCR.
Since this does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Approximately 18,000 of these machines are currently in the United States and Abbott expects an increase in manufacturing for 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is also developing a test that uses a single-celled antibody that is particularly linked to the nucleic acid (NN) protein of the new rapid coronavirus, in the hope that it will be able to achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results may be obvious even before symptoms appear."
Typical characteristics that appear in computed tomography include two-sided, multilobe glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical and backward distribution.
Spread under the pleurisy develops and irregular patches appear and intensify with the development of the disease.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR and computerized tomography regarding the origins of the current pandemic suggested that PCR is more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with pneumonia and other pathological stages.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiography recommends "not to use computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or to consider as a preliminary screening to diagnose the disease". In March 2020, the CDC recommends using the BBCR for the preliminary screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect individuals during a period starting 7 days or after symptoms appear, to determine immune capacity, and in the case of population monitoring. Analysis can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or by testing the clinical care point (BOCT).
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratories, a single sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although consecutive samples can be used to follow up the immune response.
For a clinical care point test, a single blood sample is usually withdrawn by perforating the skin.
Unlike BCR methods, the extraction step is not required prior to testing. On 26 March 2020, the FDA identified 29 entities that had notified the Agency according to the requirements and therefore were able to distribute their antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one test under emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European credits for their test kits, which can detect antibodies to IgG and IgA in blood samples.
The test completes several hundred samples in a matter of hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional BCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the infection begins. In early April, the UK discovered that the antibody test kits it purchased were not good enough to use.
Hong Kong has developed a plan whereby patients suspected of infection can stay at home, “Emergency Department is given a sample tube for patients,” spitting in the tube, and retrieving it to get the test result after a short while. The NHS says it is testing the appropriate ambulatory ambulatory ambulatory ambulatory ambulatory ambulatory ambulatory ambulatory.
In-car testing centers enabled South Korea to conduct a range of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world. In Germany, the National Association of Physicians of Legal Health Insurance stated on March 2 that it was able to conduct about 12,000 outpatient tests per day and 10,700 people underwent testing last week.
Health insurance will bear the costs if a doctor orders the test.
According to the chairman of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, in-car testing was made available in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only positive cases were reported.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that, starting with the calendar week 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples were tested at the end of the week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital devised a method for screening 64 samples.
With Wang Jian, founder of BGI, overseeing the construction and taking five days into it, modelling has shown that Hubei cases would have increased by 47% and related quarantine costs would have doubled if that testing capability had not been completed.
Wuhan Laboratory was immediately followed by the establishment of Huo-Yan Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and in 12 cities in total throughout China.
By March 4, 2020, total daily productivity reached 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays has released open source and multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1,122 patient samples to detect COVID-19 using only 93 screenings. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without the need for automated fluid treatments.
In March, the lack and inadequacy of reagents caused a dilemma when a large number of tests were conducted in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This prompted some specialists to explore sample preparation protocols that included heating samples at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE was at the top of the world in terms of the rate of coronavirus testing for most of its population.
This was through a combination of in-car testing capability activation, and the purchase of a super-productive lab with a range that fits the population of Group 42 and BGI (depending on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
The laboratory was created within 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of RT-BCR tests to be conducted daily, and is the world’s first laboratory of this magnitude operating outside China.
Different methods of testing have been devised targeting different parts of the genetic characteristics of the coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German kit industry plan for low-income countries that do not have the resources to invent their own kits.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was not available until January 28, delaying tests available in the United States. China and the United States faced problems regarding the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, which were not provided by experts from both countries and Australia.
In contrast, experts say that the abundance of tests in South Korea has helped curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has greatly enhanced test capability in private laboratories over several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for the intensification of testing programs as an optimal solution to curb the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.Increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus has resulted in hundreds of thousands of tests accumulated in private US laboratories, as well as the supply of wipes and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, “defects” were found in CDC’s test kits; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that specifically prevented testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Ltd., but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or not to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would reverse the purchase of kits that gave incorrect results, and would replace them with other test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x87> proposed to throw it into the Danube. Professor A<0xC4><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and had "prevented their use". The UK also bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 it declared them unusable.
The tests, followed by a quarantine of those found to be infected and the tracking of contacts with SARS-CoV-2, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Foo, which saw Italy’s first COVID-19 death, tested the entire population of about 3,400 people twice, taking about 10 days at a time.
There were no symptoms in nearly half of the people whose test results were positive, and all cases detected were isolated.
As a result of the ban on movement between towns, new infections were completely eliminated.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has seen a significant decline in prevalence compared to other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail facilities, through strict contact tracking, domestic travel restrictions, tests and quarantine.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has already started urging residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 on schedule after the holidays.
Several other countries have also controlled the pandemic through strict contact tracing and restrictions on domestic travel, tests and quarantine, but with less stringent closure decisions, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries that have carried out more tests, compared to the number of deaths, have far lower mortality rates, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect those who only have mild or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries that do not have the ability to carry out tests or have local laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send the first five positive and the first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO-approved laboratories to confirm the test.
Of the 16 certified laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the “positive % of tests” column is affected by the state’s policy of conducting the test.
The country that performs tests only for those admitted to the hospital will have positive cases that are 10% higher than the country that performs the tests for all its residents, whether they have symptoms or not, considering that the other factors are equal.
Handwashing (or hand washing), also known as hand cleaning, is the process of cleaning hands for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Constant hand washing with soap at certain “necessary times” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anal pathway.
People can also develop respiratory diseases such as influenza or a cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
These include the five necessary moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s ass or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be washed with ash. WHO recommends hand washing:
Before preparing food, during it, and after it.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing a baby’s diaper or cleaning it after using the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, feeding them, or their excrement.
Medical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Handwashing before giving medication or providing medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to disinfect the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who are handling food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, preventing diarrhoea-causing infectious diseases, and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduced infant mortality rates at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices may lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by nearly a third, which is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of diarrhea attacks can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARA) when applying spontaneous behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, killing about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together cause about 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an inherent habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhea deaths by nearly half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programs (water, sanitation and hygiene).
Hand washing also protects against herpes that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A simple harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of peel and itching known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Handwashing is also often seen too much as a symptom of OCD.
There are five necessary moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral anal tract: after using the bathroom (pissing, defecating), after cleaning the baby’s back (change diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating, before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
The correct hand washing method should be practiced in other cases in order to prevent transmission of the disease, including before or after treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal excrement, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate, estimated at 97%, the United States approaching the middle with 77%, and in China with the lowest possible 23% of children’s daily handwashing behaviors.
The “Basic Health Care Program” implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of widespread action to promote children’s health and education.
Twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap, and daily tooth cleaning with fluoride, worm treatment is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water promotes the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soap and detergent is to reduce the barriers of decomposition, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective antiseptic for the skin because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not easily decompose in water.
However, the flow of a proper amount of water helps to disinfect.
Hard soap, due to its reusable nature, may carry bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies that have observed a bacterial transition from contaminated hard soap have concluded that the transition is unlikely because the bacteria are washed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to state that “liquid soap is preferable to use from devices that work without touching to pump soap.”
Antibacterial soap has been widely promoted to health-interested consumers.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or sterilizers is selected to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of strains of organisms.
Therefore, if antibacterial soap does not affect antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it is marketed.
Along with superficial stress reduction and skin protection agent, sophisticated formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as regulators of acidity and benzoic acid. The antimicrobial active P-acetylated benzoic acid contains P-acetylated antimicrobial enzymes or other skin moisturizers (Cacter, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts).
Hot water suitable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, warm water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural oils that retain dust and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or hand sterilizer is a substance that has no water-based cleaning of hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-aqueous alcoholic hand sanitizers sterilized through rubbing (also known as alcoholic hand sanitizer, disinfectant hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol compound with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for ease of use and minimize the effect of alcohol dehydration.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sterilizers containing alcohol by at least 60 to 95% are effectively bactericidal.
Alcohol sterilizers through rubbing eliminate bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus and vancomycin-resistant intestinal components), tuberculosis, and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory cell viruses, nasal viruses, flu).
Alcohol sterilizers that contain 70% alcohol through rubbing eliminate 99.97% (logarithmic reduction of 3.5, similar to a 35-dB decrease) of the bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after placing them and 99.99% to 99.999 (logarithmic reduction of 4 to 5 percent more effective against some of the bacteria on the hands.
Alcoholic hand sterilizers are almost completely ineffective against Norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of gastritis caused by infection. Enough manual disinfectant or alcohol rubbing should be used to wet or completely cover both hands.
The front and back of the hands and between all fingers and limbs are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel drys.
Fingertips should also be thoroughly washed and rubbed in both comforts. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with a hand sterilizer, especially when the hands are clearly dirty.
The increased use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and rapid activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol hand sterilizers can cause skin to dry unless emollients, skin moisturizers or both are added to the composition.
The effect of alcohol on dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other rainforests or both to the composition.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol hand sterilizers containing rainbows cause less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Seldom occurs allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives found in alcoholic handwash materials.
Reduced susceptibility to irritable contact dermatitis has become an attraction compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite the effectiveness of detergents that are not water-based, they do not disinfect hands from organic matter, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sterilizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sterilizer depends heavily on the ingredients and composition, and historically its effect has been significantly lower than that of an alcohol-based hand sterilizer.
Recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and continuous antimicrobial effect after their use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, possibly due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but they may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dust or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, like soap, is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of ash or sand as a substitute for soap when it is not available.
The correct hand washing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
The use of running water is recommended because existing basins may be contaminated, and at the same time the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference.
Make foam on your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands and between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of just water.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
The rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and removes the rubbing for longer periods of more germs.
Rinse well under running water.
Washing hands inside the pelvis may cause them to be re-contaminated.
Dry with a clean towel or leave it to dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are easily contaminated again. The most common parts that are overlooked are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail paint may contain microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands, dry skin can cause damage, which may increase the risk of transmission.
Different low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand washing in developing countries, where tap water, soap, or both are not available, such as pouring water from a suspended pot or punching appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to streamline water consumption, such as "faucet".
Tape Tape is a simple technique that uses a rope-hanging jar, a foot-powered control arm to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand cleaning process, but there is some controversy about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of research suggests that paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Symposium on Paper Towels, to compare the levels of hygiene provided by paper towels, warm air hand dryers, and newer air jet hand dryers.
After washing hands and drying them with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased on average on the soles of your fingers by 194% and on the palm of your hand by 254%.
Drying using a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the soles of the fingers by 42% and on the palm of the hand by 15%.
After washing your hands and drying them with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the soles of your fingers and on the palm of your hand decreased by 76% by 77%, and scientists conducted tests to determine whether there was a likelihood of transmission to other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which pushes air out of the unit at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to inflate microorganisms from the hands and the device, and the infection may be transmitted to other toilet users and the toilet environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
Using a warm air dryer spreads microorganisms 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant prevalence of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers are matched by drying with paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sterilization wipes is an alternative during travel due to the lack of soap and water.
An alcoholic hand sterilizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory for a long time after the Hungarian physician Agnats Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found lower incidence rates of using it.
Medical hand washing should be for at least 15 seconds, using abundant amounts of soap, water or gel to make foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together and fingers intertwined.
If there is feces under the fingernails, a brush with rough hair can be used to remove them.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids contaminating hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the place of health care is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“bacteria”) and avoid their transfer.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of handwashing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to routinely wash their hands before touching patients, transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of bloodstream infections associated with the catheter by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization published a paper explaining how to wash hands and rub them in healthcare sectors.
The draft hand hygiene guidance document submitted by the organization can also be found on its site available for public comment.
Whitby and others conducted a related review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if necessary, to demonstrate compliance with the regulations.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has “five moments” for hand washing:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before a sterilization mission, and
After treating patients. Adding disinfectant chemicals to the soap ("medical" or "antimicrobial") adds an insecticide to the handwashing agent.
This element of extermination may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. When someone rubs their hands for surgery, a faucet that can be turned on and off without touching them with their hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine lotion, and other sterile towels for hand drying after washing.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and ankles up to the elbow, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
The long period of rubbing (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, water should be prevented from refluxing from the ankles to the hands.
After washing hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical dress is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand disinfectant before and after taking care of a sick person.
In order to control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of manual disinfection was found to come from the first 20% of the laundry, and it gained very little additional benefit when the frequency of hand-cleaning increased to more than 35%.
Regular soap washing results in more than three times the rate of food-borne bacterial infectious diseases compared to antibacterial soap washing. Comparing hand rubbing with an alcoholic solution to hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, alcohol rubbing has been found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol handwash to reduce H1N1 influenza virus type A and hard-handed pawns. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include educating employees about hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol handwash, and written and oral reminders to employees.
More research is needed to find out which of these measures is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as an essential tool at an affordable cost to achieve good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to come up with general hand-washing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand-washing taps are rarely found near every private or public toilet, although there are cheap options to build hand-washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can be caused by inherent habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating hand-washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing, and lead to long-term change in the behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in lower-income middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF’s “three-star approach” to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When minimum standards are met, schools can move from one star to three eventually.
Building hands-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing promotion campaigns conducted to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that are trying to bring about behavior change. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries and its relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people who are in critical conditions such as newly born mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand-cleaning pioneers: the Hungarian physician Agnats Simelvis, who worked in Vienna in Austria, and the modern English-born Florence Nietingel.
Most people at the time still believed that the infection was due to the unpleasant odors called Miyazam.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and healthcare-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more effectively as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect the soul from these infectious diseases.
For example, labels containing “the right hand washing methods” were hanged next to handwashing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
“Handwashing” means declaring one’s unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to participate in complicity in it.
It stems from a passage in the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase that is much more widely used in some English societies.
In Shakespeare’s play, Mrs. Macbeth begins to wash her hands in an attempt to purge a spot of fiction that represents her guilt for the crimes she has committed and the crimes she has urged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after referring to or thinking about unethical acts, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to appreciate hand washing tools more.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other “clean” compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Religions describe hand washing for both health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water without soap for hand washing, is part of the hand washing rituals that have emerged in many religions, including the Baha'i and Hindu doctrines.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam impose hand washing after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing before and after every meal.
COVID-19 Risk Controls in the Workplace
Workplace COVID-19 risk controls are the application of Occupational Safety and Health Risk Control Methodologies to prevent COVID-19.
Proper workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and job function, based on assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the risk of disease in society, and risk factors that threaten working individuals who may be at risk for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work involves minimal communication with the public and other co-workers, a situation in which basic procedures for preventing infections are recommended, including hand washing and encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, coughing and sneezing, and maintaining practices.
Jobs with a moderate risk of exposure include those that require frequent or close communication from individuals who are not known to have or suspected to have COVID-19, but may become infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have communicated with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with high labor density, and some large retail outlets.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing barriers, and the use of personal protective equipment available in case of dealing with a person with COVID-19.
Occupational Safety and Health Department considers health care workers and the body portfolio of a person known to have or suspected to have COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to extremely high levels if workers are carrying out aerosol generation procedures, or collecting or handling samples from a person known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Adequate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment suitable for the job.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others, or fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the quality of the goods requested, and the ways in which they are obtained (such as shopping outside of peak hours or through delivery or shopping services without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may cease. The preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive action.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and job functions, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also sets out the necessary controls to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The goals of the disease response include reducing the transmission of infection among employees, protecting people most at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business processes, and minimizing the negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the society in which business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to classify risk controls by effectiveness.
As COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution in terms of implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in employment policy or actions that require action by an employee or employer.
PPE equipment is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some exposure.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected based on the worker’s hazard, proper suitability as appropriate (e.g. respirators), continuous and proper wear, inspection, maintenance and replacement regularly, as necessary, removal, cleaning, storage, or disposal properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that involve less risk involve minimal communication with the public and other co-workers.
Recommended basic procedures for preventing infection for all workplaces include frequent and complete hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, coughing and sneezing etiquette including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing paper napkins and other cleaning and garbage containers, and preparing to work remotely or organize work shifts in a row if necessary.
Immediate identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that staff with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until the fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms go away for at least 24 hours without using anti-fever medicines or other medications that improve symptoms, and that staff members have family policies that are flexible, and allow staff to stay at home.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, occupations with a moderate risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or close communication within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals who are not known or suspected of COVID-19, but who may develop SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing transmission in the community around the workplace, or because a person has recently travelled to an international location.
This includes workers who contact the public as in schools, high-density work environments, and some retail locations of large size. Customers’ and high-risk controls include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of material barriers such as plastic sneezing protectors, and the installation of windows for customers.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes sick on an aircraft, appropriate prevention controls to protect other employees and passengers include keeping the sick passenger away from others by 6 feet, assigning one member of the aircraft team to serve the sick person, providing the sick person with a face mask or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with paper wipes when coughing or sneezing.
The crew must wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and possibly use additional personal protective equipment if the patient has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable objects should be disposed of in the biological risk prevention bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and sterilized afterwards. For commercial cargo, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include delaying travel when sick, self-isolation and prompt reporting to the medical center on board if someone has a fever or other symptoms on board during the flight.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person’s cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure of cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is present in the school building regardless of the prevalence in the community.
When there is a limit on transmission in a community of limited to medium range, social distancing strategies such as cancelling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes, band lessons or dining in the canteen, increasing office spaces, organizing consecutive attendance and departure times, reducing unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office for children suffering.
When there is a significant transmission of infection in the community, in addition to social distancing strategies, it is possible to take school breakouts into account. For law enforcement officials who carry out daily routine activities, the direct health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must contact confirmed or suspected individuals with COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as medical emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of direct contact during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect work belts and tools before reuse using a spray or household cleaning wipe, and follow standard working procedures for handling pollution and disposing of used personal protective equipment and for collecting and washing clothes.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration believes that some health care workers and body portfolios fall into categories with high or very high risk levels.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratories, and medical transport providers who are exposed to known or suspected patients with COVID-19.
These become extremely high-risk levels if workers perform aerosol generation procedures, as well as collecting or handling samples from confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19.
Procedures for the generation of aerosols include induction, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures and tests, or invasive sampling.
The functions of a high-risk body portfolio include workers who are involved in preparing the bodies of confirmed or suspected persons with COVID-19 at the time of their death; those with a high level of risk become extremely high if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these at-risk groups include the generation of isolation rooms for known or suspected patients with COVID-19.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare settings and the preservation of dead bodies.
Samples should be handled using level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolating patients arriving in separate waiting areas based on whether or not they are suspected of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Department recommends using respirators for those who work at a distance of 6 feet from known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients.
In the United States, facial mask respirators with a N95 filter, accredited by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or better devices, must be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes composition and suitability testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve workers’ comfort. The WHO does not recommend the use of apron, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only the use of a surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
For those collecting, caring for, or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, the World Health Organization recommends using a surgical mask, glasses, or face protection, pants and gloves.
If the aerosol generation procedure is performed, the face mask is replaced by a breathing N95 or FFP2.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment through telemedicine and physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a patient with COVID-19, using and coordinating personal protective equipment that is only necessary for the specific task, and continuing to use the same respiratory mask without removing it during many care.

Subject line: [COFID 19] Relieve the burden and prepare for the future
Date/Time: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No Rights Reserved
We found ourselves in the midst of extraordinary circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic has become something that clearly demonstrates the global human interdependence and responsibilities we have towards others.
Our history has never seen similar challenges, but we know for sure that the best response is based on a kind of global empathy, collaboration and community building, which are firmly anchored at the heart of this institution.
The intense friendship and care we have witnessed among all our colleagues through emails, calls, and conversations is an astonishing practical proof of the amazing human feelings that, fortunately, surround our way of doing business.
I am very grateful and deeply proud to be true colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a letter to express their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how crucial the world is to be able to turn to Wikipedia at the moment, and the powerful symbolism that this critical resource remains available online and a kiss available to all.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it’s through the continuation of the site’s work, our colleagues’ payroll, or the provision of safety to our communities.
The world needs information on Wikipedia more than ever before.
It’s a moment when the positive impact in the world is not just on our efforts, but on how they are done.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make major adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Modifications to the working method and timetables
As Robin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our way and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we looked at what we saw could be the appropriate response to what we are facing, and the ideal way to maintain the sustainability of the organization’s business during this period.
We wanted with great enthusiasm to get rid of stress and stress, and to support our long-term mission.
If you want to reduce your burdens and tasks, that’s fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working time is 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We’re not advocating for a holiday, and if you’re able to work longer than usual hours, your efforts may add to the task.
However, world conditions are now unpredictable, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get groceries or go to a doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We don't track your times.
If you are sick, do not work.
Allowing this to be understood without expressing it, but we mention it as a confirmation.
No sick or paid leave is required, just inform your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to make sure you cover key business areas.
(If your doctor diagnoses you with COVID-19 positively, please tell Brian at the Training and Certifications Department so that the Training and Certification Department can provide support and ensure that your condition is adequately cared for by the Department.)
Fellows who work hourly receive their full salary.
We have already mentioned this, and we renew this commitment to our contractors and our hourly colleagues.
Each employee will be paid based on normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes whether the employee is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work to overcome the pressures that are rampant in the world around us.
What we can do will be fruitful in an amazing way, especially during difficult times like this.
Again, it’s about taking care of oneself.
We only ask you to contact your manager so that he can know what to expect and adjust the procedures to adapt accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
There are also some things that we need to keep going.
Site reliability engineering teams, HR operations, trust, trust, fundraising (and others) are doing critical work, which may require more support.
We will start a process in collaboration with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There’s a lot of work we all need to do, and we’ll focus only on the most important projects.
Going slower now, it won't hurt us later.
We don’t plan to “double the work time to fix what’s late” after the pandemic ends.
It is not expected that we will work extra hours to meet deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept the fact that these circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new targets and timetables when appropriate.
What Happens in Annual Planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and forecasts of daily working hours, we intend to adjust our delivery schedule for our annual planning for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose to extend our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time for budget design to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and care for loved ones while reconciling those who need or want to work within a reduced working time schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension on the timeline alleviates the current planning workload and pressure across the entire organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Board next week and will inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
We thank the annual planning team for its leading role in this matter.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
We learned last week that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, out of extreme caution and prohibition, we hired a virus-resistant cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team has used a class-of-virus resistance solution used in hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator units that lead to our own floor.
The building implemented its own care duty protocol using products that support tenant safety.
We feel comfortable that the office is conveniently ready until we decide to go back to work.
Our office in Washington, D.C. is located in a building belonging to WeWork, which shared with us its COVID-19 protocol and with all members of our team at our headquarters in Washington, D.C.
Starting last week, our office in Washington, D.C. has moved to a completely remote location under the guidance of our office in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues at our headquarters in New York City know, we had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
Those discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it may be an adjustment, and they would like to give you some advice:
Meeting time should be limited to a maximum of one hour or gradually increased to two hours.
If it takes longer sessions, think about how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, an agenda should be prepared, and materials for reading should be sent in advance.
Video should be made the default solution, and use tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
Each meeting should be facilitated, and one person should monitor the conversation to find out questions and track the list of speakers, and another person to help take notes (or implement the collaborative notes process).
An email should be sent to technical support when you need comfortable headphones.
The health and safety compensation program can be used to get the cost of snacks.

Our Human Resources Operations team is looking for user-friendly guidance based on online meetings to support the increase in business across our organization.
Over the past week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel all Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Editathon website editors, until the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the end of the pandemic.
We have informed them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete agreed grant activities, and that no one will be fined for having to delay or modify these goals.
Next week we will issue additional follow-up guidance on Wikimedia and other regional community conferences and specific topics.
The general sentiments that prevail in the global community are confused between sadness due to turmoil, satisfaction with clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In light of the progress made in these actions, the Crisis Response Team is working on a page on MetaWiki to provide a community space to monitor impact and follow up on all contacts with it.
Stay informed about COVID-19-related topics
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC, 07:00 Pacific Time for the Working Group meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer questions and spend time communicating between us.
We go through this experience together and are always ready to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we can continue to obtain information from this email, and all other necessary information related to COVID-19 available at Office Wiki.
The Crisis Response Team will keep these pages updated and all information will remain in one place.
We also maintain regular contacts with staff residing in severely affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, major events, business areas, coverage challenges or anything else you need help with, please feel free to inform us and collaborate with our Crisis Response Team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please send an email to Brian Gooden, Director of Global Human Resources Operations.
Any such change shall not be deemed to be a renouncement of the work entrusted to us or the obligations incumbent on us.
Instead, it is a realization in this present moment that our work and commitments need to adapt to situations in a way we have never experienced in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work, provide our employees with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they depend on.
The work that we have planned to accomplish will be waiting for us when it is time to be done.
Now is the time to help each other and create a space for important work that will come in the coming weeks and months.
We need all of you to achieve this, so we need all of you to take care of yourself and your families to be at your best when your efforts are needed.
Please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, Director of Crisis Response Team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jamie V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant A, Heather W, Jamie V, Janine U, Lisa S.
The angiotensin 2 converted enzyme (ACE2) is associated with the outer surface (cellular membranes) of cells in the lung, arteries, heart, kidney, as well as intestines.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme counteracts the action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7); making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is also an entry point for some types of coronary viruses to the cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is known as a metallic enzyme that contains a zinc element and is located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The angiotensin 2-converting enzyme protein contains the M2 peptidase scale with an amino tip, and the Carboxylic Colectrine tip transporter chain for renal amino acids.
Angiotensin 2 converted enzyme is a single-pass membrane protein of type 1, with active enzyme receptors present on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The outer part of the cell range of the angiotensin 2 converted enzyme is separated from the membrane by an enzyme called chidase, resulting in the release of a soluble protein into the bloodstream and then excreted through the urine.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is found in most organs of the body: it is linked to the cellular membrane of type 2 sungal cells in the lungs, in the small intestinal cells, and in the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in the smooth muscle cells of the artery wall in most organs.
The transmitting RNA of the enzyme converted to angiotensin 2 is found in the cortex, sytome, hypothalamus area, and brain stem.
The primary function of the converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 is to act as a balancer of the converting enzyme of angiotensin.
The transformed enzyme of angiotensin stimulates the conversion of angiotensin 1 hormone to angiotensin 2 vascular coagulant.
In contrast, the angiotensin 2-converting enzyme separates the carboxylic amino acid-containing phenyl-alanine from angiotensin 2 (aspartite-arginine-valine-tyrosine-isolysine-hestylene-prostylene-benzidine-alanine) and analyses it into angiotensine.
The angiotensin 2-converting enzyme is separated into a number of other peptides, including [Des-Arginine9] - Pradrikinin, Abeline, Neurotensin, Dinorphen A, and Ghrelin.
The angiotensin 2-converting enzyme also regulates the membrane passage of a neutral transporter of neutral amino acids equivalent to SLC6A19, and plays a role in Hartnob disease.
As a transmembrane protein, the main cell entry for certain coronaviruses, including the human coronavirus NL63, SARS CoV (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the association of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 with the enzymatic range of angiotensin-2-converting enzyme on the surface of the cells leads to cellular sequencing and transmission of the virus and enzyme to internal particles located in the cells.
This insertion process needs to configure S by the host's cross-membrane protease enzyme, Serin2, which is still inhibited as a potential treatment. This makes some assume that lowering the levels of the angiotensin 2-converting enzyme in the cells may help to resist infection.
However, many specialized associations and self-regulatory bodies recommend continued use of the usual angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as a treatment.
A systematic study and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was accompanied by a clear 34% lower risk of pneumonia compared to the reference group."
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia decreased among those who received treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and who were at greater risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke or heart failure.
“The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has led to a reduction in deaths from pneumonia, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia.”
The recombinant human angiotensin 2 transformer enzyme (rhACE2) is thought to be a new treatment for acute lung injury, it has been found to improve the distribution of lung blood, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory dyspnoea induced by polyglycerides.
The half-life of the recombinant angiotensin 2-transformer enzyme is approximately 10 hours, while it starts working after 30 minutes, as well as its continued effectiveness (period of time) up to 24 hours.
There are many indications that the recombinant angiotensin 2 converted enzyme may be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to traditional angiotensin resonance inhibitors (RAS inhibitors), and in diseases associated with an elevated angiotensin 2 in the blood. Clinical trials are under evaluation, of the effect of the angiotensin 2 infusion.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications specifically designed to help track people contacted in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have contacted an infected person.
Numerous applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some provinces and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed to design applications to track contacts.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, especially about systems that rely on geolocation tracking for app users.
Less intrusive alternatives to privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they could integrate a functionality that supports these Bluetooth-based apps, directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government in collaboration with Alipay has published an app that allows citizens to verify whether they have contacted people with COVID-19.
It is an application used by individuals in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, individuals use an app called TraceTogether.
The application has been designed by a local IT association, released as an open source application and is scheduled to be delivered to the government. North Macedonia has launched the "StopKorona", a bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected individuals and provide a quick response to health care authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, has taken over the design of the application.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still waiting for the approval of the Google Play Store and the App Store from Apple.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking app was in advanced development and may be available for distribution within weeks.Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar app, the “StopCovid” (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are both considering designing applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app, as well as the Blue Tris protocol.Russia plans to launch an app that uses the virtual geographic ocean for patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 from Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave the house.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has cited a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including pseudo-positive cases and potentially ineffectiveness if the use of applications is confined to only a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious coronavirus apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that could add coronavirus-related apps to its app store, limiting them to “official” or other reputable organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance resulting from the use of Coronavirus applications, particularly as to whether or not the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the Coronavirus pandemic will disappear as soon as the threat ends.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Extensions of monitoring and surveillance should include provisions relating to the time limitation of their stopping;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related purposes;
Data security and identity confidentiality should be protected and proven on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid further discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing with outside parties should be determined by law;
Factors of protection against abuse and protection of citizens’ rights should be provided to address abuses;
The “effective participation” of all “stakeholders involved”, including public health experts and marginalized groups, is required. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also issued review lists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the ongoing monitoring problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operating systems as soon as it is needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and allowing to avoid tracking.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
But network-based solutions that have access to primary site data have potentially significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with centralized servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy-keeping systems have been created that use centralized servers only for interconnections (see the next section below).
In South Korea, officials used a non-app-based system to carry out contact tracking operations.
Instead of using a custom application, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking and card transaction data, and includes this data to send notifications via text to individuals with potential infections.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made the location information publicly available, which was allowed due to wide-ranging changes to information privacy laws following the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in that country.
This information is available to the public via a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, have considered using both centralized systems and privacy.
On April 6, 2020, the details of this issue have not yet been released.
Privacy-keeping contacts are an applied and successful concept, backed by strong research papers dating back to at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked to reach privacy-friendly solutions, such as low-power Bluetooth (BLE) to record user proximity to other cell phones.
However, BEP-BT was a coordinating effort that included both centralized and decentralized approaches, not an individual protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized approach tracking, privacy-preserved (DB-BPT and DB-3T), mobile phone tracking, mobile phone tracking (DB-BPT and DB-T), and temporary contact numbers (TCN), formerly known as CN.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data does not leave the device, and all matching processes occur on the device.
MIT Media Lab’s privacy group was developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-keeping technologies when collecting location data or crossing pathways and using them to track the spread of COVID-19.
It draws on research from the March 2020 “Bad Face of Apps: Preserving Personal Privacy in the Face of the Epidemic” report. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a technology developer for privacy that was originally established at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and administrators without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global Contact Number Tracking Coalition was founded by groups focused on what was a fundamentally similar approach and highly overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing dispersion and enabling global interchangeability between tracking and alert applications, a key feature for achieving widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had made the Blue Tree Protocol, which is used by the official government application, open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control the mobile operating systems Android and iOS, announced an initiative to track contacts, claiming that they will maintain privacy by combining low-power Bluetooth with privacy encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main techniques used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to roll out the system in three phases:
Introduce tools to enable governments to create official, privacy-keeping apps to track coronavirus
Integrate this functionality directly into Android and iOS as Google and Apple plan to solve ongoing usage and monitoring issues by first distributing systems through operating systems updates and then by removing them in the same way as soon as the threat ends.
Repossession (also known as re-use, re-allocation, change of target or therapeutic transformation of the drug) is to redefine the use of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than was originally designed to treat it.
This is a method of scientific research that researchers are currently pursuing to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research trends include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of transaminase plasma.The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains approximately 66 drug-treatable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
Analysis of these ASEAN sites provides a reasonable plan for the development of an effective antiviral drug that eliminates COVID-19 proteins.
Among the critically important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papal-like protease, RNA-based RNA polymerase, helicase, S-protein, and adenosine-diphosphate-rebo-phosphate phosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., has studied many of the candidate compounds that have subsequently undergone improvement and analysis for their structure similar to the approved drugs with the highest similarity, with the aim of accelerating the development of a strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in his pre-clinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is a malaria treatment drug that doctors also use to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine could be among the four drugs studied as part of a clinical solidarity trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could begin on March 24.On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use License (EAA).
The treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and was licensed under an emergency use license only as an experimental emergency treatment to treat patients who had been hospitalized but were unable to receive treatment in the clinical trial.
The CDC announced that it had not yet determined "the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention, treatment, dosage or period of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
Doctors said they were using the drug when “there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are conducted at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
The University of New York’s Langon School of Medicine is conducting an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that Favipiravir was "definitely effective".
Of the 35 patients in Shenzhen, the test results were negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given vafiberavir and the other half received omefenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency has alerted people that the existing evidence supporting the drug is incomplete and primary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to include it in its reserve inventory, and would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Newspaper, Shinzo Abe has held preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug.The drug may be less effective in treating the most severe cases as the virus has already doubled.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who want to get pregnant.
One study using Lupinavir/Ritonavir (Calitra), a combination of antiviral combinations of Lupinavir and Ritonavir, reported that the results "did not detect any benefit".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV to prevent it from cloning by binding it to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to access a compound associated with the SARS-CoV-2 protease.The scientific community is experiencing a state of criticism about channeling resources to redefine the purpose of drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has added Lupinavir/Retonavir to the experience of international solidarity.
Gilead Sciences has developed the drug Remdesiver as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences has subsequently discovered that Remdesiver is actively antiviral in vitro against many nematodes, mucosal viruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through transitions that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early pre-clinical studies suggest that Rimedesiver may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several current clinical trials, including two conducted by the University of Cleveland hospitals, one on patients with intermediate disease and the other on patients with the most severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of antiretroviral vitamin C in patients who have been hospitalized with acute COVID-19 disease, as well as two controlled trials using placebo (China, Canada) and an uncontrolled trial (Italy).
New York State began trials on the antibiotic effect of azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial on the use of Alvisco (cyclosonide) produced by Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid to treat asthma, to treat patients with the novel coronavirus before symptoms appear.
A Phase II trial is currently under way using a form of an angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 in 200 patients who are required to join the trial from acute hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of Colchisin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, named Colcorona, included 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms without having to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women, who are breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not qualified.
Many anticoagulants are also tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is currently widely used to treat patients, which requires the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidance on its use.
A multicentre study in Italy in 300 patients was announced to investigate the use of sodium enoxaparin in doses for disease prevention and therapeutic doses on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientific attention has focused on the reuse of approved antiviral drugs that have been designed to deal with previous outbreaks such as the Mars virus, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Specialists recommend using ribavirin to treat COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese Directive
Omifenovir: Specialists recommend the use of omifenovir to treat COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese Directive
Some of the antibiotics that specialists have identified are likely to be reusable as COVID-19 treatments include:
Tocilizumab (anti-interleukine receptor 6): Certified by China.
Experiments in Italy and China as well. See <0x23>Covid-19 tocilizumab.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a presumed vaccine against 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
Although no vaccines have been completed for clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five candidate vaccines in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A large outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to significant investments and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genome to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations Initiative for Vaccine Development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, widespread deployment and global reach.
In April, scientists from the Coalition for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform that advanced to the first phase of the safety studies include:
DNA (MRD and RNA) (stage I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (stage I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, adenovirus carrier type 5)
According to Coalition scientists for epidemiological preparedness innovations in April, there are 115 total vaccine candidates in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more announced, but with little public information (presumably in the planning or design phase).
Phase I and Phase II trials carry out an initial safety and inhibition test, usually randomized, randomly controlled, and in multiple locations, with more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve a larger number of participants, including the reference group, and a vaccine efficacy test to prevent the disease, while monitoring the negative effects of an optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (still under “preclinical” research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan’s VIDO-InterVac announced the start of work on a vaccine, targeting the start of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28, 2020.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Haniki Schweitzer, announced that they had begun working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a study on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that used to treat cancer with an antigen vaccine created.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had finished manufacturing the vaccine and that they had begun testing.
On February 27, 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it had begun a vaccine project to synthesize the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a candidate vaccine that could be tested in humans “within 90 days.”

On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Equipment Command at Fort Derek and the Walter Reed Military Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in Western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had formed a team with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for preclinical tests and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even as the pace of action accelerated it would take at least a year and a half to nearly two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported that it was developing a Coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is undergoing laboratory research, with plans for testing in humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “significant sums of money” for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government had protested.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to partner in the development of a vaccine based on sending RNA.
The candidate BNT162 RNA-based vaccine is currently undergoing preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takes Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would receive the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that the final candidate vaccine could start testing in humans by autumn.
In France on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations (CEPA) announced a <0x24>4.9 million investment in a Covid-19 Vaccine Research Consortium, which includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, prompting a total <0x24>29 million U.S. pandemic preparedness innovation alliance investment in the development of a Covid vaccine.
Coalition partners for epidemiological preparedness innovations to develop the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curvac, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started animal testing for six different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-amplified RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C<0x24>275 million in funding for 96 research projects on COVID-19 medical countermeasures, including several candidate vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C<0x24>192 million specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national “vaccine bank” from several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests of PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "sub-unit vaccines of SARS-CoV-2 administered with microscopic needles triggered strong responses to specific antibodies from 2 [in mice]."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo College of Pharmacy announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on hypoxic RNA as a potential nasal spray.
Using phages, hypoxic RNA will be designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called unspecified effects.
This means that they can have benefits that go beyond the disease they are fighting.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the efficacy of the vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as genetically modified mice with angiotensin 2 enzyme, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggests the need for Tier 3 biosafety measures to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Anti-SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no preventative treatment or vaccine for SARS that has been proven to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.
When March spread, existing research on SARS was thought to provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against Mars-Cove infection.
As of March 2020, there was one vaccine for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (based on hypoxic RNA) that completed the first phase of clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are under development, all of which were viral-oriented vaccines, and two vaccines for adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS), MVAC-VRS-M.
Social media posts have raised the conspiracy theory that the virus that caused COVID-19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited in many social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other strains of coronaviruses such as the SARS-causing coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is infected by Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, olfactory loss, and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases show mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million people in 210 countries and territories were reported infected, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during mixing, often through splash spray when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When the spray is dispersed during exhalation, it usually falls on the ground or on surfaces rather than being infectious over long distances.
People may also get infected when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more infectious in the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although it may spread before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the reaction of the polymerase serial to the intratemporal reverse transcription (RTT-BCR) through a nasal pharyngeal swab.
Masks are recommended for those suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the general use of masks vary, with some authorities recommending not to use them, some saying otherwise, and others saying that they should be used.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may not have symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical attention is advised if emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest area, disturbance, difficulty waking up, or blue face or lips appear.
In less common cases, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, running nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Initially, some cases in China only suffered from chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who have symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.Reports suggest that symptoms may not appear in all people.
The role of symptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease has not yet been fully recognized; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is under study, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases showed no symptoms during their hospital stay.
China’s National Health Commission began listing asymptomatic cases in its daily inventory on April 1; out of 166 cases that day, 130 (78%) of these cases showed no symptoms at the test.
Sputum and saliva may carry large proportions of the virus.
Talking loudly produces more spray than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without covering the mouth could lead to a spray that spreads up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
Although the virus is not usually transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted by bioaerosols, and screening samples of air collectors in the lobby outside of individuals’ rooms has resulted in positive results of viral RNA.
Certain medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be released in the form of a spray, and the virus then spreads through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through stools, the risk is thought to be limited.The virus is more infectious when people have symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some ambiguity about how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three people in general. The virus remains stuck on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, it was found that the virus remained present for one day on the cardboard and for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene), stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature.
Soap and disinfectants are also effective provided they are used properly; soap dissolves the protective fatty membrane of the virus and stops its work, as well as clearing the skin and other surfaces from it.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are available with less efficacy.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken after an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of the test, the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a novel coronavirus associated with acute acute acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people suffering from pneumonia in Wuhan’s acute respiratory disease group.
The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus shares its properties with related coronaviruses found in nature.
Outside the body, home soap eliminates the virus, destroying its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the two organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells by the angiotensin 2 (ACE2)-converted enzyme, which is the most abundant in the type II sungal cells found in the lung.
The virus uses a special superficial glycemic protein called spike (Vulvial Sect) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, had severe heart attacks, which were more common in critical cases.
The rates of cardiovascular-related symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but acute heart muscle injury may also be associated with ACEA2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors play a very important role in the heart and are involved in the performance of its functions.
The rate of clots (31%) and intravenous blood clots (25%) in patients in the intensive care unit with COVID-19 increased, which may be associated with poor prediction of the outcome of the condition. The autopsy of individuals who died from COVID-19 was found in disseminated synaptic damage (DDD), and inflammatory intracellular infiltration.
Despite the SARS-CoV-2 trend towards respiratory ACE2 epithelial cells, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it has been shown that pathogenic T-cells that excrete GM-CSF are associated with bringing in the only cells that excrete inflammatory interleukin 6 and exacerbated lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
It was also reported that there was a lymphatic infusion at the autopsy.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several testing protocols for the disease.
RTTR-BCR is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually performed using respiratory samples taken from a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or Blem sample can also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it requires two blood samples with a two-week difference and the results are of simple direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and spread the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop PCR tests to detect the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect an active infection and whether or not a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experiment on the test showed that the accuracy was only 60 to 70 percent.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical care point test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Chungnan Hospital at Wuhan University have proposed ways to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Double-sided, multilobe glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and backward prevalence are common features at the beginning of the injury.
Spread underneath the lateral and form of a stone axis (thickness of the lobotom barrier with uneven singe filling) may appear and merge with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
Key pathological findings from autopsy:
Microscopic examination: Pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary hyperplasia and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pulmonary cell hyperplasia, untypical large synchial cells, transient inflammation with lymphatic infusion and multi-core giant cell formation
Acute pneumonia: Pervasive synaptic damage (DAD) with pervasive synaptic secretions.
Pervasive synchiatic damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of secretions in singular cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: circulating intravascular coagulation (DIC); white blood cell reaction
Preventive measures include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eye, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, and it is recommended to use the inside of the attachment if a napkin is not available.
It is recommended to clean your hands thoroughly after any coughing or sneezing.
CDC has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public places, partly aimed at reducing the transmission of asymptomatic infections. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The spacing guidelines also include people at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.
There is no drug known for its effectiveness in preventing COVID-19. Since the innovation of a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as “curve flattening.”
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
It is also recommended to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, when soap and water are not only available.For areas where commercial hand disinfectants are not easily available, the World Health Organization (WHO) offers two formulations for local production.
Antimicrobial activity in these combinations arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial stains in alcohol; it is "not an effective hand disinfection substance".
Add glycerol as a moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
External membrane oxiga (ECMO) is used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under study.
Personal hygiene and reliance on a lifestyle and a healthy diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of infection. WHO and China’s National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of those hospitalized because of COVID-19.
Intensive care professionals and lung specialists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various bodies in a free resource, a critical case care book available online.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 was available.
For symptoms, some specialist doctors recommend the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that may result in spraying, such as intubation or manual breathing.
For health care professionals who care for COVID-19, CDC recommends placing the person in the isolation room from airborne infections (AIIR) as well as using standard precautions, mixing precautions and precautions for diseases transmitted by HIV. CDC explains guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (BPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended tools: personal protective equipment apron, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and gloves. Breathers (rather than face masks) are preferred when available.
The N95 respirators were approved for industrial facilities, but the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use License (EAA).
They are designed to protect from airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain in the case of uses for other non-specific purposes.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face masks, or homemade masks, as the last solution.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not degraded to the extent that they require artificial respiration or alternatives, but some cases require it.
The type of respiratory support provided to patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure in hospitals is actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided using a high-flow nasal canal or bi-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these options is of the same benefit to those suffering from a critical disease.
Some doctors prefer to continue using gaseous ventilation when available because this technique reduces the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal canals.Critical cases are more frequent among older people (aged over 60, especially those over 80).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for the population, limiting the ability of the health system to cope with the sudden rise in the number of serious COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed artificial respiratory support, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30 percent of those hospitalized because of COVID-19 are eventually admitted to intensive care units.
Artificial respiration becomes more complicated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in people with COVID-19 and the supply of oxygen becomes more difficult.
Respirators need to have pressure control modes and a high positive final exhalation pressure to maximize the delivery of oxygen while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and thoracic relaxation.
Elevated positive end-pressure exhalation may not be available in older respirators.
The search for potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial phase.
Remedicifer seems to be the most evangelical.
Although new drugs may take up to 2021 to develop, many of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are already at an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on people with a critical condition.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended volunteers to participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted a temporary license to use convalescence plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is seriously or directly threatened.
It has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove it is safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter the name and ID number.
The app is able to detect ‘contacts’ using surveillance data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials.Big data analytics of mobile data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected and mixed people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled the security services to track cell phone data of those it assumes to be infected with the coronavirus.
Action has been taken to impose quarantine and protect those who are likely to contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Galera told him that “40 percent of people are still moving everywhere.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon on a weekend involving more than 42,000 people.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has also made a global call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of injury itself.
Rory O’Connor said: “Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic stagnation is a major storm that is detrimental to people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may take a mild symptomatic or symptomatic course, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as a cold.
Simple cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more likely to develop severe COVID-19 based on data for other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of data for COVID-19.Covid-19 may affect the lungs in some people causing pneumonia.
In those most affected, COVID-19 may develop rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in respiratory failure, fetal trauma or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 are sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
6% of those with COVID-19 who were hospitalized were diagnosed with anomalies of blood clots, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, while 4% of those with renal impairment were observed.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have shown elevations in liver enzymes (aminotransmitters).
According to the same report, the average period between symptoms and death was 10 days, including five days in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death was seven days for those transferred to the intensive care unit.
In an early case study, the average period from the onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, totalling six to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent, while the mortality rate for women was 1.7 percent.
Histological anatomical examinations of post-mortem lung samples show widespread synchiatic damage with cellular fibromide secretions in both lungs.
Variations of viral cellular disease were observed in sung cells.
A lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage due to elevated troponine levels or cardiac arrest was observed in 11.8% of deaths announced by China's National Health Commission.
According to data released by the United States in March, 89% of those taken to hospital had previous cases.The availability of medical resources and the region’s socio-economic status could also affect deaths.
Mortality estimates resulting from the condition vary as a result of these differences between regions, but also due to methodological difficulties.
A decreased listing of minor cases may lead to an overestimation of the proportion of deaths over the truth.
However, the fact that previous cases caused deaths may indicate that the current mortality rate is lower than the reality.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and require intensive care and 2.4 times more likely to die than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority revealed a 20 to 30 percent reduction in lung capacity in some recovered patients, and lung tests indicated damage.
This can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after healing.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether or not a previous infection earns people recovering from the disease an effective and long-term immunity.
The acquisition of immunity is seen as potential, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have been reported cases that recovered from COVID-19 and subsequently contracted it again.
These conditions are thought to get worse if the infection persists more often than when it is repeated.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, given the spread of the infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely due to its human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that 1 December 2019 was the first date for symptoms.
Official publications from the World Health Organization reported that December 8, 2019 was the first date for symptoms to appear.
Numerous actions are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time taken since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) allocated the 10th International Classification of Diseases Emergency Code U 07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and the U 07.2 for diagnosed COVID-19 deaths.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the CFR mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those who were found to have died from an illness, and the IFR mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those who were infected (who were found and who were not).
These statistics do not have a time frame, and they track a specific population range from infection to knowing the fate of the condition.
Although antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all infected people, their presence may provide information about the number of infected people.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castellioni de Ada, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Janglet, the disease spread due to carnival festivals, moving to youth, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and perhaps not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified as a result.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exhausted.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, according to an evaluation of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed due to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting mortality rate vary between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The maximum risk for men is 50 years old, with the difference between men and women only fading at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of these gender differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immune differences, non-smoking prevalence among women and simultaneous conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to a higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The higher proportion of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a higher risk of HIV infection.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is COVID-19.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that Ko is an abbreviation for the word coronavirus, and in the abbreviation for virus WD is an abbreviation for disease and 19 refers to the year of the first outbreak detection: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species or group of people, in line with the international recommendations for the designation aimed at preventing stigma.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the WHO uses the expressions “Covid-19 virus” and “Covid-19 virus” in public statements.
The disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the coronavirus.
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the use of the two names for the novel coronavirus-2019 and the acute respiratory disease associated with the novel coronavirus-2019 as temporary names for the virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidelines banning the use of websites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies export health-care materials such as nose swabs and respiratory parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve and the supplier could not deliver on time, a local startup reversed its engineering and released the 100 required valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation emerged regarding the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the virus in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved medications or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers conduct international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the “Solidarity Experiment” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds that are most promisingly effective.
Vaccine is not available, but various bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies of SARS-CoV are used because it resembles SARS-CoV-2 in the use of ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being studied.
First, the researchers aim to create a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to trigger an immediate immune response in the human body against a new Covid-19 infection.
The second strategy, the micro-unit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain micro-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the Spike-S protein that helps the virus break into the ACE2 receptors.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (DNA vaccines or RNA vaccines, a new technique for innovating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies should be tested to ensure their safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent booster is referred to as a potential challenge facing the innovation of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.
Seven already approved treatment trials for malaria have been evaluated, including four studies related to hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The proposed reuse of antiviral drugs in the treatment of the new disease constitutes most of China’s research, through nine phase III trials on remedisiver across several countries, whose results are due to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and potential COVID-19 drugs was carried out as of April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including rimedesiver, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/itonavir combined with beta interferon.
There is preliminary evidence of the efficacy of rimedesiver, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with Remdesiver for euthanasia.
Phase III clinical trials are conducted in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, formerly used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer reviews for research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virus Research Institute suggests that despite the recommendation of a single gram dose, the weakening of this dose is very serious and could cause death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency license for use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of treating physicians for people with COVID-19.The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or omefenovir for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2.
Further study of the effect of nitazoxanide on organisms has been recommended after demonstrating inhibition of low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial configuration of the spike protein via transmembrane serin protein 2 (TMPRS2) is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant deficiencies that prevent the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study.Osiltamevir SARS-CoV-2 is not inhibited in the laboratory and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
A cytokine storm may be a complication in the later stages of acute COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine properties.The Chinese National Health Commission added to the guidelines for treatment after completing a small study.
It is undergoing a nationally non-random phase 2 test in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illnesses.
In addition to using ferritin in the blood serum to identify cytokine storms, it aims to counter such developments, which are believed to be the cause of death in some people.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has adopted an Interleukin-6 antireceptor, a receptor T-cell therapy of the chemare antigen, based on retrospective case studies to treat non-steroid-responder cytokine secretion syndrome that had a different cause in 2017.
To date, there is no controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine secretion syndrome.
The method of transporting the refined and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of recovering COVID-19 to those who need it is subject to study as a non-vaccinative method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and the results were inconclusive.
The neutralization of the virus represents the expected mechanism of action through which negative antibody therapy can act as a defense medium against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-based cellular toxicity, phagocytosis, or both may be used.
Other forms of negative antibody therapy, such as the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The production of serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies to the virus, can be increased for faster dissemination.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wen Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was later infected and died of COVID-19 after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
