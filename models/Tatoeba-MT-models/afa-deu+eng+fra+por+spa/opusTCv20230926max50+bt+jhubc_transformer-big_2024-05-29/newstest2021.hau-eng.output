Why did I leave the PDP.
Former chairman of the Federal Parliament, Yakubu Dogara, has explained some of the reasons why he left the PDP and moved to the APC.
Unless the former President of the Federal Parliament is forgotten, Yakubu Dogara has been involved with the PDP, relocating to the APC this week.
Doura said that he stood up to the plight of the PDP governor Bala in Bauchi State who helped the finalist win the 2019 election, and that he had gathered to leave the party and returned to the APC.
One of the main reasons why I opted out is the way the PDP governs Bauchi State.
Everyone knows the role I played in the election of the state governor of Abuja, former minister Bala Mohammed defeated the winning governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now I'm in a state of disarray.
Instead of staying in the PDP, I've been given the right to go to where I'm going, to go back to where I'm from.
Dogara wrote a letter of withdrawal from the PDP that he sent to the party leader of his constituency, Bogoro C, in Bauchi State.
Finally, he said, as he took to show other governors where they had failed and where to fix it in the past, he was not an unhealthy and unhealthy person.
I'm going to let them go
The fire broke out in a house in Kano.
The fire took off at about 10 a.m., which lasted about two hours, despite the arrests by the Kano State Fire Commission and security officials and the local community.
During Freedom Radio's visit to the site, she found a crowd of diverse security personnel in and around her, the location of which was connected to the main bus station known as the Kuka Station, which transports passengers from here in Kano to other states and even neighbouring countries.
In addition to the Waterfront market that emerged in Northern Nigeria.
Freedom Radio spoke with some witnesses and witnesses, who say the rise of the fire has resulted in a surviving population.
A driver's license at the Waterfront Station said they had cooperated with the police to rescue the passengers who were terrified by the fire.
The Kano State Fire Commission confirmed the incident, saying that as of the time we have compiled this report it is continuing to collect data to identify the causes and losses of the fire caused, as the spokesperson for the Sa'idu Muhammad Ibrahim said.
On the other hand, there have also been reports of irregularities that attempted to penetrate the Waterfront market for theft, but police and police officers have tried to evict them with the protection of community property.
In this regard, we contacted the spokesman of the Kano State Police Force DSP Abdullahi Harun Kiawa, who confirmed the incident.
PS: We have not yet completed the test of the quality of the medicine in Nigeria.
While European countries are continuing to carry out their combined coronavirus-related efficacy tests, Nigeria has also not been mentioned in the past in its combination and testing of drugs.
The National Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) said it was conducting the testing of the Corona-resistant drugs, up to 40 of which were submitted by the agency.
Mojisola Adeyeye, the head of the Mojisola Adeyeye, announced this on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola says the quality of the drug is being tested because it does not seek obesity in finding a hole.
Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, traditional medicines have been blocked by researchers in order to see that the disease has not been combined.
Many of them have submitted their medications to the authorities for testing and evaluating its quality.
The NAFDAC also provides them with some rules and regulations to follow in order to integrate the drug.
The quality of the drug will be tested in animals for the first time.
Mojisola has warned medical practitioners not to try any medication without the authority giving it the opportunity to do so.
In May, the NAFDAC said it was only in social media and newspapers that reports of claimants discovering a traditional cure for the coronavirus.
Adeyeye said it was only one person who had asked the NAFDAC to check the effectiveness of the drug, which he claimed was a traditional combination, saying it could cure the coronavirus.
He also said that he did not find a cure for the disease.
He said he had found a cure for the symptoms that were considered to be symptoms of the disease.
However, since then, some of the doctors have been involved in the
Ramaphosa faced questions in parliament.
It is the first time in a series of questions that President Ramaphosa has faced in parliament since corruption has been rampant among his top government officials and members of his party.
Ramaphosa has pledged to deepen its investigations and even bring about reforms in the area responsible for overseeing the part of the purchase of war-related products for the COVID-19 pandemic.
South Africa is ranked fifth on the global list of countries affected by the coronavirus pandemic, but the president said corruption played a key role in the fight against the virus in the country.
On Saturday, Nigeria will open international and international airports.
Authorities in Nigeria have said they will open airports for departure and entry into the country, from Saturday, for the first time after five months of closure.
Since March 23, the country's government has suspended the passage of flights, in response to the spread of the coronavirus.
The government has said that the first four planes to arrive from cross-border countries will begin landing in Abuja.
They will not know where they came from, and they will not know where they came from.
According to Hadi Sirika's Minister of Transportation, the opening step is to see that there has been no problem since the opening of the domestic shuttle on July 8.
Sirika added that it will be ensured that all the necessary rules are followed to ensure the return of the aircraft.
591 people have been recovered from COVID-19 in Nigeria.
On Friday, 591 new cases of COVID-19 were reported.
With this new number of people infected with COVID-19 in the country, the number of people infected has reached 39,539, of whom 16,559 have been cured and 845 have died.
The Nigerian Center for Disease Control, NCDC, has provided the number of individuals and states on its Twitter page.
There's more of us in our group - Marseille.
France's Marseille football team says three more players have been infected with the coronavirus after five deaths last week.
The report was made public in a press release released today.
The club also said that the French League 1 tournament, which was scheduled to begin on Friday, was postponed as a result of five players infected with COVID-19.
Marseille also said she had informed stakeholders in the preparation of the League 1, as a result of an increase in the number of infected people after the first five cases, in order to find a solution to the incident.
The APC has disbanded the Governor of Niger and attempted to bring Tarzoma to the party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement released this week by the APC, it accused Niger State Governor Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello of attempting to provoke riots within the party.
The document, signed by the President of the Engineering Party Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Barista Party Muhammad Liman, said that during the six years of the party's rule, only N512 million had been received.
The document went on to say that the meeting the governor called on stakeholders, which he led on Sunday night last weekend, will help to keep the party rallying, saying they wrote to the national party's secretary what was going on in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "We understand that the Governor of Niger State has tried to distribute the number of members of the party by organizing an illegally held party meeting, because any complaint against the party's leaders, in writing to the party's secretary, is illegal for investigation."
He added that in the six years since the founding of the party, N512 million were in the party's fund.
He said he understood as the governor to be on the national board of governors set up on July 25, 2020, which the president led in order to lead the planning of the problems between members of the party and the withdrawal of the court-appointed members of the party.
What is the amount of money we receive to pay the salaries of the party's secretaries, as well as other activities related to the party, the primary elections and the resolution of some of the problems of the party's citizens, such as the lack of access to government funding, not the cost of any party's unlawful killings.
As I explained, last year's local government primary elections were the most important expert election in the country that we have held with the former commissioners and commissioners who now hold the most powerful power in all the local governments of the state, bringing in twenty-five members of the municipality, whose funds will be spent.
Thus, it is a mistake for everyone who is illegally spending the party's money, this is almost unfair and trying to give a bad defense a little bit to hang him, and for a committee to set up a committee to investigate how to spend the party's money and to establish it.
Of the money that the defendant claims to be bankrupt, the money that the party's secretary of state has paid, and no other such funds, I challenge everyone on this issue who brought his witness to the proof of this accusation in any way.
The Imam, who stood up to defend the APC from attempting to dismantle the party, added that any accusation against the party or any party leader from the state level would be written by the committee in charge of the zone as part of the party's constitution, paragraph 82 (b) of section 21.
Therefore, the party's stakeholders have no role to play especially when they attempt to seize the power of the committee so their decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the best leaders of the party to be endorsed in the state, in paragraph 21 and paragraph 6 of page 87 of the party's constitution, anything that is common to this will not be used.
Because of the decision to fall in love with the owners of the holding, you made mistakes.
He said, those who presented with approval yesterday at an unpromoted meeting, which Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, were not members of the executive committee of the party in the state.
The executive committee of the party's stakeholders is chaired by the chairman of the Engineering Party, Mohammed Imam, and will not be led by the governor to lead the party's leaders.
The document added that the governor, Abubakar Sani Bello, recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promise made to the state's society during the elections, and of traveling with the party's parents in the government to benefit everyone in the state and all regions through the granting of political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The document commends the members of the Federal Parliament who refused to attend the meeting and draw attention to the settlement of all problems between members of the party, which is not surprising for the members of the legislature who know their own illness, and for their refusal to approve false arrest as a party law.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the National Retention Committee to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the appropriate position not to attempt to consolidate the state's politics.
Nigeria's economy is on the brink of the Internet - Freedom Radio Nigeria
Dr. Isa Ali, Minister of Communications and Economic Development of the Internet, said the country is ready for the revolution in the digital economy.
He also said that the government is ready to work with the shoulders and shoulders of experts from universities and other stakeholders to see the country being captured in every state of modern technology.
Dr. Isa Ali Fantami explained this during a national and international conference on the development of communication technology held by the Internet.
The minister also added that one of the first steps taken by the government in view of the country's adoption of telecommunications technology was to change the name of the ministry from the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Communications and the Development of the Internet Economy.
How chemicals prevent food damage affect the health of people in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned people to avoid eating foods that are used to prevent food damage, that eating such foods is harmful to human health.
The report is based on a review of the quality of food in the country.
The results of the study show that some foods are being poured into the chemicals to prevent them from getting infected.
The research also shows that this chemical is most commonly used in wake, town hallmarks and buseshhen fish that are provided to the public.
It is used because if a person sees it, he will be interested in using it.
Eating foods containing this chemical causes cancer, kidney disease, heart attack and so on.
The people of this country are called upon to focus on protecting the use of these types of foods for their health.
Unforgettable, a food quality expert Grace Olasumbo has called on Nigerians to avoid consuming molten wood and Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo explained that the Sindarin Calcium Carbide is the chemical most commonly used by marketers in grinding raw materials, i.e. raw materials.
Research has shown that patience and tolerance are among the factors that make marketers use this substance because in one day it reflects the vegetables.
Olasumbo explained that one thing that marketers have failed to recognize is the use of this substance to showcase the nutrients that I've done to people's health in particular.
The reason for this is for your illnesses including migraines, eye pain, abdominal discomfort, sore throat, mouth, stomach, and so on.
The head of the African Development Bank has been cleared of charges - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The committee of experts led by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson washes the head of the African Development Bank AfDB Akinwumi Adesina.
According to Akinwumi Adesina's committee, he is not guilty of any wrongdoing.
The AFP news agency reported that at the beginning of this year it was a fifteen-page report that accused Mr. Adesina, sixty-year-old, of allegedly showing superiority and lack of leadership and self-sufficiency.
However, the committee of experts led by Robinson, along with Gambia's chief justice Hassan Jallow, and the deputy governor of the World Bank, who is responsible for the workforce, Leonard McCarthy, have cleared the former Nigerian agriculture minister of all charges against him.
In the past, the U.S. has insisted that Adesina be investigated on the allegations, following a washdown by the AfDB, which prompted the establishment of a panel of experts to conduct the investigation.
COVID-19 has stopped the Trump election campaign in Florida.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he had cancelled a Republican conference to be held in Jacksonville, Florida, next month as a result of the rise in coronavirus infections.
The conference will be held in North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that it was not appropriate to hold a conference at the time.
President Trump relocated part of the GOP summit to Florida last month after they found a disagreement with North Carolina's Democratic leaders over the holding of the meeting in a closed meeting room with his supporters without causing face-to-face restrictions.
A few Republican representatives will be sitting in Charlotte, North Carolina, to officially elect Trump on Aug. 24.
Trump said he would make a statement in a different way.
Trump, who has spent months on the epidemic's impact, has also recently said 99 per cent of the number of infected people seen in the U.S. would not be affected.
Buhari will not accept the blessings of God.
It is the night of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the night of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that he will be with you.
He also said that he would not be able to speak to the people of the day, but that he would not be able to speak to the people of the day.
Shehu said the measure was taken as a result of recommendations from the Islamic Supreme Council to curb the coronavirus pandemic.
President Muhammadu Buhari also stressed the measures recommended by the House of Representatives to avoid gatherings of many people in the same place.
At a small prayer ceremony that was held that year, the president prayed for His Blood at home with his family instead of going to the mosque as he used to do every year.

China has achieved the achievements of the public's supply of food - Leadership Newspapers Hausa
Food is the spirit of all living beings, and life can only be compulsory with food.
This is the reason why China's governments are increasing in terms of ensuring the nation's food supply.
In the last 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China has made major gains in food supply, which has given the world a surprise view of the country's population, which is estimated to have exceeded 1.4 billion.
This effort has been instrumental in making China's greatest contribution to eradicating hunger in the world, as Zhang Wufeng, the head of the Chinese Agricultural and Cereal Conservation Commission, has previously stated that, since 1949, China has always placed the issue of hunger in the forefront of all travel.
But in recent days, some people and other media outlets from around the world have been "reasoning" the question of whether China can raise its own nation in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.
We are grateful to all of you for your continued support in this world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has achieved enough food production based on the man's efforts.
The issue of supplying enough food to China is one of the main agendas of the JKS ruling party.
Last weekend, the secretary-general of the JKS Supreme Council, who is president of China, Xi Jinping, issued an important order to stop barnata food, indicating that, everyone knows that every single batch of hard work is available.
Although this year's globally alarming respiratory impact of COVID-19 is also damaging to China's economy, China could provide enough food for its people.
China's statistical agency estimates on the number of agricultural products, especially rice, that the country will receive in 2020, show that the number of rice obtained in the country in the first half of 2020 reached 27.29 million tonnes, rising by 1.08 million tonnes, up 3.9% compared to the equivalent of 2019.
He also said Ke Bingsheng, a former head of China's Agricultural University, has made major gains in the face of the country's food and prosperity compared to the beginning of the implementation of the policy of domestic transformation and the opening of the door to the warehouse.
Huang Jikun, director of the Peking University's China Agricultural Policy Study Center, said while meeting the representative of The China Science Daily, that China's severe challenge is now facing in the next two or three years, whether China could reduce the number of imports.
Now the total number of pounds each received is 474 kilograms instead of 400 kilograms each person should have received annually.
China has now imported millions of tons of agricultural products for the purpose of nurturing domestic animals.
Therefore, those who are concerned about the matter should calm their minds, bathe and go to sleep, or turn their minds on the affairs of their home.
The Chinese are able to raise themselves with the food they produce.
The reason why I sued Ganduje in court - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Kano governor's candidate Abba Kabir Yusuf has explained why he prosecuted Kano governor Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and other businessmen before the state's Supreme Court.
Abba Kabir explained this by his lawyer, Bashir Tudun zawirci, who said he had filed a lawsuit, alleging that the owners of certain government buildings benefited by the Kano State community.
In addition to the governor of Kano and the marketers, Abba Kabir Yusuf also appealed to the Ministry of State Works and Housing and Transportation at the Atoni General and the Kano Judicial Commissioner and the State Land Management Commission.
Abu Kabir Yusuf accused the Kano State government and the owners of some of the former Daula hotel that is now under the supervision of the University of Science and Technology of Wudil and Shahuci Station, saying that this was in line with the provisions of the laws of the country.
It is only necessary to have a plan and a plan for adoption in 2023.
Mother's son and senior friend of President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura, has said that Nigeria's pacifist style is now the oldest.
Mamma Daura said Nigeria has already taken the plunge and has now abandoned the reception system to focus on selecting the most eligible by 2023.
The BBC has published an interview with Daura's mother.
This process of acceptance of the Nigerian presidential election did not create an eye-catching son that began in 1999.
Instead, Daura said that focus should be on determining who deserves it until this process of acceptance was followed.
However, the Igbo clan, the Igmarians, also responded to Daura's remarks.
He and his nephew, President Buhari, have been accustomed to romon rule by accepting a letter of approval, and he will now come out and recommend not to do so by 2023.
Buharin himself is not the most elected Nigerian.
In the same way, the country's top security officers, who have been in their seats for many years, have not been removed, and they are not able to do more than others.
The Martyrs.
A political hurricane for the Nigerian presidency on Wednesday, while the Igbo-Zalla Tribal Muradina Protection Group, Ndigbo, harassed Mamman Daura, over the speech of the Nigerian presidency's co-chairmanship to the Inayamai tribe.
In a meeting with Daura, who is the nephew of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said that a zone-based system would be in place in the presidential election in 2023.
As a result, he hasn't been able to read the so-called social media, and Ndigbo has quickly released a statement to his mother, Daura, calling him a tyrant.
In a statement issued by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the South East Igbo Zlala tribal group, and in the Southeast Shi'ite are also allowed to run for president in the 2023 election, the Igbo Tribe.
The Speaker of the Igbo Tribal Federation, Emeka Attamah, has said that the words of Mamman Daura as Nigeria's presidency college in 2023 are for the Igbo tribe.
Why hasn't she been able to talk to her mom since 2019?
They have allegedly expelled Jonathan, and now Daura has served for the Southern District College which will preside over Nigeria in the 2023 elections.
It's just that when he's finished collecting what he's picked up from his brother's current president, he's going to come up with an issue that we don't know about in 2023.
As an elder, he must embrace the truth and hold it firmly.
It's not how he came up with the leadership of the presidency in 2023, the leadership and I'm self-centered.
VOA's Discussion on Victimization
The issue of abuse of women and young children by rape has become commonplace in northern Nigeria, where reports show how children are being deprived of their rights.
People from various parts of the world attended the session on July 23 to discuss how the situation is worsening in the country and how to deal with it.
The participants in the sessions relate to the problem with things such as advertising for children and the involvement of other parents.
One of the mothers attending Hajiya Fathi'a Shaibu, the mother of the former governor of Plateau and Niger during the reign of the late Sani Abacha, described poverty as one of the factors that make parents of dora publicity for their children.
And Maryam (Maryam) said to her, “We are the sons of the Most High; we are the sons of the Most High; we are the sons of the Most High; we are the sons of the Most High; we are the sons of the Most High; we are the sons of the Most High; we are the daughters of the Most High; we are the sons of the Most High.”
We also call on teachers to begin preaching with a loud voice to parents and siblings who are abusing their children themselves.
He, a member of the federal parliament representing Mayiama Constituency, Koko and Besse of Kebbi State Honrable Shehu Mohammad, expressed frustration and support for the enactment of a strict law that would punish anyone arrested for rape in the country.
At the end of Hajiji Mdina, David and Nasiru El-hikaya, who led the conference hall, thanked those who attended the meeting on behalf of the VOA who responded to their invitation.
The "Media Writers" in the North.
Modern social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Paganism and others, have long been playing a role in providing spaces for dialogue, cooperation and friendship between different communities around the world, with the delivery of messages, stories, and the dissemination of political policies, business education and communication.
Young people in Nigeria have entered into this new technology using social media spaces, to travel with modernity, donating or putting their blessings in the windows that have affected their lives.
We can say, these opportunities have brought us much progress that Northern youth are benefiting from in the region's business, economic, education and politics.
Many people eat food by writing and delivering messages on the web, getting jobs to do, or improving the services they manage.
It's sad to see that some young people instead of using this opportunity to enjoy the progress achieved, there are others who follow the stereotypes of southern children who have left the country in the process of offending the public, inside and outside the country, or writing about the abuse and abuse of judges and their predecessors.
This is an indication of the progress of the youth in the country.
The arrival of the Northern Media Writers in the country is a major benefit, to provide the youth of the Northern Hang, a good guide and cleanliness of the activities of the youth in the Soshial Midaya, as they will become written authors of meanings and propagate the policies of the Northern community.
It is incumbent upon us to give this organization the unity it needs, in order to achieve its philanthropy, which will bring sacrifices not only to our northern region, but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I advise our youth, especially our social media users, to come together to protect the North's integrity and freedom, and to provide a system that will be transformative for everyone.
As did our Northern leaders who slept on several occasions, such as the Sardaon of Sokoto, the first Northern Prime Minister Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his close associates, they aspired to provide for the Northern community.
It is rumored that, the late warrior of violence and poverty, Master Aminu Kano, once said, Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
Therefore, as we call for national development and the promotion of governance, at every step, we are calling for the unity of the Northerners, without prejudice to religion or ethnicity, to bring our progress to the region.
When we look at the North, it's no different.
Therefore, we should use God's wisdom to make contributions and suggestions, in order to provide the North with a satisfactory way of recovering its economy.
The North should provide revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to lose money.
In addition, as long as we want the advancement of the North, we have made an important contribution to education, agriculture, tourism, health care and science and technology.
If we don't have money, there are different ways to do it.
That's what we see in the North!
We're proud of the North.
The government has allocated N126 billion to rehabilitate the country's hospitals.
The federal government has allocated N126 billion of the country's economic improvement plans to rehabilitate hospitals in the country.
The hospitals to be rehabilitated include the FMC hospital, places for clinical trials, the Department of Emergency Care, the Department of Surveillance for Patients with Disabilities, and teaching hospitals in 36 states in the country.
Recently, a number of health care providers have called on government departments to work together to raise enough funds to improve the country's health care system.
The experts made this call at a conference to get clean on providing quality health care for people easily and done in Abuja.
In a speech, the Senatorial candidate representing Kwara North under the auspices of the APC, Sadiq Umar, said the Nigerian government should take matters of vital importance to improve the country's health.
What is the reason for this failure to do so is that the industry suffers from a lack of funding, which is why it depends on the amount of support it receives from abroad.
In spite of this, Omar said that the government had no role to play in the health care sector, which led to the withdrawal of the support they were providing.

People who are going to die of starvation in Africa will be killed by the Coronavirus.
According to the International Agricultural Development Institute (IFAD), there will be at least 23 million more people dying of hunger in the sub-Saharan Africa region in 2020.
IFAD President Gilbert Houngbo expressed this at the World Economic Forum's Economic Forum.
Children's conferences discussed the problem of food systems in Africa during the Coronavirus pandemic.
Houngbo said the study, which looked at how the food crisis was being tackled, showed that by 2020, those who would be killed by hunger in Africa would be outnumber those killed by the coronavirus, not too far away.
IFAD is a well-known center for supporting people living in rural areas to develop agriculture, increase the production of nutritious food for their children and provide them with income through agriculture.
Houngbo said the coronavirus has shown that there is a problem with the system of food production, distribution and repair.
Many farmers have struggled with how they can't find modern fertilizers because of the traffic control law.
And they were not able to go to the farm and those who farmed the fruit of the farm for sale, the markets were closed and promised to keep selling the fruit of the garden.
The report adds that in 2019 famine killed 135 million people worldwide, 73 million of whom came from Africa, in 36 countries.
The famine in northern Nigeria killed 5 million people in 2019.

The Nigerian Oil Company (NNPC) said that the total revenue earned from the export of petroleum in June amounted to <0x24>378.42 million, earning <0x24>133.16 million in May this year.
The Nigerian oil company added that this is the increase in tax revenues since the global coronavirus outbreak, which has led to the introduction of a ban on traffic and a drop in oil prices on the global market.
In a letter signed by the company's chief public relations officer, Dr Kennie Obateru, NNPC stated that, in the NNPC month, it added that it had received large amounts of money from the oil and gas carriers amounting to <0x24>4.60 billion between June 2019 and June 2020.
Similarly, the company disclosed that it received a total of <0x24>378.42 million from a petroleum producer who exported to foreign countries in June 2020, where it received <0x24>133.16 million in May 2020.
As the company stated earlier, <0x24>230.65 million was earned from the mining oil, while <0x24>75.97 million was earned from <0x24>71.80 million in wholesale.
The company's reported revenue in June 2020 is the 59th report the company publishes per month.

It's not the worst crime in Nigeria, it's the worst crime in Nigeria.
A classmate in Kaduna State, Alhaji Aliyu Maiidaje, pointed out that the death sentence for the suspected rape in the country, especially in northern Nigeria, is the only solution.
Alhaji Aliyu Maiidaje announced this in an interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, adding that, after an investigation, the death sentence was the only solution.
He added that the decision would reduce the number of rape cases that can be easily obtained, but the main easiest is to correct our hearts.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "We are the ones who have been sent by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and who have been sent by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
What a shame it would be to say that a full-fledged male or older man has found a young girl, three or five years old, who raped her.
He went on to say that, in the midst of God's wrath, we will not be in the ranks of the rulers, or of the kings of the earth, where he pointed out that there is no way to make progress if such a calamity is achieved.
He added that because we are in a state of distress and pain, the country has been unable to continue, the rulers, the governors and the president have lost their way of dealing with the matter.
He added that until they ate that blessing and then a month's break, it was necessary to correct our hearts so that God would bring us the solution to the issue of rape.
He knew that whatever they were doing, they would have to do everything for the sake of God, because he was the one who eliminated all suffering and poverty for the people.
God knows what He wants you to do, and He knows what He wants you to do, and He knows what He wants you to do, and He knows what He wants you to do.
He pointed out that the police in the state can also do their best to send the suspects to the Court of Appeals for their own attempts to deal with this potentially catastrophic incident, both in our North Nigerian region and in the country.
He called on special parents to keep a close eye on their children, citing an example of how the parents do it to raise the issue.
He said that some parents do not follow the life of their children, whether they go to school or not, whether they return home on time or not, adding that on the other hand, there is some fault for some parents because they should know that it is God who gives them the children and tomorrow they will be asked what kind of training they are doing.

A farmer's guide to the development of a farmer's home in the country - The New York Times
Rice farmers in Biniwe State expect to make a large harvest as two months after planting.
Some of them who were detained in Makurdi expressed the hope that the harvest would be at any time between October and November.
A small farmer in Mbatiab-Gboko, Titus Atondo, said it planted rice in a two-hectare area in July.
Atondo says he has acquired varieties from the market in his area and are in the two CP groups and rice OC while using Dazzle chemicals to clear the soil for planting and soil.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenges of rice farming in the countryside such as the Maina are numerous because we rely heavily on labor as customers are unable to find agricultural routes.
Titus Atondo added that, we are taking people to farm from the national level to the harvest, adding that, this is tired and has a lot to do.
Atondo said all the money spent on his farm that is now including planting, clearing, modern planting applications and expected to reach N220,000.
Titus Atondo continued that, however, he expected at least 50 bags of eggs as a harvest of two hectares and would probably be sold at a price of N29,000 per 100k bag.
He also planted a large rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, in June to July on 274 acres of the farm whose price stood at N14,500 per hectare while the national field was paying N25,000 per hectare.
He planted 44 varieties (Supi) and 61 varieties (OC) derived from the National Agricultural Development Council (print) and some originated from the company Olam Nigeria.
He added that, at this time, growth levels are in different fields while others are in the grazing program, others are also in the initial stage of killing animals as farmed in stages.
Tarnongu added that the challenges so far include money since the production price of the selected animals is expensive and the wage price has increased.
He said the harvest is expected to begin in October.
He added that the total price of raw materials at the end of the day would be the lowest of N246,000 per hectare as production is expected to produce three tons of honey which could translate to N360,000 at a cost of N120 per kilogram.
Tarnungu does not use pharmaceuticals on its rice farm, instead, it advises and implements traditional agricultural work, adding that, therefore, we use highly insect-killer plants, insect-killers and pharmaceutical soil.
The head of the National Farmers' Association (AFAN) Benue State branch, Comandante Aondongu Saaku, also expressed the hope that this year's rainfall would be suitable for large rice farming.
According to the President of the National Farmers' Association (AFAN) rehen of Benue State, Kommarade Aondongu Saaku, more farmers entered the rice farming business at the end of this year due to the Corona virus that prevented many from leaving offices while staying in their farms.
He said that in 2019, more than one million tons of crops will be harvested by the farmers.
According to him, the data collectors are currently collecting statistics from different types of farmers and when the work is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be assessed.
The head of the National Farmers' Association (AFAN) Benue State branch, Komrade Aondongu Saaku who said, he planted three acres of rice farming, noted that some farmers planted rice in June while those who farm short-term do so at the same time as the expected harvest in late December or early November.
The head of AFAN added that rice farmers are using maize to kill aging vegetables, chemical crops, and pesticides.
He expressed concern about the challenges of animals threatening rice farming, adding that farmers are making fences, placing cords with the clearing of the farms' edges to address the problem.
Covid 19: Two-and-a-half million face-to-face penalties have been distributed in Kano.
The government of Kano State in the northwestern part of Nigeria has distributed facial and nose protection restrictions of up to two and a half million people.
President Abdullahi Umar Ganduje led the launch of the share of the goods at a conference held at the State Government House.
Governor Ganduje said the use of sanctions across the state as a whole is necessary, following the state's success in fighting the spread of Covid-19, also known as the Coronavirus.
According to him, the state's governorates were placed in this facility, where the governors, the governors and the neighbourhoods act according to the principle and mechanism to ensure the slowing down of its spread.
In addition, the government has imposed restrictions on the distribution of labor unions in the state.
On his part, Kano King Aminu Ado Bayero thanked God for the relief of the spread of Covid-19 in Kano State.
He also urged al-Mumah to continue to support the government in ending the disease and praying for those who lost their lives.
Where he advised the public to hold prayers in the care of self-preservation from COVID-19 infections.
The principles of self-defense and health care must be adhered to, especially in the places of prayer for the holidays.
"Everything that I don't have to stop is a time of celebration," King Kano said.
Speaking since the beginning of his speech, Dr. Aminu Ibrahim Tsanawa, the state health commissioner, commended the state government for the protection measures it continues to take to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
In addition, there is a decrease in the number of people infected with the virus, and various parts of government and non-governmental organizations are commending the government's efforts to fight Covid-19.
Speaking during this meeting, the State Environment Commissioner, Dr Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, said that, in addition to the efforts of public and private ministries and markets, they have now distributed more than the trip to protect the nose and mouths of nearly 1,000 people.
Some of the groups that benefited from this scheme of a share of face and nose protection restrictions totalling two million and half included three TOAKAN founding bike groups, the NURTW, NARTO, RTEAN, other automotive vendors' groups, the Council of Ministers and staff members.
The meeting, which took place in Budapest at the Kano State Government Palace, was attended by senior stakeholders on health, traditional kingdoms, and a number of thousands of workers' organizations.
The meeting was held at the National Security Workshop of the Republic of Niger.
The issue of respect for women's rights and national laws, which aim to give them full access to the laws governing the elections in order to play a major role in the governance laws of one of the key issues discussed by the CNDP conference, has been discussed by MRN spokesperson Dr. Idrissa.
Even the so-called liberal parties agree with this process of engaging women in politics, starting with the issue of non-election tickets within the political parties, as the head of these parties, Mr Hambali Dodo, the head of state, said in a statement.
A review of the system under which elections are held in Niger is one of the needs that the participants of this meeting have come to because they say that it is a way to enable the distractions.
However, this is not necessary because, according to the law, the election of any bill at the time of the commencement of the contest is against the law.
Opponents who continue to obstruct all other electoral protection restrictions did not attend this meeting, which is linked to the lack of legitimacy that they said had encompassed the CENI Electoral Commission.
On December 13, 2020, local government elections are expected to be held while the first round of presidential and parliamentary elections will be held after just two weeks of 27 months.

The story of the murder of a student named Abraham Khaleel.

Zailani added: "It's true that you don't want to be told, when you go to other places of worship, you hear their guides speak to them and then they promote the hatred of their non-religious friends.
This is the cause of conflict among people.
Finally, he said that the religious leaders must be reunited and then teach the followers of the message of God the Most High, as it has been found in our religious books, that there will be no peace.
Similarly, the senator representing Kaduna Central, Father Known, who attended this meeting, asked the residents of Kaduna not to have a word before speaking it.
This conflict has been going on for over 40 years.

A full-length film by Beyoncé titled "Black Is King," the Indigenous Persons of King continues to be praised and celebrated in the world, as it describes African culture.
In South Africa, where the 85-minute film was featured, many people said it was too much for the film.
Black is King, is a music-film featuring American singer and songwriter, directed by Beyoncé's design, animation and finish.

Some say Beyonce, born in Houston, Texas, has illegally left African objects, especially their African-friendly features in the film, while traditionally having no roots in the African continent.
But in South Africa, those who have played a role in this film are also happy to do it.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a film-reading student, said he was honored to be one of the filmmakers.
He said he was impressed by the film.
The film covers a number of things that are not taught to students in school about the history of black people.
He said that when he saw the film he also first saw the story and the clothes she wore and took on the film's material, which developed a lot more than he thought it would happen.
Beyoncé's lover Kgosi Motosoane said Africans in foreign countries - including the U.S. Navy - have access to what some see as African cultural objects.
Who's interested in the film?
Kgosi said that women are more likely to be relegated to the national level in society.
As a result, their development in such highly influential matters is a stimulating factor.
As a reader of filmmaking, Mathebula's Beyoncé film made him interested in making the film first in order to spread more information about Africa.
Beyoncé's fans sing about one thing: If the man's body is a king, then Beyoncé is a queen.

The Federal Ministry of Agriculture, responsible for the Bird and Bird Remedies Department, Yawa Makkari Kagara, said it had not been more than a month since the completion of the bird-killing treatment in the Sokoto region.
He added that the birds were imported from the Niger Republic and Benin, and land and land relations had to be agreed before the problem could be resolved.
In June, the federal government launched a bird-killing operation in 12 northern Nigerian states that are neighbouring and foreign-borne to Nigeria.
However, the problem can be reversed to the growth seen in the agricultural sector, which governments claim is giving him special attention.

People need to know the legal code of 2019 - KCSF.
Kano State's Kano Civil Society Forum (KCSF), jointly with the European Union, the British Council, and the United Kingdom's Association for the Advocacy of Law and Anti-Rule 2019 (Rule of Law and Anti-Rupture).

Some participants at the event, which is the third such event organized, in the three Kano Senatorial Areas, from civil society groups have explained how they viewed the system of laws and their message.
Our representative, Aminu Halilu Tudunwada, who attended the phone conference on the subject, shocked us that the problems of some conservative laws faced by society were discussed.

SERAP, a group of activists for the protection of human rights and the development of the international economy called SERAP, called for President Muhammadu Buhari to suspend the Nigerian Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami and the Chief Executive Officer of the Properties Registration Commission.
According to the SERAP, this step is a violation of human rights as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution.
Before the human rights groups complained about this step of government, the various religious leaders also complained to the Buhari government that this law was re-established for review and approval by parliamentarians, in such a way that it would not violate the constitutional right to freedom of religion.
Pastor John Buro, head of Christianity in Kaduna State, told the Voice of the United States that the law was not based on ammunition, especially if the government was seeking a ban on worship or sanctions.
It should only be used by means of monitoring and monitoring all violators of the law without introducing a new law.
For his part, Dr Bashir Yanuzo, a professor of science at Minna, said that although there was no blame for the government's monitoring of companies and organizations for national security, this does not mean that a firm will allow the freedoms of others to be limited.
Now it's time for the government to listen to the public.
How the Akure University of Technology (FUTA) tried to duplicate the PREMIUM TIMES website on the internet.
The Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has taken on an advocacy role for web-site-sharing, to push back on the PREMIUM TIMES website, the leading "online" newspaper in Nigeria.
This web-site hacking has done all the tricks that hackers on people's websites are pursuing to access their websites, but it hasn't succeeded.
He began attempting to "hack" his weaponry at the university campus on February 28, and carried out his attacks using the "data" of the university.
On the one hand, when he tries to hack the PREMIUM TIME's web-site and computer, he attacks again with his GSM phone.
Five days ago, the cure opened the door to the entrance to the main site of the Premium Times, but it failed, despite the fact that it used various state-of-the-art weaponry.
He failed to break through, because the university was unaware that PREMIUM TIMES newspaper had a copy of its own program, which she built with a wall and a wall of a door that was not enough to break down.
Also, PREMIUM has its own security officers of the modern-day Maintenance Website, including the King of the Battle of PREMIUM TIMES and the Chief Protector, the PremiUM TIMES Site Protector.
These security officers have the modern experience in demolishing any multi-group or barden that seeks to be self-reported, or to certify the attempts to fight in the PREMIUM TIMES Data Components.
Here's a list of the most popular websites that you can find on the website:
At 8 o'clock in the morning, the door to the main room of the Premium TIMES began to bleed, to see how it would break the stove-stroke into it, and tossed the cabin completely.
Failing to succeed in the night, the next morning and at 6:15 a.m., he re-tested the hour, this time using the "WPScan", which is being done to detect the strong or inefficient security measures of major Internet sites such as PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he began to squeeze into the power of modern computer technology, the "custom script".
In the morning, he did everything he could to get his hands on the computer to make sure that the site was completely closed.
How a Farmer Responds to the Problem
This loophole did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had dealt with the treatment of small rats and large beets entering their modern networking sites to cover the loophole or snatch the sukutum site.
This lack of knowledge makes all of the raw materials he used, as a whole old similarities that could not do any damage or damage to PREMIUM TIMES.
On that day he suffered in vain fatigue because he was followed by an attack on the DDOS in the Likau Village NTP, which is the oldest method used since Kano of the village.
It was March 3rd that he made every stunt he had in mind and thought, but none of it was successful.
This attempt to break the doors of the Prime Minister's Office comes just days after PREMIUM TIMES published the story of a conflict between President Muhammadu Buhari's adviser at the Security Fanin, Babagana Monguno and his former Chief of Staff, Abbas the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff.
Some within the Federal University of Technology in Akure, congratulated PREMIUM TIMES that the university had taken over some of the major rats on the Internet, in order to deal with the main PREMIUM TIME program, to destroy or dismantle it.
However, when the Prime Minister contacted the FUTA University, he was far from aware of this attempt to fight the main Prime Minister of the Internet.
He said that unless a student who is only a minor at the university tries to do so alone, he will not be able to do so.

This agency has released a schedule of plans for the upcoming Edo and Ondo Elections, starting on February 6, 2020.
We've given a space of about seven to eight months for the two selections to be well-prepared.
Today I am delighted that we have implemented 10 of the 14 plans that INEC has planned for implementation.
No one has been arrested until she has been released from the date of execution.
The final step is to secure the registration of the number of voters who will vote for the 14 parties that will contest the Yakubu Machine.

As Beijing's government has warned, Washington's government is not rushing to retreat.
Thirty-five years ago, the United States opened an office in Chengdu, which has about two hundred employees.

The meeting also called on the authorities to expedite the planning of the return of all the emigrants of the kingdom to their homes.
The meeting also recommended the establishment of a committee for the promotion of peace that will include the tribes, Hausa, Fulani and Atyap and their youths to organize major meetings and discussions on security issues from time to time for peace in their kingdom.

Governor Abdullahi Ganduje wants the Kano State House of Assembly to amend the Kano State Act of 2019, as it will confirm the nominations of two of the most senior Kano emirates of the Kingdom by late King Ado Bayero and King Sanusi, as the state law will confirm their appointments as chief appointees of the King in Kano.

17 years of trial until the Supreme Court has ruled that he has been abducted.
He also wanted Ganduje to regain his throne, and the amendment of the law was among the king's appointees in the kingdom of Kano.
Ade Bayero was removed from the club in 2003 after being found guilty of conspiracy and rape in a political incident.
The committee was set up to investigate him, but he was invited to refuse to go to the committee to protect him.
He then challenged his removal at the Kano State High Court up to the Supreme Court.
Before the Supreme Court, the Federal Court of Appeals decided to restore the Grand Amit to his seat.
But the Kingdom of Kano under Muhammadu Sanunmsi II, was elevated, with the Supreme Court emphasizing the removal of him as the Sage of the East, and the King of the Dead, on 5 June.

NAPTIP has kidnapped traffickers and rescued 71 people in Kano State.
The National Anti-Violence and Trafficking Agency (NAPTIP) of Kano State has arrested three migrants and rescued 71 people from their hands in the state.
Kano Shehu Umar, Kano State Police Commander, said he was meeting with the Nigerian News Agency on Friday.
He said the agency had sent traffickers to Mikiya after receiving confidential information on human trafficking activities in the state.
It was for this reason that the agency hunted these people from July 15 to 19 where they were successfully arrested.
Of the three individuals arrested, two are Cameroon nationals and one is Nigerian and all ages are not over 21 to 36.
These people were captured while on their way to Algeria, Morocco and Libya.
18 out of 71 people to be transported from Cameroon where there are 14 men, 4 women.

The struggle and commitment that I have sought for you, is something that is in my heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Longyuan village of the Hongsipu region of Wuzhong city in Ningxia State is ruled by the autonomous Hui tribe, in the northwestern region of China.
There is a woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (i.e. her Islamic name) who is famous for her struggles in life and her successes based on her efforts to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that effort and dedication to self-sacrifice is a matter of heart.
Initially Li Yaomei or Sadiya, she had never been in class with the intention of taking a lesson, a case that made her unable to read text.
But God gave her the gift of wisdom, discernment, and great wisdom, so that she became an example in the field of war and poverty.
About 20 years ago, Mrs. Li Yaomei suffered from abdominal pain, which led to surgery three times.
After her recovery, she suffered a terrible accident, and now she is walking with the iron placed on her feet.
These challenges she faced were thrown into the backdrop of a health crisis, even the issue of medicine, and the reason for her taking the lifespan of about 3 thousand yuan, equivalent to over N16 million.
Surprisingly, this challenge faced by Teacher Sadiya turned her into a way of sacrificing and humiliating her in order to see her improve her life.
Then, with the support of the Chinese government, he increased his courage.
Its function is to create a variety of varieties based on the use of vegetation.
Due to her husband's efforts, her daughter's profession has grown so much, that she is given a tiny order by various employees.
In addition, she created a number of engines that help her to make the job easier.
For example, it took 15 minutes to connect a single large shaft, but now in that time, it will combine up to 5 shafts.
In addition, it has produced additional engines that clean up the intestines and restore the capacitors.
There's also an additional machine that cleans women's pet food, and these machines are still being sold to the applicants.
In view of the challenges faced by Teacher Sadia, and the efforts she is still making to improve her life and that of her employees, it will be understood that the applicant must be with me.
The fight against poverty and the improvement of life is not something that has hung up on the government.
If the government is to provide support, but people are not reluctant or eager to improve their lives by seeking jobs to do according to their state of mind, then only a short period of time will be continued without achieving any goal.
Her story shows that conducting a profession or earnings work does not require any money bulls or trips to other cities or overseas.
Because she considers the situation, she uses the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
Additionally, the Sadia teacher carried out these activities on her feet without relying on her husband, because he had to run away from her.
In other words, it's the effort and dedication that I have in mind.
Then he showed the strength of women to change their lives and stand on their feet without seeking the help of someone else.
This is also a lesson that, whatever a person is going to do, he should stand by his feet, because he is unsure of who he is.
Teacher Sadiya was indeed an astute, intelligent and ethical man who became an example and a lesson to the rest of the people.
As of March of the Children, Teacher Sadia has completed the payment of all the outstanding debts, and has also suspended the government's subsidy on the basis of self-indulgence.

There are fears that the U.S. will destroy the efforts to curb COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed concern over the measures taken by other countries, preserving the expected COVID-19 breathing vaccine, stating that vaccines should be prevented from being applied to the community.
And the vaccine should be distributed in a manner that is appropriate across the globe, so it would be suitable for the great popularity of different countries.
Indeed, some U.S. politicians are implementing the policy of showing preference over their own welfare, about distributing vaccines, and also undermining the interdependence between the country and the country in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has already exceeded 23 million.
In addition, there are more than 800,000 people who have lost their lives as a result of the disease.
Under such a severe situation, the impact of vaccines is increasingly focused, and the joy is that, in recent days, there have been significant results in the study of vaccines in some countries, a case that has created hope, and the belief in the global community as a whole.
But unfortunately, some American politicians have expressed a desire to be vaccinated.
The journal Science also stated that the U.S. government has already ratified agreements to buy more than <0x24>6 billion worth of COVID-19 vaccines from a variety of pharmaceutical companies.
Although the U.S. government's policy is understood, the presence of the U.S. is at the forefront of the spread of the disease, but other developing countries are also in need of vaccines, considering that they are more likely to suffer from a lack of health resources.
The magazine "The Ecologist" also indicated that, if the U.S. achieves the target of vaccinated vaccines to be produced, then the number of vaccines to be produced in developing countries will decrease.
Mr. John Nkengasong, director of the African Centers for Disease Control (CDC), also expressed concern about the issue.
As some commentators on day-to-day issues have shown, even if the vaccine has been successfully developed, it is not possible to achieve the goal of seeing after the disease, so the distribution of the vaccine is designed, which is an important issue for the international community.
It is important for the international community to strengthen their cooperation.
The WHO director-general, Tedros, also pointed out that, if you want to see after the pandemic, it must be prevented from all walks of life across the globe, that it is impossible for some parts of the world, or just a few countries, to achieve recovery from the impact of the pandemic alone.

You have been summoned by Buhari's government to accompany his father's grave in court.
A Nigerian prosecutor charged you with all the concerns of President Muhammadu Buhari's government that accompanied the funeral of Abba Kyari.
Kyari, who is the Chief of Staff of the President's House of Representatives, was buried at the Government Cemetery in Abuja on 18 April, after he died of the coronavirus.
Prosecutor Tope Akinyade, handed them over to the Magistrate's Court in Kado, Abuja, where he asked the court to punish them for violating the law to kill people at home by the federal government at the time.
He said there was a serious injustice for Nigerians who were arrested and sentenced during mandatory domestic detention, but also for a group of people who violated the law, none of whom had been convicted.
He said that as long as the Buhari justice administration is under threat, there is no reason why the poor should be arrested if they violate the Corona law.
Some of them have violated the law, but they are allowed to.
Among those who have been tried by Tope for you, are the Federal Government Secretary, Boss Mustapha, Minister of Transportation, Hadi Sirika, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, Minister of Agaj and Jinkai, Sadiya Umar.
There are also President's Press Spokesperson, Garba Shehu, Social Media Press Officer, Bashir Ahmed, President Buhari's Adviser on Security Affairs, Babagana Monguno, Police General's Deputy, Mohammed Adamu, and many other senior government issues.
Justice Celestine Odo has asked for evidence that the plaintiff made a mistake since the plaintiffs did not sign up for their case.
However, Tope reminded the prosecutor that he had brought the case directly to court, not to follow through with the police.
He said it was the duty of the judge to send all the petitioners to heaven to sign.
He did what Nigerian law gave him the right to file a lawsuit.
The court heard the case and said that he would return to court on August 4 to continue hearing.

President Muhammadu Buhari's response to the PDP's call for President Muhammadu Buhari Murabus
The House of Representatives said the main opposition party in Nigeria, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), violated the law.
The President's Special Assistant for Media Affairs, Garba Shehu, made the announcement in a statement issued on Friday night.

Shehu said, at the same time that the world as a whole is unifying for a single-point strike, the Nigerian opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party, the PDP began the campaign for election.
This is a tradition that contradicts the country's constitution, calling for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari for allowing investigations into several government offices, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
According to the statement made by the party's president, Prince Uche Secondus, it is clear that they would like the president to suspend the investigation but to close things down.
The lion is not to be awakened from sleep, as one of their leaders has said.
The PDP can't scare the government from enacting harsh accusations against MDAs and their leaders because failing to do so would be a history of public treason.

The government of Katsina and the Poor People's Bankruptcy Group is said to be the leader of the People's Republic of China's President Abdullahi - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
We need to get back to the truth in Nigeria.
Former Chief Justice of the National Court of Appeals, Sharia Umaru Abdullahi (Walin Hausa) stated that the reconciliation of the Katsina State Government with the gunmen, was a major mistake and the money wasted by the poor.
Because it did not affect or signal an end to the murders of the militants in the state of Katsina.
Shari'ah Umaru Abdullahi explained this during a special conversation with Newsmasters at his home in Katsina, including in Leadership Today.

The President of the National Court of Appeals, however, added that the reconciliation with the gunman should not be carried out.
He said that the terrorist had brought a <0x24>250,000 rifle and returned to the woods, and bought a 47-year-old rifle.
Hausa continued that nowhere else in the world can lead to success, must be reconciled with them, by improving the lives of shepherds, i.e. providing caregivers, schools, drinking water and health care.
Although the Ministry of Animal Welfare is located in the northern province, and every year the Government at every stage budgets only the farmers, but the herdsmen, apart from them, must come up with reforms and justice, and then there will be a lasting peace.
But this war won't bring about the land and the Son of the Observer, because all of them are citizens of the country, and reconciliation is the proper way.
He will do it with good intentions, and peace will be found.
This does not affect us.
Our children and grandchildren will live in the future, which is a big problem.
In the world there has never been a battle with a rifle that is armed with a rifle, on which a table is reconciled.
Security experts say that there is no reconciliation with terrorists, this is a conspiracy, because even if America says it does not reconcile with terrorists, they are not their own terrorists, they are the people of another country who are attacking.
We are also members of this community, but we are not going to be able to
