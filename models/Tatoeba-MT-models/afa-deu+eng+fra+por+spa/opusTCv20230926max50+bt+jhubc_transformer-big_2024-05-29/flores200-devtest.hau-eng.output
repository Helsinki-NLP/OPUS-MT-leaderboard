There in the savanna area, it is difficult for a naturally occurring ape family with a human-type dietary melting system to satisfy its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Moreover, refusing to do so has adverse consequences: such as lack of growth, lack of nutritious food, and finally death.
The fastest-used plant minerals have remained nutrients that can be found in leaf and grape, but these are harder for our kind of organisms to melt until they are cooked.
Contrary to this, animal foods (poultry, goat, eggs) can not only be melted easily, but they produce a multitude of chemicals that contain all the essential amino acids.
Considering all of this, we should not be surprised if our predecessors solved the "nutrient problem" in the same way that the monkeys in the savanna area are doing today.

Trail lines have been produced in England since the 16th Century.
Although the horse's wheels consisted of wood in a row, they provided more opportunities for the drums that attracted them to make with red larger cargoes than on the modern-day warning roads.
Crossties were made early enough to stand the lines. However, carefully, it was found that the lines would be better suited if they had an iron shaft on top of them.
This became a common practice, and then the metal caused further damage to the wooden wheels.
Finally, timber and steel tyres were replaced. In 1767 the first railroad metalworking was launched.
The first known transport route is to walk on foot, people began to walk in the footsteps of two million years ago during the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning man's legs).
Their opponents, Australopithecus, did not walk along the stretch as it was in nature.
The experience of two-legged travelling animals has been found in the historical bones of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, though perhaps Sahelanthropus has walked with two legs since seven million years ago.
We can start a new era for the environment, we can take part in an effort to improve the environment, and we can be a fighter to reduce future hardship at some point.
However, if we don’t just want to deal with it for a while, then we should find the source of the problems, and kill them.
It is clear that the world has changed dramatically due to human advancement in science and technology, and problems have increased dramatically as a result of the disproportionate population and human behavior.

Many fossilists today believe that one dinosaur group has survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they're part of the dinosaurs because they're thick and can fly up.
But there are some things about birds that look like dinosaurs.

In this all-in-one transport switcher with support, it is a transportation system that relies on individual vehicles.
Science now shows that this major carbon economy has destroyed the biosphere from one of the most reliable countries that supported human development two million years ago.
Everyone enters the public and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries, such complaints are not heard about the quality of water or bridges that are falling.
Why do transport systems cause such bubbles, and why do they fall down on a daily basis? Are transport engineers just professionals? Is there something important going on?
Traffic management is the study of the individual traffic of drivers and vehicles between the two locations with their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, checking the traffic of motorists is difficult because it is not possible to predict the actual driver's behavior 100%.
At the same time, their drivers drive in a relaxed manner as the flow of motorists on the street walks in bed so that the situation can be studied by means of mathematics.
In order to introduce the situation of the road, the relationships are arranged between three important issues: (1) running, (2) eating and (3) dissipating.
These relationships help to organize, design, and manage products in a great way.
