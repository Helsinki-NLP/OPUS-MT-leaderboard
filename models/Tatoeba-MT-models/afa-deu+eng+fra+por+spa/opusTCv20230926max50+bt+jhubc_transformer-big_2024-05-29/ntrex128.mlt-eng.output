Ams from Wales fear to "be seen as foolish"
There is a co-externalization among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This was raised due to plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament assembly.
Around the political spectrum AMs are worried that this will make them appear ridiculous .
AM Labour said his group was concerned that "this has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In Wales twp means ibleh and pwp means raw.
Plaid's AM said that the whole group ‘was unhappy and suggested alternatives.
A conservative from Wales said his group had a "open mind" about the name change, but noted that there was a small verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this kunest the letter w in the language of Wales is pronounced in a manner similar to the pronunciation of the letter and.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptor of that to be called the Members of the Assembly will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act empowered the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that had broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the AMs title, the Commission favoured Members of Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching a consensus could be headache for the presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how they should be called when they have a debate on legislation.
A referendum on the change in the name of the country is held in the hands of the public
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up with the aim of resolving a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbors represents .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a plebiscite opponent over the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the consequence of entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Stop Playing as Churches in Harlem Send
"Historically, the elders I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today, there is no."
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People are socialising differently" today.
"Bars are no longer the center of activity of the locality where people go on a regular basis."
Regarding the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders think, "and sooner or later they will end up where they were at the beginning."
He added that churches can be replaced with apartment blocks with condominiums filled with the kind of people that will not help the rest of the locality's shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in this building will be white caravans," he said, "and thus, they will not be bored when the day comes to be created for these churches because most of these people who enter and live in these condominiums will likely not become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by congregations of white carpenters before Harlem became a metropolis of white carpenters - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist Congregation of white carpenters departed in the 1930s.
A congregation of black carnival people who were practicing nearby religion took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken from a congregation of black carnival people under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who ran a boycott of retailers at 125 Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted renting to or promoting black carnival people.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as Father Johnson parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and successor to St. Martin's, was proud to call the carillon "the bells of the people."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a "Cultural Treasury" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the world's first carillon to have a black carpenter musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who walked for the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's hasn't changed with anyone else.
What has happened in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some introduced by lay church leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The 'vestry' - the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in inciting architects and contractors sent by the vestrio.
Some of the parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old shark injures a 13-year-old boy during a lobster dive in California
A 13-year-old shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was dancing for a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was dancing with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then went to see him with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement after catching a lobster, but then "did he realise he was screaming, 'Give me!
Give me a break!'
"It's been a long time since he's been in the hospital," Hamel said, realizing the moment the boy had arrived.
"He screamed for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
They took the boy by helicopter to a Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said in a meeting with the media that the shark was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was determined to be not a species of dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with curb corridors similar to those of a 'department store' of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market revenue, which continues to grow as sales of clothes and household goods declines, larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and the idea will be more successful in a year.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use the shelf space that was once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double the amount of beauty items it is offering up to 3,000 items, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with brand areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are fit for vegans - something that is increasingly being demanded by smaller buyers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will examine concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, which the first one opened in Croydon, Lower London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, a year later.
Shopping online and switching to shopping with small amounts of food every day in local convenience stores means that supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly look like 'department stores' as the supermarket chain tries to fight against stores that discount Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has long placed Argos stores in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitats since he bought the two chains two years ago, which he says has boosted groceries sales and made more profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the bond ended after a fight over how to divide income from pharmacy stores into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds will play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been tailored to suit every need and the attractive environment and the convenient positions of the stores mean that we have become a destination of beauty products of interest challenging the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'severely earned' after Holly Willoughby cancels <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den Peter Jones' personality is 'very angry' after television presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for branding household products and accessories of them, Truely.
The pair's business has been compared with the firm of Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop.
This morning's 37-year-old actress appeared on Instagram to announce that she would leave.
Holly Willoughby has left a character of "Dragons" Den Peter Jones very angry because he has cancelled from being part of their last-minute life-style business - to focus on her big contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "very angry" when the very popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enrom business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - would cost him enough time to access the goods - meant it was not difficult.
The business was compared with the firm of Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she was leaving with Truly, Jones left Britain and went to one of his private villagers.
A source said: "Truely was by far Holly's first priority.
It would be her long-term future that would fill her for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone completely amazed.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost over.
There is a store filled and produced at Marlow's headquarters that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning's presenter, one of Britain's lucrative personalities, could mean a cost of millions for the company due to a large investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and the potential for further delays to its launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truely with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, came with them as chairman in March.
Couples travel together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an embassy of the M<0x26>S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity ITV's presenter.
Last night, a close source told Jones: "We don't comment on his economic affairs."
It's hard, but we've found love
He joked about criticism he would earn from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "non-presidential" and for being so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did you give up on President Trump?
Trump said with a voice to mimic that of a "news presenter".
"I didn't say anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump boasted that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But they stopped the denuclearization negotiations.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a "correspondent response" from the United States to the early steps of the Korean peninsula.
Instead, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his manifesto speech.
He said, "We're going well with North Korea".
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - the end of the rocket tests, aid in relief of hostages and the return of American veterans who had remained home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were unnecessary.
Even after more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to move from home, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is a challenge," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign personnel can operate on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Considering earthquakes occurring in Indonesia frequently, the country is still not well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While shelter from the tsunamis was built in Aceh, you don't see them very much on the coast.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite issuing a warning, has likely contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was stationed in Lombok to care for the victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to the falling infrastructure of Indonesia, the centre of his election campaign, spending a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr Joko's administration sent due to a lack of funds as he faced his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions still in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to move as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the road, using ‘machetes', bows and arrows and other types of weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores at the last minute vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a ‘goal’ in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shakri while he was 27 metres away from Chelsea's ladder with his team losing 1-0.
Hit the ball a little to his left before shooting the ball into the stack.
The ball goes up most of the box as it ends up in the top right side of the net.
Eventually, the ball landed behind Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped to try to greet, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get into that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always send him forward as much as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming at me and I hit the ball once and I didn't think much about it and I tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 to half of the game after they brought a ‘goal’ in the 25th minute by the very good Belgian player Eden Hazard.
Chelsea striker passes the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before leaving running to the middle of the stadium and then quickly enter the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly passes the ball in the middle of the pitch.
Then he shot the ball very nicely, which led Hazard inside the box.
Hazard ran more than the players in the defense and sent the ball into the net with his left foot and passed to Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool will fight against Napoli in the Champions League team stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Many people have been reported trapped under the collapse of the building that fell due to the 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, a spokesman from the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was filled with collapses from the collapsed building.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was killed with a knife
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.

I would also like to appeal to everyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on the dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information that is vital to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
Friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police have said they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to re-enter his apartment but is being informed by police that no one should be allowed to enter or exit the building.

A number of police officers were inside the enclosed area monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and quote log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's Parliament statue becomes the last monument hit by the argument about 'rewriting history'
Its removal would be a form of justice appropriate for the similar destruction of the Taliban, of many of the British religious and cultural artifacts carried out by his fanatical ‘Puritan’ followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The 'iconoclasm' of the British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of a 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliament's defender against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th-century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as ‘Lord Protector’ also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig Killer Attack and Kills a Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a blood-covered cut arthritis near a burial in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject the vaccines in pigs at ‘hoggery' on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
Allegedly, he travelled with his cousin from the near province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he discovered a door to the nearby pig's necklace open.
He said there was a pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked and killed the farmer, according to the report.
"Cousins' legs were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin, who referred to him by his surname "Wu," as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to not attack others, while police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been previously recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until the animal expelled his wife.
After a farmer's pigs from Oregon attacked him and ate him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "cause."
"They're playing.
They're very curious, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's debris will bring heavy rainfall to the southeast of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rains around northern Mexico and in the southeast of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a wind of 85 mph, a Category 1, hurricane at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it is forming a ‘trough’ over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa is approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm United States will begin to push the strong tropical humidity-increasing rainstorm.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity interacting with the approaching 'trough' creates heavy rainfall spreading in the southeast in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will cause dangerous rapid flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 inches of rainfall are expected in parts of the Southwest, especially on most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered character of the tropical rainfall.
It is not a good idea to go out in the desert walking with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause the ‘canyons’ to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring in many local and dusty winds.
The 'trough' will bring some rain to parts of California's southern coast.
They are possible total rainfall of more than half an inch, which can cause small flows of breakdowns and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of their rainy season region.
Some floods of scattered tropical rainfall begin to move to Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes further scattered late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall spreads in Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October, there may be some severe temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic cools down, but tropical areas remain fairly warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a huge example of dramatic temperature differences from the U.S. Center on Sunday.
There is almost a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures in the 1980s spread from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City can climb up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is roughly 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts are indicating high odds for above-average temperatures to the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended the hearings of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting testimony on Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with the shocking last-minute news of Friday: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh babasha when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to undress her when they were a post-secondary school-level party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate witness, said he was 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday saw it.
the company was counting the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers there are from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is an audience size similar to that for the decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinions strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was just behind him with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, those who protested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning were apprehended and yelling at him as he tried to climb the elevator for a session of the Judiciary Committee.
He stayed there standing with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, in a live broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to a country?"
He said, "I have power when many women don't have anything."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcasting live, hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate in full for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee in the following week, which Democratic minorities have been urging.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power, as it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of being "taken advantage of politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "taking advantage" of politics and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May came to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview after one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely exhausted.
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the spot and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports the CBS's affiliate, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bond was set at <0x24>350,000, the Advocate reports.
East Baton Rouge Parish's coroner's office has issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying that the cause of death is damage from a gun from the head to the neck.
The department is giving credit to the Louisiana State Police clandestine task force, the state police crime laboratory, the Southern University police and the residents of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement for "diligence and the quest for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker who was 2 meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 ‘rebounds’ per game in the past season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "lost" and "shocked" after Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Vulkan throws ashes on Mexico City
Ash being dumped by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern area of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention has warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several noises and tectonic movements.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash that covered car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography physicists noted an increase in volcanic activity located 45 miles (72 kilometres) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with separatists from Catalonia ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-revolution police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan polarisation vote on the incident.
A group of face-covered separatists who were held back by riot police washed eggs and dust dyes, creating a cloud of dark dust on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also minor clashes during the day and police had to use the triggers to control the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups were giving "Don't forget, don't apologize" fighting against unionist protesters who were shouting, "Spain Forever."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions remained high in the region that wants independence a year after the October 1 referendum seen as illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatists from Catalonia.
Voters chose with a large gap to become independent, although participation was low with those opposed to the secession who made a large boycott against the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region in violent clashes.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said they did not give up hope in the prospects for Catalan independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my mom and dad crying with joy that they could vote but now we're alone," he said.
Despite having had a vital and narrow victory in last December's regional elections, Catalonia's independence parties are sending to maintain the momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders either in subsequent exile or in organizing the referendum themselves or in detention and waiting for the trial.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of police, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"There's going to be more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of Catalonia's nine leaders who has been incarcerated since the end of last year, announced that he will contest in next year's European Parliament elections.
"By coming out as a candidate for the European elections it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonerry: Man arrested after a car crashed into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car forced into a house in Londonderry more than once.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday for the crash of 19:30 BST.
Investigative inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the buildings themselves.
A ‘crossbow’ may also have been used to shoot at the car at some point.
Menga's goal wins 1-0 game for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first 'goal' for Livingston won the game
Livingston, who was promoted, slammed Rangers and thus lost Steven Gerrard for the second time only in 18 games as Ibrox's 'club' coach.
Dolly Menga's ball shot made all the difference as Gary Holt's side equalised points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side hasn't won once outside her stadium in the Premiership this season and the next Sunday will play against Hearts, who is the first and behind them with eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in their stadium in the Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continues to have no loss in the division in six matches, with head coach Holt not yet losing a match since he was replaced by Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against large visitors
Holt's team should have long been winning before having had a 'goal', with its direct style of play that was causing many problems for Rangers..
Scott Robinson managed to pass but passed the ball in front of the stall, then Alan Lithgow could only distribute the ball with a wide body after sliding to receive the ball from the head blow from Craig Halkett near the stall.
Those who were playing in their own stadium were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that they were able to give visitors problems at certain times.
And that's how he came up with the crucial 'goal'.
Rangers let a 'free-kick' in and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and brought it into the stick from the center of the box.
By that moment, Rangers were dominating possession of the ball, but were finding the defense of the team they were playing in their own stadium, unpenetrable, and the 'goalkeeper' Liam Kelly had little trouble,
That style of play continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to pick up the ball.
Scott Pittman failed to find a 'goal' because of Rangers Allan McGregor's 'goalkeeper' and Lithgow shot the ball wide after giving him another Livingston player.
Balls were constantly entering Livingston's box and were always removed from their players, while two requests for 'penalty' - after Halkett's attempt on substitute Glenn Middleton, and another after the ball was touched by a player's hands - were rejected.
Phenomenal' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Arena Tony Macaroni
Performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
The style of the games and their staff have not changed much from the return to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way he has joined the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett's chief was very great in his games, organising an immensely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall with seven eyes.
However, Rangers had a lack of inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain times under Gerrard, there was a lack of standards well this time.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - just once they managed to separate the defense of the team that was playing in his own stadium - and it is a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the ranking.
Reuters has received a number of responses in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) people laughed and heard blue as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - with the aim of repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then left for Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have cited security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 from being gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters have emerged nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also spoke out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome the country.
Protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero for certain German Turks and is thought to be 'autocrat' from others.
Crash in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died in a crash involving a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a bustling street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended the paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a car and continued to drive to Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus deviations are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officials Arrested in Disorder
Six prison officials were injured after a disturbance in a high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Office.
The disorder began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 9:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialised officials "Tornado" were introduced to address the disorder, which involves eight prisoners and is located in one of the sections.
Officers were treated for minor injuries on the ground.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "A specially trained prison staff has been deployed to address an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Latin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of those who have committed the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year anti-riot officers were called to prison to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with ‘pool’ balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake city with Rapid Floods (Drought Areas Can Benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression hits Arizona, but this is likely to occur early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves from the southwest of the desert, leading to risks of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already set up a rapid flood watch for Monday and Tuesday to from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a status of tropical storm or depression at a distance of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest Uragan National Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with insulated amounts up to 6 inches in the Arizona Rim Mogollon.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to have from an inch to 2 inches, with possible insulated totals up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, the Rosa rain may be a positive thing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the southwestern side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category," they reported from weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa led it to reach the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which will still be a very strong hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific and is losing power.
As a result, it is expected to hit Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be severe, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California northwest of Sonora, with a probability of not more than 10 inches," they reported from weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and will then move from Arizona and south of Utah until late evening on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or from its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and in the southwestern desert of the United States," they said from the National Center of Uragans.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening rapid floods and breakdown streams in the deserts, and avalanches in the mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old teenager was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
They took him to the hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, said Somerset Police.
Officials appealed for anyone who could have a video drawn from the mobile phone of what happened to speak.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘sends the greenness and anger’ of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking Democratic Party tactics," Trump said during a demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “sends the greenness and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denied an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, the American people saw Kavanaugh's "braveness and quality and courage."
"A vote confirming to Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming to one of the most committed legal minds of our time, a jury with an impeccable public service record", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
"I'm not arguing, but I'm actually arguing," he said.
"So I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates."
Trump has argued that Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first main procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant of the GOP's leadership told CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake, the tsunami, with the number of deaths rising
At least 384 people have been killed and many have been carried as huge waves have slipped on beaches after a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six metres (18 ft) fell forcefully on the ground as it began to dark, while many carried and died and destroyed everything that was in the middle.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not rise to occur immediately and end up being victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB during a briefing.
"The tsunami did not emerge alone, drew cars, logs, houses, hit everything that was on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled along the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed the trees to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, self-censored bridges and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Strong earthquakes continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy that emerged from the massive earthquake of Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that landed on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the geography of the city, located at the edge of a long and narrow bay, could have enlarged the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the breakdown of a collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications "were totally sent and without information" by Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a shared amateur video on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting alarming warnings for the tsunami that was approaching people on the underway.
Within a few minutes, a huge amount of water drowned on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the movies.
The quake and tsunami caused strong light cuts that reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military has started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuations still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived strong and full in the city of Palu, where the employees were sheltering armed tarp shelters in their office yard, they went through scenes of devastation on their way there, Mr Doseba said.
He said, "They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed".
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups began the unpleasant process of aid in disasters, some complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competences were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start entering if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we can bring in international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that embellish this story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy came out of a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national team coach of Paragliding, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional weight," he said.
Mr Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the fall of Hotel Roa Roa circulated among the paragliding community, he sent in a way, desperately, WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only signaled that they had left, but did not signal that they had arrived.
"I think that means that the messages didn't come," he said.
Allowed to receive <0x24>26,750 while ATM was being replenished at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling ATMs in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was battling an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While busy with his work, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a money bag intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rap singer changes his name to Ye
Kanye West rap singer is changing his name - to Ye.
While announcing the change in Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was vaccinated Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program that was cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the creator of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'you'," West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I am, you, I am, she is, we are.
From Kanye meaning ‘the only one’, to Ye only - simply a reflection of what we have good, bad, what confuses us, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous rap singers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
As one who collaborated with West, JAY-Z, also served with or without a song and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military personnel against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "he will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
The troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were being set up throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double the funds for the I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area, says the investor and practitioner of the IA Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made IA announcements, even if there is a lack of a formal IA strategy in the U.S..
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for IA research would be a good start, as all other countries are much more backwards than the United States, and we're looking for the next revolutionary step in IA," Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major AI achievement will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that won the player with the highest ranking of American Othello, and later he was executive with Microsoft Research and the chairman of Google's branch in China.
Lee has recognized previous U.S. government competitions in technology such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be the next, in order to help identify the next viewers.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
Lee said, "It's not China that's removing academic leaders; corporations are doing it,".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on AI.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the United States to strengthen their efforts in AI.
He said, "I believe the green card should be offered automatically to people who have a Doctorate in AI".
China's State Council released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations spend money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that has attempted to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has seen no action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country;
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "the Republic of North Macedonia," a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked its membership offers for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbour in its north represents a possibility of possession of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the participation will reach the 50 percent minimum necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote reads: "You are in favour of membership in NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the name change of the country giving him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was installing a small stage and preparing seats in front of armed tents by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we must proudly enter under our conditions, not by commanding others," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a result in favour of the name change would be a "confirmation of our future."
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum - an amount below that of the required participation.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must be 50 percent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious blow to the government's policy in favour of Western ideologies since it took control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passes Brighton's entire defense for 'goal'
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 'goal' in the 65th minute seemed very easy.
The striker from Argentina received a ball from half the stadium at the start of the sequence.
A race between three Brighton defenders before he ran into an open open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green flakes.
Fighting with one defender before escaping from much more with the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he passed the ball on his left and found Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute it to Aguero, who used the right foot to insert the ball to the right side of the net by passing it from where Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero is suffering with some leg problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the good fortune to make a "goal" at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the Premier League fight.
That 'goal' occurred in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball very inwardly in Brighton territory in that action.
He sent the ball straight to Leroy Sane with the left hand in a very beautiful way.
Sane touched the ball shortly before leading to Sterling where the stick.
The Sky Blues striker touched the ball a little and brought it into the net just before sliding into a territory he was not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim at the Champions League team stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in a spoiler vs. Rockies
Since Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to start again.
But so competitive player Scherzer hopes to be the 'pitcher' on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which is in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in a single game in the NL.
The Rockies have managed to gain a possibility to continue competing with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday evening, but are still seeking to get the division's first title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can have the possibility to win because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What do you not want to compete in these circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer be the "pitcher" in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start for 34 times, had a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is usually resting.
The player from Washington who plays with his right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 'strikeout' in 220 2/3 'innings' this season.
Trump's Manifestations in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation relating to the selection for his Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"In November, everything we've done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very big -- I don't contest, but in fact, I'm contesting so I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates," he said.
"We're seeing this very horrific and radical group of Democrats, we're seeing it happen now," Trump continued.
And they are determined to take back power by using any means possible, you can see the greenness.
"They don't care who hurts, who they want to fly in order to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give them."
He said Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And I've seen this over the last four days," he said, and he was calling the Democrats "angry and green and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to Democratic Senator ranked on the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by her name, and received many negative outcry from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, no, no, I expect, first of all - the movements of her body were nothing positive - the worst movements I've ever seen."
The group is no longer a large group.
Don't allow people to communicate their opinions
When my local activists voted to censor me, I didn't take a big turn.
After all, I am the most recent MP in a list of Labour Party MPs that was not welcomed in a positive way - because we communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought against antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of Friday evening's General Council were exactly that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "merciful and gentler" policy has long been forgotten if, in fact, it has ever begun in the truth.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect to change my understandings and take positions that I would never agree with in other situations - both on national security and on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in fact, it doesn't make any difference to say - they follow me with abuse on social media with a request to remove me from my MP post, denounce the policy of the centre, and tell me that I don't have a part of the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
Yes, I know I've had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a lot of sexual or racist abuse every day but are never concealed from comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that abuse levels have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with any motion of "distrust" or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
I have been given a lot of advice over the last two years that have encouraged me to keep my opinions for me, not to be so vocal and then everything "will be fine."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, driven by the negligence of Thatcher's government that left my comprehensive school class literally in a disastrous state, I have sought to improve public services for those most in need - whether as a minister or a local councillor.
I've never been in politics, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I say is that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Party leader.
But in truth, the only message that I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to work for you and promise you that no amount of threats to remove me from my post or to discourage me from political expedition.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who hasn't lost once, climbs to the top of the rankings
Two attempts could have slightly changed the result, but there was no doubt that Ayr had deserved to win this so exciting day game of Tennant's Premiership.
They are currently the first in the ranking, the only team out of all ten that did not lose once.
Ultimately, it was the superior defense, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing in its own stadium, win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've had some trials in our matches so far, and we haven't lost one yet, so I'm happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "We give the credit to Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we do."
With Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, but, a yellow card from Scotland's head Rory Hughes, who was allowed to play the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baunt did not.
Climo extended Ayr's victory with 'penalty', before, in the middle of the match just, made a 'goal' and converted an individual attempt to have the points come 17-5 for Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggott, narrowed the gap by 5 points.
Then the game stopped due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who stepped out of the stadium on a streaker, and as soon as the game resumed, Ayr continued to tighten points after an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Then, Ayr Blair Macpherson's chief agent was given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose emerged aggressively when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team he was playing in his own stadium again began to attack, and when he was given a yellow card Struan Hutchinson for the action he made on Climo without the ball, from the 'penalty' line, MacPherson touched the ball to the ground at the back of the advancing Ayr group.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the area from which the game restarts, after Kyle Rowe picked up the ball that met David Armstrong out of the box and sent Gregor Henry, who plays sideways, to the fifth attempt of the side she was playing in her own stadium.
Still Game's personality seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Ford Kieran's personality appears to be willing to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old husband who makes the part of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program, which he writes and participates in with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next nine series would be the last of the program, and it seems that Kiernan is planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to official records lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The player refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was seeking to engage in Glasgow's "very well-going restaurant trade".
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes court reopens passage to the Pacific
The sailors guard the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
A public building has an ocean-colored blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours right away.
Recovering it is a duty."
Around the whole of Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict of resources is still clear - as the desire for Bolivians to be able to sail in the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope lies perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is obviously waiting for the outcome with a positive thought," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favour of Bolivia's statement, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate for the Bolivian.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's indigenous charismatic president - facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year - also has a lot to lose in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to having access to the Pacific Ocean again," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia - and that little would change if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant Chile's territory, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ's judgment comes only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicating that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favouring Bolivia's case, the last four years may have been unhelpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The hostile rhetoric of Morales weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Velzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, denied the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place until it can trust the United States
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons is the first if it cannot trust Washington.
He spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
He passes his comments as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart the stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "hope in the blank" that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether it should agree with the statement without Pyongyang making the first significant steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious to renounce an arm that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of massive headwear that will soon appear in the main stores.
If you want to add to your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you can stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a range of strange and very large headwear for their 2019 Spring and Summer collection on the runway that has adorned the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractice hats are appearing a lot on Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their surprising creations to the stage.
The object highlighted most by Valentino was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a broad feather-like edge that completely covered the heads of the patterns.
Other very large-sized accessories included jeweled melting, witch hat and even pineapples - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thomas Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had sewn lips and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than a ‘haute couture'.
One reaction resembled the complete diving apparatus with snorkels and goggles, while another resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue with this kind of good luck.
Fashion-followers predict that huge 'bonnets' will soon appear in the main stores.
The very large hats come out after the release of 'La Bomba', the two-foot wide-wing straw hat that was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The 'cult label' responsible for the impractical hat that appeared a lot on social media flew another great creation on stage - a strawbag containing almost as much as the mesh-weared model it was carrying.
The dark orange raffle basket, surrounded by a tiny raffle thread and a white leather strap, was the most prominent creation in Jacquesmus' 2019 Spring and Summer collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm expecting to see big hats and sea bags in the main stores for the coming summer - as the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories.'
John Edward: Language Skills Essential for Global Citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is only enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to the students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, for their chosen career and for their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain a subject of popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If a man speaks in a language he understands, he understands with his mind.
If you speak in his own language, he will understand with his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the forefront of ranking tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher A degree.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are members of the SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a Higher A degree in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who study German, 69 percent of those who study French and 63 percent who study Spanish also achieved.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a choice of subject, kept in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Jobs and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons given by employers for sending them to fill job vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if you learn another language, it will have a real advantage in the future as it will have the ability to survive such a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual leader in the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and, with 15 percent, French is the only spoken language with a two-digit percentage.
That's why investment in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot be denied at present, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, and therefore this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be seen as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
On Sunday, LeBron will play for the first time with the Lakers in San Diego.
LeBron James' sports fans didn't expect him to start for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game before the season begins on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the amount of minutes to play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that, likely, James would play a limited amount of minutes.
After the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the schedule of the six games before the Lakers season begins.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's Manifestation in West Virginia, Youtube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign demonstrations in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five demonstrations scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a suspended confirmation vote for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are at risk of losing Congressional control when votes are cast in Nov.
What is Trump's manifesto in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
Trump's manifestation in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's manifestation in West Virginia online below through a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become intense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an anticipated confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for up to a week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary goal of this wave of demonstrations is to help Republicans face the November elections to gain some momentum.
President Trump's campaign said the five demonstrations next week were aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"Congress control is so important for this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach the busy campaign season," he told Reuters a campaign spokesman for Trump, who declined to be named.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening demonstration could gather supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
It will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is losing in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to try to boost him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team determined not to give up while approaching Sunday's singles
After three rounds of one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been exactly what she needed for this Ryder Cup.
The momentum swing pendulum is a fully invented sport concept but one in which players really believe, and never more than in such competitions.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were in the lead with six points and now they're four, so I think we're carrying this as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points at the forefront with twelve more to play.
Americans, says Spieth, feel but have a bit of a hindrance and have a lot to encourage them, not at least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points out of four.
Spieth was accurate from tee to green and is running by example.
That scream from the heart of a celebration continued to grow as he continued his round, making a crucial putt to get the fourth match even when he and Thomas were two below behind two.
His pitcher, who won the match over 15, was greeted by a similar shout, the kind that tells you that he believes the American team is still there.
"You have to go deeper and worry about your own item," Spieth said.
That's what each of these players have to do now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sweet couple are four by four and are considered perfect.
"Moliwood" were the only pair that did not scurry bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the following Friday morning nine.
That run, and the way their energy seems to move both to and from this live crowd establishes that they are the players who are offering a challenge on Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at once on different holes.
But here we are talking about a European glory that is too early for it.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly completed by Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when she was put in a pair with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine brought the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole that they could never get close to getting out of.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to see closely due to peer-to-peer interactions, advice they give, advice they do not give and the way a strategy can turn into a second.
Europe played better as a team so came here and is in the lead on the final day but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. Team has the determination that some, especially on the U.S. side, were skeptical.
Europe in the lead with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good turn on the final day of the Ryder Cup after exiting from the top four balls and Saturday's foursomes with 10-6 on the United States.
The inspired pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the effort with two wins over Tiger Woods who found it difficult to take their score so far at the Le Golf National for four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, ready to hold the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in the morning fourballs, which took the series by 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but could not reach the difference in score.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points out of Sunday's 12 single-player matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European to win four points in a row while he and Mollinari, called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are just the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After dominating on Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs then worked excellently to win Woods' unseen optimist and the new American player for the season Bryson Dechambeau with an even more empathetic score of 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who found difficulty in both matches on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in the fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2<0x26>1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
But it wasn't all that Europe wanted on a beautiful day, with a little breath in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a big three-time winner, and Justin Thomas set the limit for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a bold 2<0x26>1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and returned later to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4<0x26>3 in the foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team returned from a four-point difference while entering the singles, although Furyk side holders need a habit to hold the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday's clash seems to be more than they can do.
North Korea says it will "in no way" dismantle unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that ongoing sanctions were deepening its lack of trust in the United States and that there was no way the country would unilaterally leave its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances in no way will we unilaterally dismantle ourselves first."
While Ri reiterated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would have been rewarded as it took steps gradually, his statement appeared significantly that it did not refuse the pass-Pong-Pyong denuclearization as unilaterally without consideration.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a U.S. president serving his duties and a leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work towards the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula."
North Korea was seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to reduce tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a coherent way, and even objects to the "declaration of an end to war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our lack of trust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of denuclearisation were South Korea and not the United States it would have been like this denuclearization of the penis."
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea's rocket-propelled U.S. mainland was inevitable after Mr. President Trump called Kim's "successful mission" a "man-of-the-master."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to dismantle, but said much work remained to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying "if it takes two, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without stopping until we realize the fully and finally verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with the aim of halting funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, after North Korea criticised him in a few hours for making "gangster-like demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "correspondent measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "correspondent measures" he was looking for were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on taking enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has managed to get all of its undergraduates to sleep more with the aim of fighting the growing Macho culture of studying all night and staying awake thanks to coffee.
Academics have found that university students in first place in the world often do not have an idea of the basic real things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after making a speech about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"A girl came to me last time and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my last year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essential things about how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding the students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a student's bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell them about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance will have an effect from sleep deficiency, and the importance of routine sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term insomnia can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know - as much as you have a right to know the health effects when choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of being proud that "you managed to stay up all night studying" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that insomnia was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep enough, and of good quality, should be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, intense fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, as lack of sleep puts the mind in a hunger-making mode.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who is studying chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduated students to do a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can unbalance your circadian rhythm, and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal lends to Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of sadness when playing abroad as Dolly Menga's strike delivered Steven Gerrard's split side to a 1-0 loss in Livingston.
Ibrox's side were seeking to make a record of their first win while traveling from the February 4-1 triumphal victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused a second defeat of Gerrard in a big 18-party Labrord's Labrod's side as manager to leave points to his side.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and Rangers' list of inspirational players never seemed to catch up.
While Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and only after Hibernian on a goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after Linesman Callum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently throwing an object on the side of the team's supporters who played abroad.
Gerrard made eight changes to the Ayr side to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same 11 Lives that took a point from Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-trained form hampered their opponents continuously.
Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to score just two minutes from the start when Menga's first-time play-off sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder took his big shot.
A strong free-kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found Craig Halkett's skipper but his defender partner Alan Lithgow could only fly from behind.
Rangers gained control but it seemed there was more hope than belief about their game in the third final.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he had to have a penalty on the 15-minute mark as he and Steven Lawless struggled but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian appeals.
Rangers managed to well target two strides only in the first half of the match but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely worried him about Lassana Coulibaly's head blow and Ovie Ejaria's slight strike.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that he just deserved them for their effort.
Once again, Rangers failed to manage a good set-piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher shoots the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga to end the action.
Gerrard reacted in the brake by switching to Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the winger fired at Morelos but impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston went on to draw visitors to play just the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett catching a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could extend their position in the front in the final stages but McGregor held tight to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went open from the corner.
Rangers' alternate Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked the other side.
Almanak: The inventor of the Geiger Contractor
And now a page from our Almanac of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, as today 136 years old today, and DON'T WORK ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger's Concierge.
A foundation of science since then, Geiger's Convent has become a foundation of pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appear:
The man said, "Is that the madophile?"
Rogers: "That's Geiger's Contactor, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these cuffs, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that give radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "It's definitely popular now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he turned 63.
But the invention of his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behavior
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behavior and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cells with abnormal behavior as part of the treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are converted into a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many cancers and then be re-injected
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, they are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "induces the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach to immune cell taking by patients and how to "teach" how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a Verbal Attack in favour of Trump, while wearing a MAGA Beretta, after his appearance on SNL.
This isn't a good
Kanye West was booked in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would go to the polls in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he wore a great Make America, he began to say against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white person and they say, 'How can you please Trump, that racist?'"
If I were concerned about racism, I would have left America," he said.
SNL began the program with a comedy sketch in which Matt Damon appeared in which the Hollywood star recanted Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not released, West's video is uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make you laugh with West when he posted it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience who had caught up with him after the quintet about his beret.
"Blow me behind the scenes.
He said, "Don't go out there with that berry."
I've been bullied!
Then they say it's lost," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see the lost? and he went on to say that he would "wear my superman's cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
His comments triggered booting at least twice of the audience and members of the SNL cast appeared embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person out there telling the publication: "In the whole studio a great silence has fallen."
West brought him as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West congratulated many on the performance of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West had support from conservative group chairman TPUSA, Candace Turner who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: GRATIES TO TAKE OUT TO THE FOLLOW."
But presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he is and this is something beautiful and memorable."
"But I didn't choose to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
So much more," she added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the former Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The former rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the music legend that is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Indictment of attempted murder on knife stab wounds at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was beaten with a knife at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones Game star Kit Harington talks about toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role in blazing the sword as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke of the hero's stereotype Macho, saying that such roles on the screen mean that youngsters often feel they need to be violent in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old Game of Thrones Rose Leslie costume, also admitted that he has "strong interests" to tackle the issue.
"Personally, I feel I have a strong interest, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its highly male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes the young man feel that he wants to be certain of a man's side?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
It is very clear that something has gone wrong with the boy."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that "so wars and horses".
From November, Kit will appear in the new production of True West of Sam Shepard which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this program, so this way gave me my future family, and my life from now on," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series she won at Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV from sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men will eventually marry women.
Most transmissions of diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has disclosed data of GOP senators, saying "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat has confirmed that claims were being disseminated from "ultra-right" shopping malls and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more detestable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure was made some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with the Waters office and released the information of a Waters staff member, the Hill, reported.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and utterly false."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's a bit of annoyance," Fleisher wrote.
"This suggests that it does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of doing something they haven't done, they shouldn't be angry.
It should not be resistant.
He should not question the defendant's motives.
It should be calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics who appeared too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will emerge to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
"That's great if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned the "appropriate law enforcement authorities and bodies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the authors will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and all members of my staff."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, imitation of a powerless spy
It has now become traditional to seek out Brexit meanings in any new film with a British perspective and this seems applicable to the return of Johnny English's action-comedy imitation franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and revived in 2011 with Johnny English.
Ironic self-sacrifice on the subject of how obviously we are wrong, would be the opportunity for a new export of the country?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with large eyes and parts of his face moving not as usual had the license renewed for a second time to do anything wrong - that name more than anything else shows that it is a widespread comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinema go-lands.
Of course he is the stupid secret agent who despite his strange claims to his sweet enthusiasm has a bit of Clouseau, a hit of Mr. Bean and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the 2012 theme melody of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony.
It is also originally based on the traveler and international man of mystery who once played his part in the Barclaycard TV ads, today forgotten, after leaving chaos behind.
There is a good moment or two in the last issue of JE.
I loved the moment when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter while he was wearing medieval armored clothing and the propeller blades clapped his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy appears, but humor feels rather poor and overly strangely, especially since the film's "serious" brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer comedy as an ingredient in a confident way.
Humor is felt as if it was aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's strange unfortunate incidents were not as inventive and focused as the wordless Atkinson film jokes in Bean's person.
The perennial topical proposition is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's highly secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agent who was at work - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cherry on the cake for the prime minister who is an imperishable and difficult figure, already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character-like Teresa May but there is not much in the script to work.
Its intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, it will have to bring someone retired.
And this means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrated operational: a few good jokes here as English offers a School of Rock spiking academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former very patient partner, Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, with a submarine commander, a role of one stunned interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is a little wasted.
Therefore the two inseparable who always confuse everything in her Mystery Service, are back in action, when they encounter the character of a seductive and beautiful woman, Ophelia Bulletova interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the rule of the sweet technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the prime minister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of funny behavior: dressing up as waiters, setting fire to a high French restaurant, creating chaos to climb onto the luxurious yacht of Volta; and English begins a full anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality cuffs to familiarize himself with the Vulture.
Of course all stops lead to that last sequence, but as friendly and animated as it is, he has a little idea of a children's television.
It's something quite moderate.
And like the other Johnny English movies I couldn't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that he really deserves for his talent?
The Labour Party has denied it is preparing a plan for the British to work for a week of four days but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see Britons work for a week of four days - but be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants companies' educators to pass on the remnants of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them another free day.
This will see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take with them the same pay.
Sources said the idea would be "appropriate" with the party's agenda and economic plans that the country is shifting in favour of workers.
The four-day shift was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected before the end of the year.
"This is not going to happen from today to tomorrow but a four-day working week is an aspiration that suits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's global industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the proposal is currently not being approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a party's policy and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "availing ones" in utility firms.
Opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back their entire stake as a Labour government can make "reductions" based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 percent of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if the Kavanaugh FBI investigation can change their mind
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by one week, raising the question as to whether bureau findings could influence a Republican senator from withdrawing his support.
In a Sunday interview, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"It's fine," said Kennedy.
"I said, and I went into the hearing, and I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after that allegation came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, incoherent."
However, Graham's vote seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it has to be a very big charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And any person who mentions can't verify it.
She is 36 years old.
I didn't see anything change."
What's the World Health Organization (WHO) and what does it do to reduce poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of stars to appear and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people take it to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the true purpose of the event by the end of the 20th.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a representation group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were ready to pay a VIP ticket), those attending the concert had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, send an email to a world leader, make a phone call or other significant ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what was the success of the 12-year-old to achieve his goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feel they are making a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
As of 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which stands for a number of different purposes.
He says these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from its actions, at least <0x24>10 billion of which have already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the secure funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the glow.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," with the promise to provide Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Chileans.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of denture footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, presenting him Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. uses Naval Fleet to "block" Russian energy exports - Home
"If necessary", Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern side of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not arrived on the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing those attending the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that establishes itself as the " energy consumer's voice" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that these are effectively the same.
"The economic choice on Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and replacing fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "one-size-fits-all" with a fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to step out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas project, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "slavery."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 gasoline, which is expected to double the existing gasoline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has invited the United States to stay away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Seriously Examine" whether to Release for President in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "examine well" whether to come out for president after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Hollyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider coming out.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and this includes a woman in the top position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will examine whether or not I will go to the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump at a council meeting, saying he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "naturally we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey released Thursday, showed that a majority of Waren's own constituents do not think it should come out for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not go out for the election, according to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe's Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported the issue for the election.
The poll showed further support for the election exit from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential election exit and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in relation to a potential outage for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD of Track Palin in Donald Trump's Manifesto
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being registered in September
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, I can relate to other families who feel the PTSD ramifications and some of the injuries our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest as "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said about her son and other war veterans, "they return slightly differently, return stronger, return thinking whether there is that respect for what other country soldiers like them and air force personnel, and every other member of the mile."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was brought on trial for a domestic violence attack on a woman, while intercepting with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports a challenge for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district, Friday filed a case of a court friend in Washington to support a policy-challenging asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The actor's full name in Grace vs Sessions' case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the boys members of his violent gang," abused her but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
It was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations face pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine, said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a motive violates this principle, said the case of a friend of the court.
Lawyers continued to argue in the event that the policy of denying immigrants' incomes would harm the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths doubles in fighting time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly frightening.
"It feels very intense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while embracing her child with a fever at an evacuation centre in the unfortunate city of Palu.
"Every minute of ambulance brings the body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents appeared to return to their destroyed homes, searching for their stuff flooded with water, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5, were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture in the back and shoulder, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to ongoing healthy shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he reported that he felt the violent earthquake moving the floor of the hotel on the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have a chance to save ourselves.
I crushed with the remains of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in the place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or her daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper released a four-page ad in a daily U.S. newspaper trying to sell the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China's daily supplement at the Des Moines Register - the newspaper most sold in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the 6th congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a campaign escalating from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that has seen them go through tariff rounds on imports of each.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a leading exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion page in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling this bullying by making propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's precious tradition of free expression and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, on the newspaper stand down the road here in Beijing, you will find voices of limited dissemination and you will not see a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people can have on China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media is found under a restriction."
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has avoided the bid to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Are Envoying Women Voters Before the Mid-term Elections with the Kavanaugh Debate, Warning Analysts
As many top Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while facing various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next midterm elections.
Emotions about this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to run by vote.
These things cannot be reversed," Grant Reheer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University told The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Reheer said he doubted that the last-minute push of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not be forgotten tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate hall as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to lead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst told the news site.
"People are saying they were already high, and it's true.
"But they may be higher, particularly between female voters switching to suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while disliked by the president, often do not vote."
Even ahead of Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts have suggested she could follow an adverse reaction if Republicans lead with confirmation.
"This has become a complete hype for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is put on the bank, it's also about the way Republicans handled this situation and how they handled it," pointed out news station Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect.
However, Americans seem to somehow be divided over believers in light of Ford's and Kavanaugh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed definitively or probably the Ford statement, while 35 percent said they believed definitively or probably the Ford statement.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought by Ford as well as at least another indictee, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh was drunk when he attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they were at a festival while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor plans to launch a new Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "dominating the world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This may include contact lists, lists of what to do, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the online personal data store unique is that it is entirely up to the user to access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal automation through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company brings resources, process skills and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought by IBM, some staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
By starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down from today to tomorrow.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating a cleric of the Victoria Cross of World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
The Lt-Court The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
Saturday a commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "symbolically brilliant" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Lt Corr led his battleship across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a lot of fog and fire from on-site rifles and machine guns."
Later he rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest courage" drove the line forward before going to a rifle on the spot alone and lost consciousness three of the trump.
The Lt Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get there, but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a girland behind the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to have played a role in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero was being demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of ending with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 packed to end up being denied viewing the main event.
The list from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had remained awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One party member on Twitter described the change to children's cardboard as "some kind of bumpy joke."
"It's a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
Belator chairman Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about the repetition, we probably can fix something," said Coker.
"But right now they're there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
I believe that, when the broadcast was over, there were many messages going on and not all of them were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can assure you that next time it won't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to bring more to supporters and instead we have gone too far.
It is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "lower" due to sexuality
Olympic dive Tom Daley says he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to the secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent he became less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
While he appeared as a detached person on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" others as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "Today, those emotions that you feel less than, and you feel different, were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually get to know about his sexuality.
The bronze Olympic medalist twice became a high-profile promoter for the LGBT and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live freely without ramifications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world's three-time winner said that when he became in love with a man - a U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - he was "surprised" for him.
Daley married Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When he went through so many things at such a young age - he went to his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar beautiful and painful experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, the important thing for me was 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things bigger than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the things he had asked was whether they already had tickets for London in 2012 - as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, already'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that it was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to bend in front of a crowd of countries at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the first selection of his song - Proud of Heather Small - that was compatible with him on the move to the Olympics and still ignited the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Michaelson, who is no longer in the form, remains on the bench at the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a Saturday record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his shape to avoid being an important stage not so happy.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for a 12-time record, remained on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the center of action, as it was often for the United States, the big five-time winner shared his day between supporting and working on his game from a distance in hopes of correcting his concerns.
One who would never give the ball right even in the fullness of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for Le Golf National's difficult track, where the long-distance loosens over and over again punishes wrong stunts.
And if the course alone isn't heartbreaking enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, new to the season, to win all four of their matches.
If the Americans, by four points less than the start of the 12th single game, start well, Mickelson's game can prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, knocked on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of self-confidence.
It's a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two matches.
I've seen more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will jump Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a career of the Ryder Cup which has rather never reached the families of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halfs, though Furyk said his presence brought a few intangible things to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, humorous, likes to laugh at people, and a very good man to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players have enjoyed criticizing him, this week, which was something fun to see.
It provides a lot more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn that the big front position could disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a big lead position ahead of the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros retained a five-point advantage over the Americans but ended with a real narrow margin sprint, with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big front position in Valderrama; we had a big front position in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a little bit," Bjorn said, in the press, after seeing the 2018 Class Golems win 5-3 on Friday and evening.
So the story will show me and everyone in this team that hasn't finished everything yet.
Tomorrow you'll go with your body and soul.
Go out there and do all the good things.
It's not finished until you have scored points on the team.
We have a goal, and what we are trying to hide is this trophy, and the focus remains on it.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what's on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Glad as his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go a step further than me in this.
A different challenge tomorrow.
Tomorrow it concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested for your full ability as a golfer.
This is the message you want to pass to the players, which will bring out your best tomorrow.
Now therefore, leave the partner behind you, and he will leave and bring forth his best, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be seeking his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who gained three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing as Europe did the "Miracle of Medina."
"I remember to the least word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to get to that early start as you saw it at Brookline, as you saw it at Medina.
When it comes to that momentum on one side, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We made our list as appropriate and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we're trying to do a few miracles tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight back and facing Roy McIlroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the best half of the order.
"I went with this group of men this way because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn said about his singles choices.
Germany's new war has been postponed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the oldest frigates of the Cold War, but will not be there until at least next year due to local systems with deficiencies and rising costs.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the flagship of the newly branded baggage ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a spokesman for the military.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problematic issues plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels that ordered the Naval Fleet back in 2007 will come as a replacement for the ageing Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a strong cannon, an anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile display as well as some precautionary technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newest frigates up to two years from home ports.
However, a continuous delay means that the latest-tech ships - allowing Germany to project power offshore - will already be outdated when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 cruise of bad luck appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivering it.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workers on older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the vessel has a well overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice heavier than similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a shocking amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1bn (<0x24>3.6bn) - from initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2bn.
The problems of the newest frigates become especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy currently "has a shortage of ships to withstand deployment."
The official said the problem grew over time, because old ships were commissioned but replacement ships were not provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust refers to the secret life of bats
New ground research in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when looking for food.
It is hoped that the findings will show new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipestrelles and soprano as well as brown bats with long ears and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Riss.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of bat calls and what species is doing.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced which will create a detailed picture of the landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as pasture creation and how best to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and around the United Kingdom has decreased considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development work that affects nests and habitat losses.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, such as poison papers for catching insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The nightmares aren't actually blind.
However, due to their notorious hunting traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated ecological technique to indicate insects and obstacles in their passage when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve in Threave land in Dumfries and Galloway, hosting eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a very good area for bats," he said.
"We have an old building, lots of veterinary trees and the whole good habitat.
But there is much more about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what we need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of checking bats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that unintended destruction of a single maternity nest could kill up to 400 women and youngsters, possibly destroying an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or bother them or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Flea Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for most of our species we still don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers are ready to search for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has cited rape claims against him as "fake news," saying people "should promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are expected to seek in court the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
Portugal's forward player and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was alleged to have paid us <0x24>375,000 at the time for not saying anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on a video on Instagram Live with its 142 million followers hours after claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, remarked the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," Ballon d'Or's winner said five times while staring at the camera.
"We want to promote ourselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They have to become famous to say my name, but this is part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel on the allegations, which they called "inadmissible privacy suspicions reporting," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is likely one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her from the anus, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "a good man" disappointed with "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual intercourse, but that it was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "horrified by retaliation" and was concerned that "it would be humiliated publicly."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now looking to reverse the solution as she is still being traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he walked with Italian football legends Juventus in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK "regrets forever" for losing car manufacturers
The UK "regrets forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Auris and Toyota's Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line today operates on a "exact-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars made in order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border barrier that industry says could lead to delays and shortcomings in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border checks."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that allows, as I say, not only the success to enjoy it at present but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the United union's defendant at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, they never return.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's risky meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's aids and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice from the president.
Whether or not Trump will oust the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has incited Washington's rhetoric for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wire wear to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25 amendments.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, despite reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York, which was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "prefers not to expel Rosenstein" but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a distraction with the Senate judiciary hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave up.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh over a one-week period, which delayed a further full Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "A date has not yet been set for this, it may be this week, and it may be the following week because of all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the press up to date".
Some journalists dispute this assertion: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "trying to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more Questions and Answers sessions compared to any previous president," she added without quoting any evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
The meetings will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions to the U.S. president directly, this is far better than talking to me.
We've tried to do so a lot and we've seen it do so many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump rarely answers questions when leaving the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves relaxedly and sometimes strangely in front of groups of journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and desire to remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter after less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to enter into the cost of defined status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal, which are moving towards decisions expected this autumn, have continued.
But the UK government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of uncertainty for all of you.
That's why I wanted to maintain now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and are beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
"Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie performs emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
"He went on the sideline and like he fell there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical personnel gave the oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before putting him on a streaker and taking him back for further examination.
A Tennessee State Officer told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer being operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "so far there are no details about the type/strength of the injury" and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the university's second year suspended, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after he left Illinois.
Saturday he had a total of five tackles before exiting the game, which led to a total of 18 tackles of his season.
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more stamp tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp tax when buying property in the UK with extra money used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The tax increase will be imposed on non-tax payers in the UK
The Treasury expects it to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - in order to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher stamp tax rate when buying property in the UK - with the extra money being used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-paying people.
The stamp tax increase will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting government efforts to fight street sleep.
The additional fee - which is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purpose purchases - could be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
About 13 percent of newly constructed properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which are increasing prices and making it harder for new buyers to take the first step in the housing purchase phases.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital city - have become "fantastic cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time abroad.
The new policy came out just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping high property prices by seizing land and not using it, and urged Ms May to abandon quotas on affordable homes in order to remedy the "disgraceful situation of housing" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of proposed eye-catching housing reforms, including rent checks and the end of "no fault" dismissals.
He also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Ms May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my post to restoring the UK's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means that we need to fix the market for our home.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and find their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies find it as easy to buy homes as hard-working UK residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too far away, and the dignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland head Jack Ross says his "fundamental ambition" is to one day become Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scottish is facing the challenge of resurrecting the Northeast club, which is currently in third place in League One, with three points difference from that in first place.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for countries as a player.
I got a B-cap and nothing more," Ross told the BBC Sportsound of Scotland.
"When I was a kid, I often went with my dad to see Scotland play in Hampden, and that's always the thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if we succeed in managing a club."
Those who came before Ross as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he is not worried about the fact that he would follow such established names in such a large club, while previously rejecting the offer from the City of Barnsley and Ipswich.
"For now, my success will be based on 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'"
Given the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I probably think I've succeeded here only if I can get the club back there."
Rice only spent three years in his career as manager, after a period as assistant head in Dumbarton and after spending 15 months with Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third category, and transformed St Mirren from the relegation edge to championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he is now feeling more comfortable than he would have felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academics.
Regarding taking Alloa into his hands, he recalled that "this was probably a big change."
"I honestly thought that the manager's position was the most suitable for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange because I was going well, I had a decent life, and I enjoyed some reasonable achievements.
Playing games can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still experiencing this in terms of stress and work pressure but I just feel that the post of manager is suitable for me.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel that throughout my adult life I'm now feeling the most comfortable."

A survey finds that the best time to take a beer pint is at 5.30pm
The summer heatwave has boosted UK pubs' earnings in difficulty but has put more pressure on the same company's restaurants.
In July, groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales - but figures revealed that restaurant earnings fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA of business advisory, who collected the figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a model similar to the previous month of June, when sales in pubs increased even more by 2.8 percent, except for the culinary.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars whose main sales are beverages were the ones that went best in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while restaurant sales declined.
The pubs whose main sale is the food have also suffered in the heat, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
Apparently, people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the pubs and bars handled beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food dropped to three per cent."
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts regarding entertainment and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales in the take-aways market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a fall in sales of 4.8 percent year after year will be particularly heavy in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The hot and long summer could not come at a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and only time can advise us on whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much needed rest."
The growth of total sales in pubs and restaurants, including the opening of start-ups, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of start-ups.
The sales monitoring of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry for the UK pubs, bars and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups, with combined revenues of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents.
A survey reveals that one in five children - some at the young age of 11 - have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "False Insta" pages
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "key" account to show their parents
One in five children - some at the young age of 11 - are creating social media accounts hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "Insta fake" accounts - a reference to the site for sharing Instagram photos.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a "main" account presentable to show their parents, while having others private.
A mother who met her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a young woman who was urging others to rape her - "suppress me."
Research, from Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half admitting to holding private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will become the "Voice for Athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most racetrack and non-course athlete who most won medals and president Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from its vast experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as a voice for athletes and I hope to be able to truly contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic gold medals and who is now a regular BBC critic, ended up out of action after suffering a minor stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "It's like a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time can advise us whether or not I recover or to what extent.
It was a beat job but I fully recovered, learned how to dry again and today I am doing agility exercises!
"Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers to cattle gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different opinions online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows being suckled.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be "the world's first wearable and noise-free breast pump", consumer tech company Elvie has released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to showcase the freedom the new pump gives the mom.
Four real mothers dance in a dungeon filled with cow straw with a disc that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I'm milking myself but I don't have a tail" and "In case I didn't realize these aren't bumps but breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump out, pump out, I'm hoping for my babies, pump out, pump out, I'm milking my women."
However, the ad that was published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 spectators and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of whom say it sheds light on the "terror" of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision that cows were used to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their babies are taken within a few days of giving birth".

Another commented: "One understands that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who hold their babies?"
Someone else added, "Republicanism is really cut off from reality."
Others defended the ad, with a woman admitting that she found the disc "very entertaining."
"I think this is a genius idea.
If I'd still had one, I'd buy one.
I felt the same way I felt like a cow.
It's more or less a snapshot, but I've got it.
This is a generic product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often on their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women reveal that they were all dancing with non-eye pumps placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and sits in a breastfeeding bra without giving in the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD in Mother commented: "Elvie Pump is a product so revolutionary that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the women who use the breast pump with the dairy cows we wanted to pay attention to the pumping of the breasts and all the challenges it brings, while demonstrating in a fun and reconnected way, the incredible sense of freedom that will bring it.
This isn't the first time that the Ellie Pump has appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children walk without words to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply despite the fact that the monthly border crossing has remained unchanged, partly because rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and were afraid that if they presented themselves to take care of a child would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
Risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their poultry would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of a sponsor's home are here in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
That's why we continue to look for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days later, which was the previous standard, according to the shelter workers.
Many will appear through a video telephony conference, rather than in person, in order to bring arguments in favour of their case to legal status to an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and the reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the more children are held in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or distressed, which can lead to violent expressions or attempts to escape.
Lawyers have said that this concern increases in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is finding it difficult to ignore are more likely, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or without telling their peers strength could lead to trauma that many of them are already fighting.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupying forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory, with the excuse of fighting terrorism, and "will be addressed as appropriate."
"They should withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism is nearly over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we expel all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, many of which train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return, and blamed "in some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that led the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last strong major rebels has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
However Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Be Winning the Second Mandate
With this logic, Mr Trump will win the re-election in 2020 as long as, as many liberal viewers hope, the denunciation and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
It's definitely the "most dramatic finale ever in the presidency!"
So far, it seems that the viewers are not satisfied.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" has increased cable television's lead ratings with even 3.5 million viewers on nights.
"This is a situation that is attracting people to it because it is not something we understand," said Neal Baer, a presenter of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Why do you bother me,' said Mrs. Scovell.
In this chaos there is a value of entertainment.
Undoubtedly, unlike anything else on TV, Washington's storyline titles can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant families can rejoin and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring what's happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the six following a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of a "deep background" source for his book "Fear," the Bomber jacket by Paul's <0x24>1stick-sleeve ("reflecting shirts").
For example, I'm never going to look at Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what he's doing making it as if it's a reality show is that every night he's delivering something to you," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars".
You can't afford to lose one episode because otherwise it will fall back.
When I contacted Mr Fleiss this week, outside his house the weather was sunny at 80 degrees on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not have arisen in front of television, not when there was Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when before we were doing those exciting programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr Fleiss said to me.
"I thought it was a joke, but in fact they were right."

Large amounts of money coming from abroad for the most stringent races in the midterm election of the White House
It is no surprise that the seventeenth congressional district of Pennsylvania is seeing a large amount of money, thanks to the re-alignement of congressional districts that have acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
It has recently re-established the pits of Pittsburgh suburban district Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is emerging as a candidate against another operator, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the twelfth old Pennsylvania district, which extends heavily over the seventeenth new district.
The maps were re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally tampered with in favour of Republicans.
The race in the new seventeenth district resulted in a difficult financial campaign competition between the arms of the main party's finances, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) (Congress Committee of the Democratic Republic) and the National Republican Campaign (National Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning with little difference in the March special election followed heavily for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat was of a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political critics gave the Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. decided to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, and then decided not to do so.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held a welcoming meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and held a hotel in Panama until some partners fired the Trump Organization's administrative team.
State Department officials have decided to re-contact the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said the department's spokesperson Heather Nauert in a statement.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received around <0x24>140 million in American aid, including narcotic controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been a burden for the Central American country and its high unemployment and killing rates.
As internal meetings began to progress, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with the aim of effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been strongly criticized for addressing the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration puts on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three Americans sent back quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were backed up by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
A study of history
The next unexpected negative event could be the report by special adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
Mr Mueller is also reportedly turning his investigation on whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that Congress passes to another person, Mr Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares to go back to the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainty, and I do not intend to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalent in Europe.
There are choices to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of mass murder that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of inflection, and the inexorable path of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today, Americans face many of these points of inflection.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and speculated that it is not suitable for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein said that The Times' report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I.'s newly requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual conduct and dishonest witnesses?
And above all, in the middle of the terms we will vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, it will take a long time to move into democracy.
But I don't think we will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the house of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship of God, she sent me to light the candles on that swastika table.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, recognizing that the victory against the Austrians, following the equally impressive result they brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
Knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until an equal 2-2 result with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us as Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could achieve something and came out with a point.
We could probably have won it towards the end but, overall, an equal result was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
The next day will be a great European night.
We hope we can get three points but this will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can continue to do our best and achieve a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there is still a sense of positivity at the moment.
The team is good and the boys are having a lot of fun; the training is being good.
I hope that we can do our best, forget the last season and succeed."
Women are concerned about this fear related to retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wished to be supervised, few people were talking to their family members about this.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be a family member to care for them, but they are not taking steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
You should start with that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't express your wishes well ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a hybrid money value in order to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own good - provided you have the money.
Make a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long run: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare provider in order to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a proxy for your finances.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the finances that are involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Make sure that the plan is ready."
A man has been shot several times by an air rifle in Ifracombe
A man was shot several times by an air rifle as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, aged over 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfracombe, Devon, when he was hit by bullets in his chest, abdomen and hands.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not a threat to his life and police have appealed to witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
With faults in communication lines, aid officers were unable to obtain any information from Donggala's reaction, which is an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake epicenter at a magnitude of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a reference spanning more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regression, an administrative region under a province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mine is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is situated on the Sismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province Aceh north of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds have died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast with a great force, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, beyond Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low earthquake hit the incidence of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and fatal tsunami.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 were killed because of a building that crashed.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wassilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her hand.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured <0x24>500 bond, the CTU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "certainly, not guilty" when asked to give his motive, the network reported.
Palin is facing three class A crimes, meaning he can be jailed for up to a year and has to pay a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a class B crime, which is punishable by a day's imprisonment and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with an attack on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with a domestic attack, interfering in the domestic violence crime report, and holding a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His wife claimed that she had been stabbed in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by the veteran groups after a comparison was made between her son's violent behavior and the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just a little outside the center of Sulawesi located in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on the media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are demanding that suspect of NYC terrorist attack be given a rare death penalty
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, be given the death penalty - a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck of Home Depot to carry out a bicycle attack along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, barricading pedestrians and cyclists who crashed on his way in October.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intent to claim the death penalty, filed in the South New York District.
According to the court document, these two indictments carry with them a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury gave Saipov 22 chiefs of charge that included eight murder charges with the help of organised relapse, typically used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Describing the way Saipov carried out this attack "cruel, cruel and immoral", prosecutors said the attack required "substantial planning and premeditation."
The notice of intent states that "Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Parogle Erolij, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Dinadogo".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last sued a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbekistan national, has shown a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he inspired himself to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the head of the charge.
He also requested that an ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He did not respond guilty to the 22 heads of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "definitely disappointed" with the prosecution decision.
"We think that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of accepting a ground of guilt for life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
MP Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at Tory's conference, Nigel Farage promised that he would "mobilize the army of the people."
Former Ukip chief said politicians had to "feel under pressure" from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party government member Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that so far the UK "would have come out" if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge faced by Ms May to reconcile her deeply divided positions has been underlined by non-Brexit-friendly Tories who joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers' compromise plan on the right track amid attacks by Brexiters, anti-Brexit and the EU.
Allies have insisted that despite the negative reaction it will continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - and force Eurosceptics and the Labour party to choose between its package and "chaos".
Mr Bone told the rally Leave Means Leave in Sulihull that he wanted "to set aside Chequers' plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given a high social position and should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have been out," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will defend Brexit but we need to reject the Chequers' plan."
When he declared that he was against the EU, he said: "We are not fighting world wars to serve.
We have to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain is not absolutely true."
Andrea Jenkyns, Tory's Brexiteer, was also present for the demonstration, telling reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers' plan is unpopular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, unpopular with our party and with our activists who are actually the ones going on the streets and who are primarily voting for us.
Please forget the plans of the Chequers and start listening."
In a message aimed at Ms May, she said: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel under pressure" if they were to go back from the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to go back from Brexit and we're here today to tell them that 'we won't let you smooth if you do that'."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from Brexit.
We are mobilizing in Brexit the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and we will not waste until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud UK."
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit activists marched in Birmingham before making a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Following the group's launch this weekend, a small number of activists branded banners writing Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit).
Lord Adonis, who holds a high social position in the Labour party, made fun of the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with the party's app as it opened the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full-fledged.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "carefully examine" the possibility to emerge for the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections it will "carefully examine the possibility to emerge for the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday Massachusetts Democratic Party member talked about her future in a debate with citizens at a municipal level in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will come out for re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that Trump could succeed in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Hollyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at a municipal level since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked her if she intended to go to the presidential election.
Warren responded that it was time "that women go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest in connection with the shooting of LSU Sims
Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU's Wayde Sims basketball player that occurred Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
On Friday they released a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify the man shown in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the University of Southern campus on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, Saturday police chief Murphy J. Paul told media "Wayde Sims suffered from a headshot wound and eventually died as a result."
Wayde came to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson asked him questions and admitted that he was on the scene, that he had a weapon, and admitted to shooting on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and held in custody at the East Parish Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a six-foot young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes to the world title after his team's orders gave him victory against Sebastian Vettel
Saturday, from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play an important part in the race.
From the inside position in the first row, Bottas had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his friend.
Vettel was the first to enter the stop areas and let Hamilton slide with the others in the group's last place, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the stop zone after another lap and came out just after Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a few wheel action with a wheel which led to the Ferrari driver leaving the interior with difficulty free due to the risk of a retraction after a double shift.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the grid and was in seventh place until the end of his first turn in his birthday at the age of 21.
Then he was ahead for most of the race by not changing his tires with the aim of finishing quickly and jumping Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
Eventually he entered the stop zone in the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen entered the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his job very well throughout the weekend and was a true gentlem saying let me by.
The team did a really exceptional job to get first and second place," said Hamilton.
What Is A Really Bad Physical Attitude
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she did not disclose the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that the people were "vicious and disgusting and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are arrogant and vil, nasty and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclosures and then say 'no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal any information?
Remember her answer... I revealed the document - "e, e, what is it?
You don't see.
I didn't reveal anything."
Look, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't," he said, adding that he had to go to the police station.
Feinstein you sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and this was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure was coming from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, reporting The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her confidential and I kept her confidential as she asked."
But it seems that her denial was not well received by the president, who, during Saturday evening's rally commented: "You know what I see, that was a really bad physical attitude.
It may not have been revealed, but that's the worst physical attitude I've ever seen."
While continuing his defence of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You're seeing vultures, disgusts, they don't care who hurts, who makes sticks in the wheels to get power and control," the president said according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made a pact for Friday's Elite League defeat against Belfast Giants by winning the match against the same opponent 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants gained an advantage of two goals early in the game with two attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the same score for the team playing in his home country before Dwyer regained an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored the same for Dundee before two Lucas Lundvald Nielsen goals confirmed their victory.
It was the third win of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who after several losses advanced to win Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams met, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's first goal took place in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a move by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the move while Beauvillier doubled the advantage four minutes later.
In what was an opening period with a lot of action, Sullivan brought the playing team home back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave a move to Cownie at 15:16 bringing the same score for both teams.
Dwyer ensured that Giants would gain an advantage up to the game's first break when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The team that is playing in his home country rejoined and again thanks to Bouchard they reached the other team with a strong goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee an advantage for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured his fifth goal win for his team in the middle of the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure That Hundreds of People On The Airplane Can Escape From Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being considered a hero after he died to ensure a plane carrying hundreds of people safely lands.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continued to dominate the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower he was shaking at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained calm in order to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which at the time was in the runway, could safely depart.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was being torn apart.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, ABC News of Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we hear about this, we feel very sad," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under fragmentation while many could not be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance inserts the body.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia are working tirelessly to help those who are still alive but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Ready?" reported the CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after plane crash in the lake
The airline that was operating a flight that hit the Pacific lake in Micronesia now says a man is missing, after saying earlier that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated from the drowning plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, she was unable to give details of where one man's passenger was.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lake a short distance from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to pass through the water that was high to their waist until the emergency exit on the drowning plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that seafarers who were working nearby to improve a reef also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank at about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the past two decades 111 people have died in airline accidents registered with PNG but no incident involved Air Niugini.
An Analyst presents a timetable for the evening in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new trial of a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014 while she was alive.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as expert testimony in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described for the jury how he used the mobile records to combine information about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicts his earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the mobile data showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city at that time.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said he was "being lying, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellys said he had known Chambers for two weeks when he died.
The mobile records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, phone calls and contact information from his mobile phone.
"He lost his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to pass to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Three hip-hop artists want to challenge the negative perspective of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, by Bristol, claim that the hip-hop has gone beyond its origins of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make the popular conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common saw a recent revival in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny from NY sues a couple for dismissing her after a "racist" message
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from the mother who was complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denies being racist, comparing the cause to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed regret when she learned that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was a dark carnival when she came to the first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEE OTHER PERSON," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her heavy mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and expelled Ms. Maurice, saying that her predecessor, an African-American, did not do her job well and that she was instead waiting for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one working day and was then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation in connection with the dismissal, and is claiming <0x24>350 a day for the six-month live-in position for which she had been initially employed, despite being without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do such things," she told Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the claims that they were racist, saying that Mrs Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife gave me something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist people," Joel Plasco told Post.
"But would you trust your children in the hands of someone who talked to you with a guff, even if that was an error?"
Your baby's birth?
And let's come."
Comparing the case to "extortion", Plasco said that it had only been two months since his wife had given birth and was in "a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to blame someone like that?"
It's not a good thing to do," added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly announced the couple on social media, insulting them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoe reading it for the first time before it was published.
"It's really fun to now know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book from a small toy bear, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that his 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "pleasantly, but somewhat sloppy" after his death.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success though he never stopped talking about him.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't full of himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child to get something: be proud of them even if you weren't you having got something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he always gave the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her my last call on the phone.
Her daughter was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked to save her life but it was all in vain.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, which was not expected to live," Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to give her my last greeting.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart beat were slowing down and leaving her system slow.
She had died a little while before and she began to wreak havoc.
All I could do was sit down and wait, aware that all this is happening.
I couldn't stop crying or crying because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it back."
Eventually Ms Ednan-Laperouse, who was crying so far for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a low rashi, and tears began to flow all the time.
It's hard to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
He needed my love and I needed it.
I knew how much he loved her."
Post cards of distressed women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking off their own hands.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been affixing cards on Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Ms. Davis's son, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
He always said that his smile would ignite every room."
However, he had to quit work before he died, because he was in "a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am always afraid that this will be the cause of another ugly event."
Ms. Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people you can open your heart to or meet, even as a friend.
Don't put in silence - you need to speak."
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend for years with Mrs Davies, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, not too long after his mother's death.
"He wasn't saying he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad - when the children opened their gifts he did not make any contact with them with his eyes or anything like that."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they want to fight her: "Leave a void in the family.
Separation.
But we all need to continue our lives and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in a precarious situation as the FBI begins an investigation
"I said, if we could achieve something like what he asked - a time-limited investigation, limited in scope - perhaps we would have brought some unity," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "shocking" among a partisan paralysis that raised him.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due entirely to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans are not going well, in that case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was picking up the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through which he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
Voting will take place in the Senate, where they currently occupy a 51-Republican and 49-Democrat position.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The number of desers in North Korea "decreases" under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters for South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Citing data from the South Side unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug, said last year there were 1,127 changes in the party - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates that human smugglers were demanding were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of deserters from the North Side are actually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Many of them flee by passing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the highly protected Demilitarized Area (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them home forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were focused on stalling the denuclearisation negotiations.
This comes after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress made since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, by no means will we be the first to unilaterally withdraw arms," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "stereotypical," saying he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi called the person nominated for Supreme Court Mr Brett Kavanaugh "stereotypical" and said he was unable to work in Supreme Court due to his temperamental behavior.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't imagine the fact that if a woman had ever behaved that way, they would have said 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and suffocating when he was talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "an assassination of the grossska and coordinated character" organised by the angry liberals that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's witnesses have proven that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he has shown that he has prejudices against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi came up when asked whether she would try to charge Kavanaugh if confirmed, and whether the Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say something -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, so he is not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in the court he is currently in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal of D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, being considered conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's inappropriate for a person with hysterical prejudices to go to court and wait to say, 'Very well,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise their authority.
It's a fair verbal attack, months and years of anger, and she can't say what she has to say without crying.
"We're crying when we're raping," said Mrs Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is rare, what do you say?"
She added, "I was helped by a lot of a woman who had been caught up somewhere else, who said that even she was crying when she was chanted, but developed a technique that meant that when she was whispering and crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, 'Probably you're thinking she's upset because I'm crying.
I'm diagnosed."
And then it didn't stop.
And I thought it was a brilliant thing."
Crying is allowed as a way to get out of one's great anger in part because fundamentally they are misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where one day I found myself crying with an indescribable rage, was when an older woman caught me by the bunch of my neck - a cold manager that I was always afraid of - and carried me towards.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're being bullied.
They think you're upset and they feel happy that they've succeeded in hurting you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was due to go to the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart got caught in an extramarital relationship on a boat known as Monkey Business and emerged from the election, Ms. Schroeder, widely lied, concluded that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of coming out herself for the presidential election.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who were going to stand for the election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Nans."
As this was at the end of the campaign, she was behind in raising funds, so she vowed that she would not go out to the election if she did not make <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who were giving <0x24>1,000 to her men were giving her only <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'm getting some discount?" she said.
When she made her speech announcing that she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - grateful to the people who supported her, lied about the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters instead of delegates, and articulated about sexism - which he turned upside down.
"Perhaps I thought I had a strong brake these," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the way the media reacted to her.
"I thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I'm wondering, what's on my list?

How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The numbers of air bombs of the opening of the U.S.-China trade war have alarmed you, and while the battle remains to end, misunderstandings between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), and effectively taxing all goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing has been retaliated each time in the same way, while more recently it has been presenting tariffs of five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to agree with the United States every time, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will surrender in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step back means it accepts the demands, but publicly the fact that China surrenders to the United States will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, U.S. trade war pressures can positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to start economic chaos in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what spectators have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia at the New American Security Center, which is a sequel (Center for New Americans).
Syria is "completely ready" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime welcomed assistance in rebuilding the country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the sedition.
Europe embraces the victory of the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points it needed to win the United States.
Phil Mickelson, who is prominent in the United States, who struggled throughout the whole tournament, gave his coup tie in the water in the 16th pair-3 holes, thereby ceding his game to Francesco Molinari.
Molinary Italian golfer has stood out in all of its rounds, becoming 1 in 4 players who have ever brought 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5<0x26>4 against the lowest level player on the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's top-level player, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the best European tournament player to have been here with 25.5 points throughout his career.
"Normally I didn't cry, but today I couldn't keep it.
It was a difficult year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that I got the cup back.
The team is everything, and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia emotionally after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compact partner John Ram who has won the legend of the United States golf legend Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in singles play Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, that I won Tiger Woods, when I was raised to follow him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of Ryder Cup 13-21-3 throughout his career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players ever, who won 14 main titles, second only after Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled the entire weekend to find those parts of the golf course with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
There was a time when we had some pressure on Europe.
We have argued.
To Thomas, the chapel is removed.
He is a very good master.
His 12 players played very well.
We will rejoin, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You'll have to grab the hat and bend your head.
Play better than it."
