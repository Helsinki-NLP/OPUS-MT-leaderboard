The statement, which was made by the Chairman of the Inspector-General Muhammad Jibril and Secretary-General of the Bari Muhammed Liman, has said in the last six years that the party has ruled for the state, N512 million alone.
The statement further said the meeting called on stakeholders, who led her to the last weekend, will help to continue to bring controversial gatherings in the party, saying they have written the secretary of the National Party for the development of events in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "We understand the Governor of Niger State's efforts to distribute the freedom of the party through organizing a stakeholder's stakeholders, for any complaint against the party's leadership, written on the party's secretary of the party's secretariat, in order to investigate them."
According to him, in the six years since the establishment of the party, N512 million is in the party.
He said that what he understood as the governor was part of the national committee set up on July 25, 2020, led by the president to guide the leadership of the problems between the opposition parties and withdrawal of complaints among the members of the party.
"What we paid to pay for the salaries of the Secretary of State, and other activities related to party policies, party policies, and other challenges to fix some of the healthcare challenges as a lack of support for government support, we are not a party party party, we are challenged to all of us.

Therefore, stakeholders of the party have no particular role in the process, especially if they try to react to the commission and so their decision is not necessarily invalid.
This is why they are in good condition in the state in the 21st chapter and paragraph of 87 of the Constitution of the Constitution.
Because the decisions made by the leaders are wrong.
He said that those presented with a controversial meeting at the non-governmental event, which was not implicated by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, and General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Domingoli, Alhaji Ibrahim Barbela and all the board members, not members of the committee of the party's party.
The Chairman of the Chairman of the party's Chairman of the party, Mohammed Imam is the only one that will not lead the leadership of the party.

In other words, the Igbos have been reluctant to respond to the comments.
He and his brother, President Buhari, and his brother-in-law, were in a position to take the lead, and he said that he would not be allowed to do so in 2023.

On the other hand, if he attempts to breach the PREMIUM TIMES and computer, he also recovered another attack on his GSM phone.
He spent five days on the open door to the Great PREMIUM TIMES, but was unsuccessful, even though he used the modern technology.

It doesn't matter if the PREMIUMME has already been administered by a large number of cybersecurity and high-risk cyclists that are taking place in the world.
This lack of knowledge makes it possible for all of the materials to be used, the same as the old ones that can't afford to do with PREMIUM TIMES any harm or damage.
On this day, he suffered exhausted fatigue and tired fatigue because he followed the attack by DDOS in the NTP Limited, which was the oldest method used in Kano since the village was abandoned.
On March 3rd, he made all the techniques in his brain, but he didn't succeed.

In the Longyuan Region of Hongsipu, Wuzong, Ningxia, a Hui autonomous Hui people, located in the northwest China region of China.
Li Yomeiei or Sadiya (also known as her Islamic name) was famous for her struggles in life and her successes based on her efforts to get out of poverty.
The story tells us that the effort and the effort to seek, is a matter of self-confidence.
Initially, Li Li Yaoom or Sadiya, she had never lived in a class with the aim to take a lesson, why she couldn't read a novel.
Rather, God has given wisdom to the wise, wisdom, insight, and wisdom, so as to be an example in the field of war and wisdom.
Over the past 20 years, Madama Li Yaomei, has suffered from diabetes, leading to surgery, including three times.
After her recovery, she saw a tremendous accident, and now she's walking with a metal that is placed in her legs.
These challenges faced her through difficult situations of health, even the issue of medicine, why she received about 3,000 yuan, an equivalent to over N16 million.
It's surprising that this is a challenge to a woman who is trying to find a way to improve her life.
In addition, the government's support for the Chinese government was increasingly disappointed.
Self-promotion is the practice of diversity based on the use of vegetation.
Because of her efforts, her father's work has been very busy, where different types of work are provided.
In addition, she has created a number of engineering machines that help her to make the job easier.
For example, she took 15 minutes to connect a larger one, but now in this time, it will connect 5 pills.
In addition, she has also provided some additional cleaning machines that are reservoirs.
There's also an additional cheap machine that feeds women's nutrients, and it's still selling these machines for applicants.
Considering the challenges of Saudi Arabia, and the efforts she's still trying to improve the quality of her life and of her employees, it will be understood that the applicant's applicant is getting with it.
The fight against poverty and improving life is not an issue for the government.
If the government is willing to provide support, but people are not willing or impressed to improve their lives by doing their jobs according to their own actions, then the only progress can be done without achieving any goal.
The story indicates that conducting a professional career or income does not require a certain amount of money or travel or travel to other cities or abroad.
Because she's the one who's in her life, she's using the resources to improve her life.
In addition, Sadiya managed these activities to stand on foot without relying on her husband's husband, because he ran away from her.
In other words, self-sacrifice and self-confidence are the things that are in the heart.
He showed the courage of the women who had to change their lives and make their own way without looking for someone else's help.
It's also a lesson that every person has to do with the ability to make sure that it is safe to trust someone else.
Sadiya was a well-known, intelligent, smart and self-esteem that is an example of learning to others.
Also, in March, Saudi Arabia has completed the payment of all debts, and has also suspended subsidy from the government on its own.

Although the concept of the U.S. government is well understood, the presence of the United States is the most advanced in the spread of the virus, but other developing countries also need vaccines, considering that they are more likely to have a few healthcare resources.
The magazine "The Ecologist" also pointed out that if the United States achieved the goal of vaccinating vaccines to produce, the number of vaccines in developing countries would be reduced.
The executive director of the African CDC Mr. John Nngafensong pandemic, has also expressed concern over this issue.
As some commentators on the daily issues appear, even if a vaccine is successful, it is not possible to achieve the goal of seeing the disease after the pandemic, which is designed to separate vaccines, which is an important factor for the international community.
It is important for the international community to strengthen the unity of
The WHO director-general director of the WHO Tedros also pointed out that if the outbreak of the pandemic, it must be detected from all aspects of the world, it is possible that some parts of the world, or other countries will be able to achieve the success of the epidemic alone.
