The Welsh Parliamentary Representatives (AM) are anxious to ‘ look like puppets ’
There is a certain concern of some parliamentary delegates regarding the conversion of their titles to the MWP (Russian Congressman of Wales).
The issue surfaced by plans to rename Congress to the Welsh Parliament.
The congressional parliamentes on the Hall of Anxiety may be the issue that raises the dissident public opinion.
A Labor Party delegate said that his party was worried that "the word would rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For non - Welsh readers it is: In Wales, twp is temporary and pwp means shit.
A delegation of Stripters raised that the whole party "not proud" and proposed other names.
A Conservative Party delegate shares his party "no prejudice" about renamed, but does not forget to mention how easily MWP stands as Muppet (the puppet).
In terms of the Welsh word w is pronounced similar to that of the British Yorkshire u.
The Congressional Committee currently drafts the bill regarding renamed, suggesting: "The final decision to any identification of the parliamentary delegates would naturally be of interest to the delegates themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act empowered the Welsh Parliament to rename itself.
In June, the committee released the results of a referendum on proposals intended to find a constituency facility for the name of Parliament as the Welsh Parliament.
In view of the title story of the parliamentary delegates, the Committee is open to the Welsh parliamentary or WMP decision, but the results of the referendum show the parliamentary trend of the Welsh Parliament.
The parliamentary delegates are publicly offering other options, but efforts to achieve consensus may be a concern to the Chief of Elen Jones, who is commissioned to submit to the revision bill in the next few weeks.
The draft of the amendment bill will include other changes in the way Congress operates, including the rules of disparity to the Congressional Congress and the design of the administration.
The congressionals will give the final vote to the question of what they should be renamed as when they offer comments on the draft of the amendment bill.
The people of Macedonia voted in the referendum on the change of the country's name
The voters went to vote on Sunday about whether they would change the country's name to "The Northern Macedonia Peace".
Complete voting was established in an attempt to resolve the decades-long dispute with the neighboring Greek country, which also had a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of the northern neighboring country corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed the membership of EU and NATO of your country.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the opposition party for the change of the country's name, has announced that he will repeal the vote results.
However, the party advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, considered the change of the state to be the main cost of joining EU and NATO.
The St. Martin's Church Bell fell into silence when the crisis broke out in Harlem.
"Stort in historical terms, the older men I've been exposed to share that every corner has a bar and a church," said Adams.
"To this day, there is no church and no bar."
He found that the disappearance of bars was acceptable.
He said that today "People have a lot of ways to communicate."
"The bars are no longer public living rooms where people frequent".
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from the sale of assets would not be as sustainable as the leaders expected "and sooner or later all will be back at the starting line."
He added that these churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with many of the locals' apartments, which would not be of any help in maintaining local dignity.
He added, "A small part of the people who buy apartments in those apartment buildings will be white people, and then the prospect of closed churches coming as fast as ever because there's no reason why the residents in those apartments will become its members."
Both churches were built by the white congregations before Harlem became a black city - the Tribune in the 1870s, becoming St. Martin's a decade later.
The first White Methodists moved away in the 1930s.
A nearby congregation of black worshipers took over the site.
St. Martin's was taken over by a colored congregation under the administration of priest John Howard Johnson, who headed a decomposing of retailers on 125th Street, a shopping mall street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or urging the colored people.
A 1939 fire caused the building to be badly damaged, but when Father Johnson's parish had planned to rebuild, they had set the bell.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor at St. Martin's, proud to call the bell set "the bell of the poor".
"A Cultural Museum" and "a Intelligent Historical Treasure" was the courtesy of the July Beller.
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first bell set played by a colored musician, Dariosio A. Lind, who pursued the larger bell set at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's was not replacing him.
What happened at St. Martin's in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some given by the parish leaders in the church, others by the Episcopal parish.
Legislative management - the parish's administration, consisting of the parish leaders - referred to the parish in July with concerns that the parish "will seek to transfer costs" to the department of the parish, although they are not involved in hiring the architects and contractors have been mentioned.
Some of the laity are not pleased with the lack of transparency in the parish.
Sharks attacked a 13-year-old seaman catching lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy as he went diving for lobster in California last Saturday, on the first day of the shrimp harvest, the authorities told him.
The incident occurred before 7:00 a.m., just off Beacon's coast at Encinias.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was driving with his friends for about half an hour that Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then all of them swimming out of the country.
Hammel shared that he initially claimed that it was only a pleasant scream when he caught the shrimp, but then he "recognised that the boy was crying, ‘I got bit!
I got bit!"
The whole part of the boy's collarbone was exposed," Hammel noticed as soon as he got to the boy.
"I tell people to get out of the water right now: 'There's sharks there!' Hammel shared more.
He was flown by plane to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was in insurance, in critical condition.
The name of the shark is the perpetrator in the unidentified attack.
Rescue workers, Captain Larry Giles shared in a media press conference that they discovered a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but they determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles further mentioned that the victim suffered severe injuries at his upper body.
Officials have closed beach entrances from the Ponto coastal direction in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas within 48 hours serving the purpose of investigation and safety.
Giles reveals that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not in danger.
Structured into the beauty market in Sainsbury's UK
Sainsbury's pushing further for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the beautiful stalls in the traditional display style, where there is always help specialists.
As part of the massive impulse to the 2.8 billion dollar beauty market, which is continuing to grow while the sales of fashion and household goods have declined, the larger beauty shops will be tested at 11 stores across the country and then is scaled to the test at more stores in the next year if there are significant signs.
The investment in the beauty-making industry appeared when supermarkets sought to make the best use of the substitute stalls for TV counters, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's said that for the first time they doubled the scale of their beauty products up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Available brand sequences such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have extra space and store-selling areas similar to the display in stores such as at Boots.
The supermarket is also reinvigorating its Bouvique make-up line so that most of the products are pure plant - which is increasingly hunted by young customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop retailer will test the sale at two Sainsbury's, the first store opened at Croydon, south of London, last week and the second store opened at Slylie Oak, Bristol, at the end of this year.
The online shopping and turning to buying a small amount of daily food at local convenience stores meant that the supermarkets had to put more of their heart into attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, said that the stalls would be more and more similar to the department stores as the supermarket series attempted to confront the favours from Aldi and Lidl with more services and more non-food items.
Sainsbury's, which has brought Argos' stalls into hundreds of stores and has also introduced some Habitats counters since they bought both brand chain two years ago, this prompted the grocery sales and helped buy more profitable.
The supermarket had previously tried to raise its beauty and pharmaceuticals but failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after there was a problem involving how to divide sales from the goods stalls in the supermarkets.
The new strategy was given after Sainsbury's sale of 271 of his pharmaceuticals to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds drug chain, for £25 million three years ago.
Known Lloyds would contribute a part of the plan, by increasing a series of luxury leather care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Director of Commerce of Sainsbury's Shared: "We've changed the appearance and feel of the beautiful sequences to raise the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specialized training for staff, who will be offering advice directly.
A series of our brands are designed to fit every need and attractive environment as well as convenient venues that mean that we are now a attractive stop, challenging the traditional way of buying."
Peter Jones ‘branched his wrath" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a contract worth £11 million.
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, was "wrathing" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a $11 million contract in his style franchise business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby didn't have time for their interior brand and Truly accessory.
The couple's business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
Leading the 37-year-old show of this Morning went to Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den, making the star Peter Jones furious as she withdrew from their super-profit brandship operation at the last minute—to focus on her own new fat contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
In a tension meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources say Jones had "disputed" when the show's golden girl admitted that her new contracts - worth up to £5.5 million - meaning that she did not have enough time to devote herself to their interior brand and Truly accessory.
The business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is said to double Willow's £11 million.
When the 37-year-old star Willoughby went to Instagram to announce that she would leave Truly, Jones quickly left England to go to one of his motels.
One source said: "At this time, Truly is Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would be with you in the next few decades.
Her decision to leave amazed the people involved.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, the time was very close to the debut.
There's a warehouse filled with goods at Marlow headquarters that's ready to be released."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning program's host, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions of dollars due to heavy investment in products from cushions and candles to clothes and furniture, and the ability to step back at the time of the product's release.
And that could be the end of a lasting friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby children and her husband Dan Baldwin became close with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple were on vacation together and Jones had 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the franchise Ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin to become the host of ITV as I'm A Celebrity.
A close source with Jones shared last night that "we will not comment on his business issues."
It's just that we're so much in love.
He joked about the criticisms he would receive from the media channels for making a comment that some would consider "not to be a ruler" for having seen the good side of the Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Mr Trump speaks in a re-imposed voice "the host of the show".
"I'm not giving up on anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when Trump praised this as a major step forward in non-specialization in Korea.
But non-spectacular negotiations have been discontinued.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of the Korean Department of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that Korea did not notice the "satisfactory response" from the United States to the first disarmament movements of North Korea.
Instead, he claimed, the United States is continuing sanctions to increase pressure.
Mr Trump had a much more optimistic look in his speech at the campaign.
"We're doing good with Korea," he said.
"We're going to make war with Korea.
Millions of people could be killed.
We're in this good relationship now."
He said that efforts to improve the relationship with Kim had a positive result - the closure of rocket tests, helping the hostage be free and bringing the bones of American soldiers back home.
And he defended his unusual approach when it came to his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get in this tight area, we have about 200 people standing right there," said Trump, heading into the crowd right in front of us.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia destroys the entire island and kills hundreds of people.
For example, following the disaster from the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs indicated that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has gone missing, there is no statement of national disaster given, a preservative condition for shoveling for international aid.
"It's unfortunate, in many cases, they've been very determined not to ask for international aid, so that's very challenging." Mrs Sumbung shared.
While Save the Children are gathering a group to move to Palu, they are not sure whether foreign employees can work in this area.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, stated that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies are allowed to contribute aid efforts.
Despite the continuing earthquake conditions that Indonesia experiences, the country has not yet been well prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, such places were not popular at other locations.
Despite the effective warning, the lack of tsunami sirens in Palu has the potential to lead to human damage.
At peak times, moving between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Disasters make post-commission even more complicated.
An ambulance has been recorded in Lombok to treat earthquake victims who are on their way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo turned the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure into a centre of his election campaign and he squandered the funds on the construction of land roads and railroads.
But the financial shortage made it difficult for Mr. Joko's administration when he faced the re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from the tensions between denominations that have not yet ended in Indonesia, when members of the majority of Muslims pursue a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people drifted away from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed on the streets, using knives, bows, and other crude weapons.

The Cromwell of Parliament becomes the latest monument to the story 'Rewritten History'.
The elimination would be like a poem of justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many Qingsmen who followed him, when they destroyed the multitude of British architectural and religious structures.
But the Cromwell Association describes Mr. Crick's words as "small" and "the power to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Association, stated: "It is inevitable to argue about leaving the figures of Oliver Cromwell outside the Bristol Palace that will become the focus of the day.
The symbol of the British Civil Wars was not issued or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be replaced because of the actions of his father Thomas in the previous century.
Representative Cromwell, Sir William Hamo Thassycroft is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and is part of the history of a character that many believe still to be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith shares with the Sunday Telegraph: Mr. Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: "It is possible that by the end of the 19th century more than now, Cromwell is considered by many to be the defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his mind, of course, the monarchy.
Even if it's a perfectly accurate example for the subject in the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict between the 17th century shaped the next development of our country and Cromwell as a typical character in divisions.
His achievements as the Protector of God are also worthy of honor and note."
China's People's Farmers Attack the People's Death Vong
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a southwestern market in China, according to the news from local media.
The man, known as "Yuan" was found dead with the broken artery, full-body blood-tied at near a market stall in the Water Table, Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post delivered Sunday's newsletter.
A pig farmer prepares to give a vaccine to pigs in a butcher's oven on 30 May 2005 in Western Europe, Hai Province, China.
He was said to move with his cousin from the neighboring province of Cloud Nam on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found out that he had died, and saw a door of a pigsty just next to the open door.
He said that in the stall a large pig with blood marks around its mouth.
The report of a forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer to death.
"My brother's legs are bloody and insufficient," said his cousin known as "Wu" according to his share on Guiyang Evening News.
The image from the security camera shows Mr Yuan has arrived at the market around 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, he was found dead.
The killer pig is not a pig in the pigs of two brothers.
A market manager shares with Evening News that the pig was locked up to stop it from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the administration of the market are said to be negotiating compensation for his death.
Although not popular, the case of pigs attacking the person who had previously been recorded.
In 2016 a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the husband seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer shared on CBC News that pigs were generally not violent but the smell of blood could play the role of "the lure."
"They just want to be close.
"They're reserved, they're curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them a proper taste," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa carry heavy rain on a wide scale to the Southwestern United States
According to forecast, the Rosa Storm is weakening as the route turns towards the colder ocean at the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry rain and rain throughout North Mexico and the South West of the United States in the days to come.
Rosa has a wind of 85 mph, Hurricane Wind 1, which counts at 050pm in the morning of the East Sunday, and is determined to be 355 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure begins to form on the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the West Coast of the United States as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday when the tropical storm is formed, it will begin to carry more of the humidity of the North into the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up up to 10 inches of precipitation in the areas of Mexico on Monday.
Later, the humidity temperature encountered low pressure would cause heavy rainfall to spread in the southwest for the next few days.
In the locality, the amount of rain from 1 to 4 inches would cause dangerous sweeps, debris flows and even the possibility of crashing on the desert.
The humidity would cause the rainfall to reach two to three inches per hour at the universities, especially in areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
The amount of rain is expected to reach between 2 and 4 inches in the southwest areas, especially on the width of Arizona.
Scanrs can occur when the situation worsens rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
The situation would be extremely difficult to risk walking into the desert when there was a threat from tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can make the canyons into fierce rivers and storms that will carry local wind and dust tornadoes.
Low pressure would carry a number of local heavy rainfall places on the coast of Southern California.
The total amount of rain can reach over half an inch, easily causing debris lines and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain of the area during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains began to rain on Arizona at the end of Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain became more popular on the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will strike the Four Corners on Tuesday and extend to Wednesday.
There were some harsh temperatures across the United States in October when the Arctic was colder, but the tropical region remained quite warm.
This sometimes leads to significant changes in temperature in local areas that are close to one another.
A typical example of significant temperature difference in the Central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat of the summer and the heat of the siege will be renewed and renewed.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with a common temperature in around 80 in Southern Plains to the Northeast.
New York City Temperatures may reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Long weather forecasts are showing the possibility that high temperatures would be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million people have followed the Thursday hearing on six television systems of the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court candidate and the woman who accused him of a alleged sexual assault that occurred in the 1980s, Mrs Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political gridlock continues, with the TV interruptions interrupting the regular broadcast with the last-minute shock news on Friday: a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation on the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a calm move, said he was 100% sure that that didn't happen.
It is possible that more than 20.4 million people followed the hearing, according to Nielsen pointed out in the report on Friday.
The company has calculated the average ratings on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers don't include immediately for other television stations including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has some problems calculating viewers in his office.
In order to produce correlations, the audience numbers are similar to that of a final ticket or Oscar Award.
The Fox News Channel, who gave the program a strong support for the Kavanaugh nomination, led all the operators with an average rate of 5,69 million viewers during the day's hearing, Nielsen shared.
ABC stood second with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS with 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN is $2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The concern remained great after the hearing.
Flake is the central character in the noise Friday.
After the Republican peaceful character had just issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was followed by CNN and CBS's camera on Friday morning that he was shouted as he attempted to move the elevator to the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes facing down for a few minutes when questioned, being televised live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he told the whole country the truth?".
He was condemned that, "you have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake stated before the elevator closed that his office gave a statement, that he would have much to say at the committee's hearing.
All cable and television stations covered the air for several hours later, when the Judiciary Commission would have to vote on whether Brett Kavanaugh was nominated.
But Flake said that he would only do so upon learning that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate in the next week, which some of the minority Democrats urged.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his partner, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice carries weight, for it is clear that the Republicans will have no Kavanaugh approvals without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May counters the ‘police' criticisms for Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May rebuffed the criticism of the plan to leave the European Union as the "police article" with the future of the UK and undermined national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Session in Bristol, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside the interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, the Secretary-General Boris Johnson, emphasized his counterattack against their so-called Chevores deal on Brexit, suggesting that the British and EU proposals should collect each other's Yuan as "all absurd."
Shoot down Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson over the death of LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in the Wayde Sims murder case, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and detained with a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims fell in glass during the incident.
Police have discovered the glass from the scene and said they discovered Simpson's DNA on the glass, according to CBS's WAFB radio.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
The bail was designated for $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Baton Rouge area autopsy office released a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound from the head down the neck.
The department is counting on Louisiana State Police, the Anti-run Task Force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and regional residents to support the investigation for the arrest.
LSU's physical director Joe Alleva thanks the regional law agency for "introduction and pursuit of justice".
Sims is only 20 years old.
Six-foot-high six-year-old scout grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average you scored 5.6 points with 2.6 hits per game in the previous season.
On Friday morning, the LSU Will Wade basketball coach said the team had "heavyescu" and "wrong" before the death of Wayde.
Mr. Wade said: "The new thing is what you'll always have to watch your wings."
The volcano bursts into Mexico City.
Tros sprayed from the Popocatepetl volcano which flows to the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Defense Center warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the volcanic craters grabbed the operation and they recorded 183 emissions and ash in 24 hours.
The center has been tracking multiple vibrations and vibrations.
Pictures on the social network show thin layers of ash that obscure car windshields in the neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geologicalists have noted increased activity at the volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake 7.1°N richter shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano named "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police clashed with the Catalan separatist side before the anniversary of the independent vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independent protesters clashed with the riot police, when thousands of protesters marked the anniversary of the first vote of both sides of Catalonia on the separatist.
A group of masked dissidents held by anti-violent police by egg and powder paint, caused black dust clouds on streets often crowded with tourists.
The war broke out at the end of the day when police used sticks to suppress the fight.
For hours, independent supporters shouted "Unforgotten, Unforgiven" against protesters protesting against the words, "The Great Spanish".
Fourteen were treated for minor injuries in protests, according to local newspapers.
The tension remained high in the area according to independent thought for a year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal to Madrid but was received by the Catalan separatist.
Independent voters take over, although low approval rating ratings with anti-separatics most boycotters boycott the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent the vote from taking place at voting venues in the area between violent clashes.
Independent supporters had camped overnight Friday to prevent a protest in favor of the national police.
The protest had already taken place before but was forced to take place with another development.
Narcisses, 68, a powersmith who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife said that he had no hope for Catalonia's prospects for independence.
"We went through the happiest moments last year.
I watched my parents cry out of joy when they could vote but now we're trapped," he shared.
Although winning the major victory in the regional election in December last year, the independent supporters of Bristol fought to keep their motivation this year with many of their best-known leaders either isolated or detained for trial due to their role in the civilist referendum's subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, returned to the protest to support the police by his phone, stating that the conflict had been extinguished by politicians on both sides.
"The story is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oril Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in the prison before the trial since the end of last year, announced he would be running in the European Senate election next year.
"The expert as a candidate for the European election is the best way to report a decline in democratic and repressive values that we have witnessed from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: The men arrested when they crashed into the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car kept rushing into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Chandra on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Police investigating Bob Blemings said the incident caused damage to the portals and the building itself.
There's been a backfire of shots about the car at some point.
Menga's kick brought a 1-0 win to Livingston before Rangers.
Dolly Menga's previous lead helps Livingston to make sure the odds win.
Livingston was up to surprise Rangers when this Ibrox field team was led by Steven Gerrard with only two losses in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal-recording Phastories proved the difference when Gary Holt's side lifted to Hibernian in just a few seconds.
Gerrard's team has yet to have a separate goal in this season's foreign division and confronts the Hearts Oil Leaders, the team leading up to eight points, next Sunday.
Previously, Rangers welcomed Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile Livingston, has extended his series of undefeated matches in six matches, when head coach Holt has even tasted defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed her chance to fight the team below.
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they scored, with their live tactics making Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson struggled but crossed the goal, after which Alan Lithgow could only direct his efforts stronger later to bring the ball to Craig Halkett on the cross-field.
The homeowners are confident to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can trouble the guest team with personal techniques.
And that's the strategy for a set touchdown.
Rangers gave a penalty kick and Livingston lead, Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated towards Menga, who had a touchdown and scored right in the middle of the goal.
At this point, Rangers have taken over holding the ball but finds that the defensive line cannot penetrate and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly is barely having any trouble,
So the game went on to the second round, although Alfredo Torrez received assistance from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed at the foot of Rangers Allan McDonnell and Lithgow turned to another Livingston playplay.
Continuously leading the ball into the Livingston frame and constantly narrowed down, when there were two punishments in the pay - after Halkett's challenge to the replacement Glenn Middleton, one because of the touch to the ball - were successfully stopped.
'Content label' with Livingston - Analysis
from Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Games
One result and the finish-up match for Livingston.
The team was brilliant, continuing to reach far ahead in the back-stream dive.
Their style of playing and their players have rarely changed since they returned to the top position, but considerable credit has been given to Holt because of the way he sharpened the team since his appearance.
You have too many strong players.
Captain Halkett was a generalist, arranging a greatly organized line of defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on hold constantly.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
Just as they were under Gerrard, they failed to meet those standards.
The final missed—the only chance to open the home team's yard—and that was a wake-up call for Rangers, the goal-off team.
Erdogan received a variety of shades at Cologne
There were favorable smiles and weather on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - for the purpose of mending relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkish joining the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to attend the inauguration of a large-scale new mosque.
The city is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to stop the 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but a lot of supporters were nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurdish - also spoke out, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government welcomed him to this country.
The bipolar protests reflected the separation of a guest who was praised as a hero of some Turkish people in Germany and was cursed by others as a protagonist.

Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers were injured during the riot
Six officers were injured in a riot in a prison for male prisoners with strict security, the warden said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison at Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday morning and is still going on.
"Tornado experts" were brought to deal with the chaos, which ended around 17:30.
The officers were examined at the scene with minor injuries.
The spokesman for the Prison Management said: "The special training prison staff has been deployed to deal with the ongoing situation at HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured personnel were treated.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and it's clear that individuals involved will be transferred to the police and can spend time behind bars longer."
HM Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the warden of the prison had been treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, anti-insurgency officers were called on to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which employees were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa carrying Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with the Passing Flood (The Floods can be won)
It's very rare for tropical low pressure to attack Arizona, but that's exactly what can happen at the beginning of the week until the energy streaks of Hurricane Rosa on the southwest desert remain, pulling the flood risks.
The National Meteorological Department released sweep track on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona to South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Suez, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
The storm Rosa planned to follow a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, but earlier on Monday night there was a storm.
The National Meteorological Department of Phoenix has mentioned in a brief news that only "The tropical tornado formed a tropical storm or subtropical pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix from 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) is a storm within 40 miles of the border of Arizona."
The latest predictive model from the latest National Storm Center predicts a high rainfall of about 2 to 4 inches, with a separation of flooding levels up to 6 inches at the Mogollon Belt in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert consist of the Central Rockies and the Great Continental Can be flooded from 1 to 2 inches, with a separation flood level that can reach up to 4 inches.
With areas that did not flood suddenly, the rain from Hurricane Rosa may be a good sign because of the drought in the area.
Although flooding is a deep concern, some waterfalls can gladly welcome it as the Southeast is experiencing drought.
According to news from the May.com U.S. drought tracking agency says only over 40 percent of the Arizona area are suffering the lowest extreme drought, but still the second highest in the same category.
First, Hurricane Road Rosa passes by leaving landslides all over the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still in the storm range with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 12 miles per hour south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico 375 miles (385 km), and travels north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm collides with colder ocean currents in the Pacific Ocean and weakens.
Thus, forecasts indicate that landslides will be in Mexico when low tropical pressure passes on Monday evening.
Rainfalls to areas in Mexico may be significant, signaling the possibility of flooding is not minor.
According to Weather.com reporting "The amount of rain estimated between 3 and 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, can be up to 10 inches".
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday in the subtropical form, then will sweep through Arizona and land in South Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger of forecasting from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the South American desert," the National Storm Center said.
These rains are expected to cause sweep floods and floods to endanger the lives of deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.

Trump shares that Kavanaugh ‘bears the selfishness, anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the cruel and overly democratic tactics", Mr Trump said in a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr Trump said Mr. Kavanaugh "contained the selfishness, anger" of the Democratic Party during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh vs. Parliament on Thursday, strongly denied and strongly denied a charge from Christine Blasey Ford that he had attacked her sexually for decades before they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "American people saw the excellence and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to assert that one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a record of service to the true public," he stated to the crowd of West Virginia's supporters.
The President mentioned the details of Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy when speaking of the importance of voting for the Republican Party in the mid-term election.
There are only five weeks left before one of the most important elections of life.
I'm not running but I'm running." He shared.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for the bright candidates."
Mr Trump thinks the Democrats are wanting to "finish and hinder".
The first core procedure vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's candidate is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican leader's assistant revealed to CNN."
Hundreds of deaths caused by earthquakes, tsunamis in Indonesia, and increased losses
At least 384 killed, many were swept away when massive waves hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi Island, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds have gathered in a beach festival in Palu City on Friday when waves rise to six metres (18 feet) to shore at dusk, sweeps cause many to die and destroy everything on its way.
The tsunami follows a magnitude 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach and did not leave immediately and they became victims," Sutpo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman from the National Disaster Service (BNPB) shared in a text in Bristol.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it pulled with cars, wood, houses, swept through everything on land," said Nugroho, and further stated that the tsunami had passed the open sea at 800 kph (497 miles/hour) before landing on the coast.
Some climb up the tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the air released by the disaster agency indicate many buildings and shops destroyed, broken bridges and collapsed and a mosque flooded in the water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes has been observed in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Charter and Technology Effects (BPPT) said in its energy-powered release launched by the strong Friday earthquake was about 200 times as high as the nuclear bomb's power dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, according to the release.
Nugroho described the damage as "large" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the wreckage of the collapsed buildings, he related, another 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho states that casualties and casualties may not have stopped as the coasts of 300 km (1990 mi) to the north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The media "completely paralyzed with no news" from Donggala, Mr Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there" The Red Cross said in a statement, at the same time stating that their employees and volunteers are coming to the affected areas.
"This has been a tragedy, but tragedy can become much more horror," they said.
The agency was widely condemned on Saturday for not announcing that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the wave had arrived as a time of warning was given.
In an unprofessional video posted on social networking, it is possible to hear a man standing on high who is screaming in panic for those in the street about the approaching tsunami.
A few minutes later, a water wall swept ashore, sweeping with buildings and cars.
Reuters can't verify the footage yet.
The earthquake and tsunami caused major blackouts that caused a break in the area communications around Palu caused the authorities to have difficulty in combining rescue efforts.
Officials say, the Army has begun to cut out freight planes with assistance from Ahmad and other cities, but the evacuationes still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will plan to visit the evacuation centers at Palu on Sunday.
The number of Dead people in the Indonesian Waves increases more than 800.
It's very bad.
While the staff of the World Vision from Donggala arrived safely at Palu City, where the employees were in the basilies erected in the office yard, they went through the devastating scenes along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They tell me they see a lot of homes destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began significant movements when starting disaster relief tools, some complained that foreign relief workers with advanced expertise had been prevented from moving to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, private and humane items from overseas can only begin to perform if the site of the disaster is declared to be a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provinceal disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government decides, "Yes, this is a national disaster", then we can be ready for international support but there is no statement."
As the second night falls to Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of people who are still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the magic that binds the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled up from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman trapped under the wreckage for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subondono, the Indonesian national parachute coach, coached two of the missing paragliding players for the Asian Sports Conference, which was held early this month in Indonesia.
Others were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including British Mandag, were his students.
"As a veteran in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon relates, for several hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa which spread in the paragliding community, he was desperately texting with whatsApp for his opponents at Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
His message, however, only reported a gray volume instead of two blue plaques.
"I think that means the messages have not been sent," he said.
The robbers took $26,750 when the ATM was paid in Newport in Levee.
According to news from the Newport Police Department, the robbers took $26,750 from a Brink banker when they were loading money into an ATM in Newport in Levee.
Driver on the car cleaned the ATMs in the recreation area and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy delivered the article.
When he was busy, a man "exploited from behind the Brink employee" and took the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the report, the witnesses saw multiple suspects surrounding the scene, but the police had not yet identified the number of subjects involved in the case.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspect involved please contact the Newport Police at 859-292-380.
Kanye West: Rapper renamed Ye
Rapper Kanye West renamed Ye.
He wrote in an announcement about the change on Twitter on Saturday: "People used to know me as Kanye West."
West, 41, had named the art Ye for a time and used the name as the eighth album name released in June.
The change took place before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release the new album Yandhi.
He was a guest of the show on behalf of the singer Arana Grande when she told herself "an emotional disorder", the show creator said.
As well as the abbreviation in his current art of name, West previously said the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that "ye" is the most widely used word in the Bible and in the Bible the word means "friend", West shared earlier this year, as he was talking about his album title with Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, we are.
The transition from Kanye, which means only, to Ye - the reflection of good, evil, trouble, everything.
The album is more than our own reflection.
You're one of the best-known rappers to rename.
Sean Combs is widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he was targeting Love and Brother Love.
An artist who once collaborated with West, JAY-Z, is also concerned about having or having no dashes and writing flowers.
The President of Mexico announced that he would not send troops against civilians
President-electing Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has declared that he will never use military forces against civilians as this country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody revenge that oppresses students.
Lopez Obrador made a commitment on Saturday at Tlateloloco Square that "never brought troops to oppress the people of Mexico."
The army fired in a peace protest at the Square on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at that moment as left-wing students were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support the young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening additional public universities free of charge.
He shares that the problem of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities has led young people to get involved in vices.
The United States should double aid A.I.
As China becomes more active in its artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money spent on research in this field, investors and apprentices of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who once worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple shared.
The opinions were given after various parts of the U.S. government issued an AI announcement, even while the U.S. overall was lacking official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plans last year: the goal of becoming the nation's lead on AI innovation to 2030.
"Trying the AI research budget will be a positive start, as all other countries fall behind the United States very far, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Double the budget may double the opportunity that the next giant AI achievement will be carried out in the United States, Lee shares with CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "Institutional Intelligence Power: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published in this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director of Sinovation Venza, has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face Dyer.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at an AI system defeating the player Fairfax in the United States with the highest rank, then he was executive director at Microsoft Research and the director of Google Branch in China.
Lee approaches former U.S. government technology competitions such as the Machine Challenge of the Advanced Project Research Agency and cares when the next competition will take place, in order to help determine the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government aid, Lee shares.
"It's not China calling on all the scholars to take the lead; it's corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired bright stars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee shares changes in immigration policies that can also help the United States strengthen their AI efforts.
He added: "I think the green card should be automatically granted to the Ph.D.s on AI."
The China Institute has launched the next generation of Human Intelligence Development Plan in July, 2017.
Lee added: China's National Science Foundation provides aid to those who belong to academic institutions similar to how the Foundation and other government organizations grant money to the researchers of the United States, but the quality of research in lower China.
Earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Defence established a People's Association of Minds, which was intended to intervene to partners from industry and education, and the White House has announced the establishment of the Human Intelligence Select Committee.
During this month the Department of Defense Research Administration announced $2 billion investment for a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they currently invest over $100 million per year for AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law sought to establish a National Security Council on Human Intelligence but had not seen any action in months.
The people of Macedonia voted in the referendum on the change of the country's name
The Macedonians voted in the referendum on Sunday about whether to rename the Northern Macedonia Peace, which was an act of resolution that lasted for decades with Greece in order to prevent joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, the country has a province called Macedonia, asserting that the name of the northern neighboring country corresponds to its own territory and has debutived the involvement of NATO and EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but the protesters of nationalism claimed that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavs in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the rally and that a boycott campaign had developed doubts about whether voters would respond to a 50% minimum requirement for the legality of the referendum.
The question on the referendum carries content: "Do you agree to become NATO and EU member with approval of the deal with Greece."
The supporters of renamed, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claimed that it was a price to pay in the pursuit of joining organizations such as EU and the NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the fall of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, at Skopje said. "Today I come to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can freely enjoy the patronage of the European Union because that leads to a safer life for all of us."
Although the members of the parliament were not legally bound, they said they would comply with the vote results to make the decision.
Change of name will require two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The National Election Committee said there were no reports of any irregularity until 1:00 p.m.
However, the electoral rate reached only 16%, compared to 34% in the last year's parliamentary election when 66% of the voters registered the vote.
The Gjose Tanevski voters, 62 years old at the capital of Skopje, shared: "I go to vote because my children, because our position is in Europe."
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, Mrs Zorica his wife and brother Dushko his son voted in the Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for NATO and European Union in Stremica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small platform and pulls up the front seat of the hut erected by those who would boycott the referendum.
Kavadarkov said: "We support NATO and EU, but we want to participate in the main road, not through the rear door."
"We're a poor country, but poor for clean.
If they don't see us as Macedonia, then we can move to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Asian-Candida bond."
Prime Minister Zaev said that being a NATO member would bring very radical investments to Macedonia, where unemployment rated over 20%.
"I believe most will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens support EU and NATO," said Zaev after voting.
He shared that a "opportunity" result would be "the assertion of our future."
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonia Policy Institute stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - lower than required voting levels.
Another poll, made by Telma TV of Macedonia, stated 57 percent of people were asked to have plans to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they had a yes vote.
A successful referendum must have a vote rate of 50 percent and a vote.
The defeat in the referendum shows the first serious blow to the policy of the West's close government since the time it took in May last year.

Scherzer wants to burn himself against Rockies.
With the Nationals removed from the final ticket game, there's not much to start over.
But a wary Scherzer hopes to win his Sunday field with Colorado Rockies, but this only makes sense when there's a playoff for Rockies, the team leading a game against Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies won at least one speciality with a 5-2 win before Nationals on Friday night, but was still trying to hold on to the top championship.
"Although the playing was pointless, at least we were bowled when we learned about the atmosphere in Denver along with the crowd and other teams would play with any of the highest levels I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight in a fight like that?
The Nationals haven't announced the player's opening in the game on Sunday, but it looks like Scherzer will be pitched in this situation.
Scherzer, who throws his 34th start, will have pitch practice on Thursday and compete on his Sunday day.
The Washington team's right arm has a record of 18-7 with 2.53 AA (the average run value) and 300 hits in 220-thirds of this season's competition.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The President mentioned the situation details surrounding his Supreme Court, selecting Brett Kavanaugh when speaking of the importance of voting for the Republican Party in the mid-term election.
"Everything we've done has potential in November.
There are only five weeks left before one of the most important elections of life.
This is one of the big, big things - not running but running is the reason I go around fighting for the bright candidates." he shared.
Mr Trump continues: "You'll see the negative, negative Democratic Party is existing right now.
And they are determined to suppress their power by using any means, and then you will see the selfishness, the tricks.
They don't care who hurts, who has to step over to gain power and control, they just want power and control, and we don't give it to them."
He added, "The Democratic Games are trying to "contain and hinder".
"You've seen it in the last four days." He added and claimed that the Democrats were "stirious and selfish and devious and false."
He pointed out that the Senate Judiciary Committee identified the Democratic Senator Cordelia Feinstein, which stumbled over the screaming from below.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the information?
What?
No, oh no, I expect – it's a kind of body language that's not outstanding - that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer an open party.
Making an opinion is unacceptable
I was not surprised when Momentum's activists, in my local party, voted to censor me.
Eventually, I was the newest in a series of Labour Party parliamentaries to be informed that I was not welcome - for making an opinion.
As a member of the parliament with me, Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was determined to support opposition.
In my case, the censor action was aimed at me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of an economic policy of magnitude, on national security, in Europe, the same ironic issues that Jeremy disagreed with earlier leaders.
Announced for the Nottingham East Labor Party meeting on Friday stating that "we want the meetings to be comprised and effective."
During nearly eight years as a Congressman for the local Labour Party, Friday Evening Leaders meetings were all such a style.
Sadly, today, it is not the tone in many meetings and the political promise "more kind, gentler" that has long been forgotten and indeed that it has ever begun."
It became increasingly clear that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion was rated on whether the party heads would approve.
This started soon after Jeremy became the leader, because my former colleagues I thought my political views had begun to expect me to change my mind and take positions that I would never accept - whether it was about national security or the EU markets.
Whenever I speak openly - and really whether I say anything - drags abuse on social media calls for removal, central politics, telling me I shouldn't be joining the Labor Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments pointed at me are political.
I'm surprised by the professionality and determination of my colleagues, who face the flow that carries the abuse of sexism or racism every day but who never dodges.
One of the most sad aspects of this political age is that the level of abuse has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should cherish the culture of tolerance.
The fact that we are no longer that extended party and that with every "untrusted" action or the change in rule of choice, the party has become narrowed down.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years about urging me to stay calm, not too much and then I'll be fine.
But I'm not in politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was just a boy, I was motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which has caused my comprehensive school to collapse literally, I have sought to bring better public services to those who need them most — whether local commissioner or minister of state.
I never hide my political views, even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be wronged about the political positions and my differences with the current leadership.
For those of you who have driven the move on Friday, all I want to share is when my country is in Brexit, which is going to hurt our households, our businesses and our public services, I don't want to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party Leader.
But indeed, a message outside Nottingham Momentum that I guard my wings, send to my voters, whether I'm a member of the Labor Party or not: I'm proud to be served and I promise there will be no threat of elimination or any political means which prevents me from acting for what I believe is the greatest benefit to relatives.
Chris Leslie is the Congressman of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr undefeated take the lead
The following two tries may have misdirected the final result, but no doubt, Ayr deserved to win the Tennent Premiership tournament in the day.
They're now at the top of the board, the sole crown of ten teams.
Either way, it's their super defense line, as well as the better opportunity for them, to bear the host's name and coach Peter Murchie's right to be fully pleased.
He said: "So far, we've walked through his games so far and we're undefeated, so I'm content."
Robyn Christie of Melrose stated: "Confirmed for Ayr, they seize better opportunities than we do."
Pha scored Grant Anderson's 14th minute goal, scored by Frazier Fiermo further, giving Ayr lead, but, a gold card to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, opening the game for Warriors, allowing Melrose to express the craft and Jason Baggot to cast a ball to the goal bridge.
Midrio rose to lead Ayr by a penalty, earlier, in the first round, he scored the goal then scored with a solo bowl raising the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started in the second round in a favourable way and Patrick Anderson made his debut, Baggot scored further, shorting the score down to five points.
After a long period of serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had been dropped, and since re-started, Ayr has led ahead due to the establishment of Carpenter McDowall, Reinhardt scored further points.
The Captain's Right, Blair Macpherson, was later beaten with gold, and again, Melrose made the underdog player pay with a no-point scorer by Bruce Colvine, in front of a strain.
However, the homeowners were back, and when Struan Hutchinson got the gold card for confrontation with Kurdoo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson scored a score on the Ayr's back-up advantage.
The extra score, as he did almost since his return, after Kyle Rowe received David Armstrong's pitch and passed to the winger Gregor Henry after scoring the fifth goal of the home team.

‘The Sea is Ours: Bolivian non-sea nation hopes the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol an armed naval headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings hung the blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Guadalupe to Amazon are all painted further slogans: "Marie is our right.
It's our duty to have the ocean back."
Every corner of Bolivia's land, the memory of a beach lost to Chile in the 19th century bloodied resource conflict is still vivid — as well as the desire to row out to the Pacific again.
Such hopes may have been the burningst for decades, since Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of consideration.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, shares: "Bolivia has motivation, spirit of unity and calmness, and, of course, expectations in a positive view of results."
Many Bolivians will follow ICJ's rulings on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia's statement, that - after decades of stressful exchanges - Chile has the obligation to negotiate for Bolivia a sovereign seaway.
Evo Morales, the convincing original president of Bolivia, who faces a fierce debate to re-election next year - also has multiple cards in the Monday's ruling.
At the end of August, he insisted: "We are about to return to the Pacific Sea."
But some analysts claim that the court is incapable of deciding to support Bolivia - and this is less likely to change.
The UN with its headquarters in the Netherlands has no right to return the territory to Chile and has stipulated that they will not determine the results of potential exchanges.
ICJ's ruling was given only six months after the final debates were given that the situation "was not complicated," said Mrs. Paz Zárate, an expert on Chile's international law.
And beyond that, Bolivia's lawsuit, is that the last four years can be reversed.
Zárate said: "The issue of access to the sea has been attacked by the current Bolivian administration."
She added, Mr Morales's waristic claims have turned down the rest of Chile's goodwill.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not traded ambassador since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the opinion that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era with relations with Chile" and an opportunity to end 139 years of mutual differences," he shared.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - remained one of the most famous presidents in Latin America - was using the maritime issue as a political life preserve.
Bolivia added: "Bolivia will never give up her right to access to the Pacific."
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to walk through the past."
Koreans say there will never be a nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States.
Foreign Minister CHDDD Korea Ri Yong Ho revealed that his country would never disarm nuclear weapons unless they could trust Washington before.
Mr. Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill promises in the summit in Singapore between the leaders on both sides.
He made a remark when US Secretary Mike Pompeo seemed to be on the verge of re-starting the nuclear foreign policy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with the Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Mr. Ri said that it was a "imaginary dream" when continued U.S. sanctions and objections to the claim that the end of the Korean War was to bring Korea to submission.
Washington is careful to agree with the statement without the first any noticeable actions of the armament of arms.
Both Mr. Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump desire a second summit.
But there's no small cynicism that Ping Ahmad is very serious about giving up a arsenal that this country might consider the only way to secure.
Mr. Pompeo is planning a visit to Ahmad next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The fashion of Paris releases the latest production line of the broad rim caps that are about to spread across the major streets near you
If you want to move your hat collection or completely stay out of the sun then you don't have to look any further.
The designer Valentina and Thom Browne reveal a series of strange large-sized team designs in their SS19 collection on the runway that would be a shock to the design style at the Paris Fashion Week.
High-performing caps have swept Instagram this summer and the designers mentioned above have brought their eyes to the stage.
Valentino's outstanding item is an over-regular top bet with feather-like accessories, which cover the model's head.
Other oversized accessory accessory accessories include styloid melons, witch caps and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also reveals a series of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks are sewn in a style more similar to Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One design is like a complete sea-diving device with a tube and a protective lens, and another device that looks like a melting cinnamon ice cream.
And if you're going to keep going in giant fashion -- you're in luck.
The tomb predicts that large-sized ears caps may soon cover the streets near you.
The large caps became hot on the heels of ‘La Bomba', a few-inch broad-inch ring cap used by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The franchise behind the cap is extremely unrealisticly thrown across social media that has brought another big innovation onto the stage - a bag that goes to the beach almost the size of a bathing suit.
The burning orange raffia bag, which is bordered in raffia with the upper hand in white leather, is a prominent item in the La Tribune SS19 collection of Jacqudus at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity Model Luke Armitage shares with FEMAIL: ‘I expect to see large-sized sea caps and bags filling the big streets in the coming summer - as the designer has produced an impact that can hardly ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.'
John Edward: Foreign Language Skills are essential to global citizens
The private schools in Scotland maintained their outstanding academic style, which was continued in 2018 with a laudable school result series, strengthened by both individual and collective in sports, art, music, and community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, they are sponsored by the Scottish Private School Council (SCIS), are trying to bring the best service quality to students and parents.
Independent schools tend to equip deep and broad knowledge, as well as to navigate careers and the positions of students as global citizens.
As an educational division that can design and run the school's special curriculum, we see modern languages that continue to be a popular subject and are chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, what you say goes into his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, what you say goes into his heart."
This is a convincing message that we do not rely solely on English when we desire to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From recent exams this year, we can see that languages are leading in ranking tables with the number of subjects in the private school that are top-notch.
The total of 68 percent of foreign language students scored higher than the score A.
Data collected from 74 member schools of SCIS shows 72 percent of students reaching more than A in Chinese, besides 72 percent learning German, 69 percent learning French, and 63 percent learning Spanish also scored A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are following a foreign view of skills that children and teenagers will not be unable to have in the future.
The free language subjects are being considered as the main SMCA (Techology, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in private school programs as well as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the 2014 British Association of Skills and Industry shows in the reasons why recruiters have difficulty finding people, as a result of a lack of foreign language skills.
As a result, foreign language skills become increasingly practical in order to equip young people to enter the future profession.
With the more career prospects for being in a foreign language, these skills become practical in a world that is increasingly flat.
No matter how people choose to work, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
It is possible to communicate directly in the language of the natives themselves that a multi-languager will obviously take the lead in every challenge.
According to a survey by YouGov over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of them could not practice a simple assembly in another language, and only French was the only language to have the ratio to a single number of units, 15 percent.
That is why investing in a foreign language is urgent for children today.
In the hands of multilinguals, especially the languages of developing economies, will equip children with a brighter potential for finding a real job.
In Scotland each school taught different languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern languages, while some other schools will teach foreign languages that are considered important to Britain in vision to 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of children, there is a variety of languages to choose from within the range of private schools, along with a team of specialized teachers in the profession.
Private schools in Scotland concentrate on bringing in a prepared and equipped academic environment that gives children the skills necessary for success, no matter what the future holds hidden.
Undeniably, in an international business environment, foreign languages will continue to be a very important factor in the future of the nation, this should be multiplied in education.
In fact, modern languages should be rated as " international communication skills".
The private schools will continue to offer this opportunity to young Scotsmen: variety and excellence.
There can be no choice.

TT. Trump campaign in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
Tonight, at Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump began his campaign.
This is the first stop in TT. Trump's five campaigns, Trump's next week, including stops in support states such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
The standard vote for the candidate he nominated for the empty seat of the pending Supreme Court, President Trump is trying to gain support before the upcoming mid-election, when the Republican Party is at risk of losing control of Parliament as the vote begins in November.
TT. Trump's campaign in West Virginia began at what time tonight and how can you watch online?
TT. Trump's campaign in Wheeling City, West Virginia is expected to begin at 7 pm tonight on Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can track TT. Trump's campaign in West Virginia which is live on YouTube.
President Trump may refer to this week's hearing by Brett Kavanaugh - Supreme Court candidate - who is currently facing sexual assault charges and the Senate's standard vote must be moved back a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
However, the main purpose of these rushing campaigns was to compete to pull support for Republican candidates before the election in November.
Thus, according to Reuters, the campaign goal passes 550 campaigns next week to "responsive the volunteers and Republican supporters in the Republican race for protection and extension of the majority of the votes they hold in the Senate and House".
"Conservation of Congress is a major issue in the agenda, so the president will visit as many states as possible before entering the busy election season," a campaign spokesman for TT. Trump desired to be concealed to Reuters.
Planning to take place in the Wesbanco Games, Wheeling City, tonight's campaign may attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, at the same time attract Pittsburgh media to the news", West Virginia Metro News Radio.
Saturday will be TT. Trump's second visit in the past month to West Virginia, the state he won off 40 percent in 2016.
TT. Trump is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, Republican candidate for the West Virginia Minor State Senatorship, as this man currently ranks in the polls.
According to Reuters, Quoting Simon Hared, a political scientist at West Virginia University: "The president's visit to the state to gain support in the candidate vote is not a good sign to Morrisey".
Ryder Cup 2018: The American team expressed its determination to keep the trophy in single matches on Sunday
After three unweighted matches, the double match on Saturday afternoon may be necessary for the Ryder Cup.
The wrist spin in the shake-style to create momentum is a whole new sport concept, but also the one that the athlete really believes in, especially in games like this.
So where is the current momentum?
"They lead six points ahead, fly now only 4, and I suppose that's the motivation for us," said Jordan Spieth to share as he walks to relax.
Of course, the European team had the advantage, leading four points, and they had 12 more games.
As Spieth said, the American team still had a little bit of hope and they were greatly encouraged, especially with the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who had been in pairs a lot of times and who had spent three points each.
Spieth was a veteran golfer in the cast of the ball from the pitching position to the golf hole and he always took the lead as a mirror.
The shouting was growing louder as he arrived in his play, especially the pitch to ease the match as he and Thomas turned the ball into a golf hole.
The 15th game win is the same thing, which means you're full of confidence in the backstroke of the American team.
Spieth said: "You have to think hard and worry about your own game".
All the athletes have left.
There's 18 left to score.
In the last two days, only Ahmad Molari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed legend of the Ryder Cup, have been the only couple to win higher scores than Spieth and Thomas.
This odd but respectable pair of European teams once won 4:0 and could not make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only match not to hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also to avoid bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine later golf holes on Friday morning.
That victory and the energy source from them spread to the crowd of cheerleaders giving people the feeling that the two of them were the opponents who needed to beat on Sunday; and that no more golfers were more worthy than Fleetwood or Molari to defend the European team's victory at sunset on Lefring National Stadium.
Hopefully, both of you appear in different golf holes at the same time.
Even so, it is too early to claim the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball series in the morning, when competing against Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes caused Spanish and Swedish golfers to completely lose their chance of counterattack.
On Sunday, I'm afraid no one can pull them out of that failure either.
The Fourball and Foursome matches were always the most remarkable because of the interaction between the double sets, their advice and their observations of the game strategy change only in seconds.
The European team competed better teammates and led quite far ahead of the final match date, but this series of Foursome shows that the American team had a full chance of winning.
The European team led 10-6 before the start of the Ryder Cup final day.
The European team will take advantage of the final day of the Ryder Cup after the spectacular Fourball and Foursome series, leading in front of the American 10-6 team.
The double Tommy Fleetwood and Ahmad Molari led this advantage with two Tiger Woods wins to win four more points on Le Gothic National Field.
Thomas Bjorn side of the European team, with the determination to win back the cup to lose in the hands of your team in Hazeltine two years ago, won an overwhelming victory over the U.S. side of the 4ball in the morning, leading before 3-1.
The American team competed better in the Foursome series, winning two games, but couldn't win the final.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in the singles series on Sunday to win the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European golfer to win four consecutive points when he and Molari, often referred to as the pair "Molliwood" as the second couple after the dramatic league weekend that won four points in the four opening games in the Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the game of Fourball, they had a more convincing victory over Woods and new American recruit Bryson Dechambeau with a score of 5&4.
Woods played two games on Saturday and sometimes there were flash moments, but to date, he lost 19/29 games in the Fourball series and Foursome, including 7 consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, after resting in the fourball series of morning games returned with Henrik Stenson in the Foursome game, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the two golfers are ranking 1 and 3th in the world, with a 2&1 score.
Despite the pleasant southwestern weather of Paris, however, the European team did not have an easy day.
Golfer once won three large wins Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the key landmark for the American team with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 convincing victory ahead of the Spanish golfer, Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the Fourball game, and then continued to defeat Pouter and Rory McIroy with a 4&3 score in the Foursome, despite missing the first two holes.
In the Ryder Cup history, only twice a team is led by 4 points that can start single matches, though, the Furyk team is able to hold the trophy.
After being considered second only in two days, Sunday is likely to become a back-line leak for this team.
North Korea claims 'there's no way' freeing the armor in one place without faith
The Korean foreign minister stated before the United Nations on Saturday, asserting that the sanctions are still being maintained further deepening their suspicion of the United States and in this situation, there is no way that the country has abandoned its nuclear weapons alone.
Ri Yong Ho stated in the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, saying that North Korea has taken "many good measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing cases, removing nuclear testing facilities and commitments not to make nuclear weapons and nuclear technology popular.
"But we don't see the same action from the US side," he said.
"If we can't trust the US, then we won't be able to guarantee national security, and in a situation like this, there's no way we're going to disarm ourselves first."
Although Mr. Ri still repeats Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's rejection of nuclear disarmament "in stages" and North Korea will receive the corresponding benefit of taking step-by-steps, this time his statement has a notable point not to refuse the solo elimination of nuclear weapons such as Ping Ahmad had previously refused.
Ri refers to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Mr. Donald Trump at the first summit between a current U.S. President and a Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in this statement, Kim pledges his efforts to "distinguish nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula," while Mr. Trump promises security for Korea.
North Korea is still trying to find a way to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US insists that Ping Ahmad must give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also protested the appeals to loosen the harsh international sanctions against TKO Elf.
"US insists on "published nuclear weapons first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve goals in a forced manner, even protesting "taire to end war", Mr. Ri stated.
"The notion that the genius can punish us can bring us down on our knees is just the fantasy of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem here is that the sanctions that remain are continuing to lose our trust."
Ri did not refer to the plan to hold the second summit between Chairman Kim and President Trump as the U.S. leader presented at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, this foreign minister referred to three meetings between President Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the nuclear disarmament negotiations were Korean, non-American, then the non-humanised Korean peninsula negotiations would not be at the same risk as we are now."
Even so, Ri's tone differed from last year, when he told the General Assembly that it was inevitable for Korea to launch missiles into the U.S. Continentals in a suicide mission after "The Evil President" Trump called Mr. Kim "The Missile".
Last year at the United Nations, Trump threatened to "completely destroy" Korea, but this year's praise ended with Mr. Kim's courage to take steps to disarm, but Mr Trump also emphasized that there is still a great deal of work to be done and the sanctions to remain intact until the end of Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, TT. Trump stated he did not set a deadline for this: "Two years, three years or just five months won't be a problem."
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should reward the Peace of Ahmad for their efforts.
However, U.S. Foreign Secretary Mike Pompeo on Thursday told the United Nations Security Council that "the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be carried out vigorously and unsatisfactory until we can confirm the non-humanization results completely, eventually, with proof."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against Korea since 2006 in order to stop funding for the ballistic and nuclear missile programs of Pingnan.
Foreign Secretary Pompeo has spoken to Secretary Ri on the side of official meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and has stated he will visit Ping Ahmad again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Mr Pompeo visited Korea three times this year, but the final visit was not very good.
He left Ping Ahmad after his visit in July and said that the negotiations had taken certain developments, but only hours later, North Korea accused the foreign minister of making "the same demands as the gangster."
North Korea is committed to the meeting with Korea President Moon Jae-In in this month to dismantle a rocket test base and a nuclear complex if the US has "the same action."
He said Chairman Kim directed that "the same action" he was looking for was the security guarantee that Trump had committed during the conference in Singapore and advanced normally in relation to Washington.
Harvard students took the course for adequate rest
In an attempt against the chemical learning mechanical pressure, with the 'night owl' drinking coffee change water, a new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all college students to sleep more.
Students who study at the 1st University of this world often have little knowledge of the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard University of Medicine, and expert at Women's Hospital and Brigham Hospital who designed this course and himself believed that this was the first course of this type in the United States.
The inspiration to start this course came after he took a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
'After the end of the talk, a student came up to me and said, 'Why didn't you know it till the end of the year?'
She said that no one told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me really), he shared with The Telegraph.
The course is first introduced this year, explaining to students the importance of good sleep habits that enhance their academic and athletic results, and at the same time improve their general health.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychology at Harvard University and Director of Medical Services of the University, said the school decided to introduce the course after finding students who had severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course lasts an hour including a series of interactive tasks.
In part there is pictures of the dorm room, in which students can click on coffee cups, curtains, machines, and books to learn about the effects of Melbourne, light and sleep deprivation that affect how athletic exercise results, as well as the importance of forming sleep habits on time.
In another part, participants are found to learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Later, the university campus map, with interactive symbols, encouraged participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know this course cannot immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that the children have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effect on health when choosing to smoke, Professor Czeisler added.
He said: The culture that prides "night owl student" still exists, and contemporary technologies and increasing pressure for students that lead to sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To ensure sufficient sleep, the quality of good sleep should become the secret air of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to fall into starvation, which leads to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who was studying biology, chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design this course, and he also joined one of the classes last year in Harvard's first year.
He said that the course helped him to ‘ open his eyes ’ and inspired him to make an effort to hold a course in a schoolwide range.
He hoped that the next step would be to offer all postgraduate students a similar curriculum before starting competition in the primary course.
Professor Czeisler advises students to consider when setting an alarm to go to bed, hours to wake up, and at the same time to be aware of the harm of 'green light' coming out of electronic screens and LEDs, which can cause your biological rhythm, which leads to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga knocks down Gerrard's boys
Rangers had a unsuccessful day at Dolly Menga's counterattack which caused Steven Gerrard's team to fail with a 1-0 in front of Livingston.
The Ibrox field owners hope to mark the first win since the 4-1 win at St Johnstone Field in February, but Gary Holt's team caused the second loss Gerrard in 18 matches as head coach, stretching the distance eight points from the Ladbrokes Premiership Cort.
Menga maintains the offensive seven minutes before the end of the 1st round, but Rangers' spirit never seem to be crushed.
Rangers have now fallen to 6th place, while Livingston has climbed third place, and only after Hibernian about the odds.
And Rangers had to deal with another problem after the Cabum Spence refress had to treat the head injury after an object was clearly thrown from the top of the guest yard.
Gerrard changed the formation eight times over the formation that passed Aryr to enter the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, kept Livi 11 even and won a point before the Hearts team last week and he must have been overjoyed with the way his pupils besieged the opponent in each of the attacks.
Although Rangers hold the ball more often, Livingston is the one who is the real danger of having the ball.
They were supposed to score just two minutes after Menga first threw Scott Pittman into the yard, attacking Allan McDonnell's goal frame but this quarterback missed this opportunity.
A deep shot by Keaghan Jacobs brought the ball to the foot of Captain Craig Halkett, but the rear guard Alan Lithgow could only bring the ball to the back of the frame.
Rangers take control of the ball on the field, but their play is based mainly on hope more than on belief, especially in the last one-third of the game.
Alfredo Torrez certainly assumed that he should have a penalty on the penalty for the penalty due to the fact that he and Steven Lawless had crashed but the referee Steven Ahmad rejected the appeal of this Colombian player.
Rangers only hit the goal goal goal in the first round twice, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's head blow and Ovie Ejaria's counterattack.
Although Livi's opening the score in the 34th minute is thought to be an advantage, no one can deny that their victory is entirely deserved.
Once again, Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs' deep-cut pitch.
Scott Arfield was unable to respond when Declan Gallagher poked Scott Robinson, while Scott calmly chose Menga to make a simple finish.
Gerrard immediately had a plan during the break, by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the replacement of this man was nearly an immediate impact as this winger pushed the ball to Morelos but Kelly impressed on the immediate obstruction of the ball direction.
But Livingston succeeded in getting the group to play the same game as they wanted, when Lithgow and Halkett constantly released the long passes.
Holt's team had the chance to rise to the front in the final minutes of the game, but unfortunately McDonnell chose the right place to stop Jacobs before Lithgow hit the head wide from the corner.
The new player entered Glenn Middleton's field again complained of the claim of the penalty after the collision with Jacobs, but was again rejected by the referee Ahmad.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger Count
Quoted a page from the Yearbook "July": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and MEDIM ... future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, inventing the basis for the device known as the Geiger Count.
Since then, Geiger Count not only became a pillar of science, but also a pillar of popular culture. The following example is a dialogue in the film "Bells of Durham", the 1950 premiere, with the participation of the scientist and the cowboy king Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Count, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headsets on, you can actually hear the impact of atoms due to radiation in minerals coming out."
Evans: "That's right, there's a click coming from here!"
"Heans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention in his name remains with time.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system how to 'observe' cells are damaged
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system how to "observe" cells that break down and destroy them
The battery teaches the immune system how to recognize damaged cells in the treatment.
This method includes taking the immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the lab.
These cells can then 'see' the common protein in many cancers and are re-injected into the body
A test vaccine is producing positive results in patients with different cancers.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine taught the immune system to recognize damaged cells and her ovarian cancer cells disappeared after more than 18 months.
This method includes taking the immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the lab, so that these cells can "see" the protein that is common in many cancers, called HER2, then the cell is injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our research results show that we are in the hands of a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "Presses the development of some type of cancer", including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and rectal rectum, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of research, taking the immune cells from the patient's body and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells, used to work in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye received a lot of "rock" when expressing mad support for TT. Trump, the MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) after Saturday's Live Music Night (SNL)
Things didn't go well.
Kanye West received a lot of screaming in the studio throughout the SNL Music Night, after his wildly active performance, during the performance, he praised American President Donald Trump and claimed to run in 2020.
After performing the third song, Ghost Town, still wearing the Make America Great Against (Make America Strong Again), he angrily expressed his opposition to the Democratic Party and claimed support for TT. Trump.
"Many times I talk to white friends, they say, "Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I was worried about racism, I'd be out of the U.S. for a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with a minor that had Matt Damon's involvement.[citation needed] In the minor, this Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual assault charges of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the show was not broadcast, the video recording of West's angry speech was posted on the social network by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was deliberately making fun of West when it appeared.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was uncomfortable behind the chicken wing just because of his hat.
"They bullied me at the back of the scenes.
They said, 'Don't show up with that hat.'
They bullied me!
Then they say I'm wet," he shares, according to the Washington Journal.
West goes on: "Do you know what it's like to get wet?", he claims to "take my hero's iconic hat, because no one can force me to do something about it." If you want the world to move on?
Have love."
The Variety News: His speech made the audience scream at least two times, and the SNL's participants were confused, one of whom said, "The whole studio is silent."
West was chosen to replace the singer Arana Grande, because this girl's boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love It, in a costume like a Chai Perrier.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner.[citation needed] This man had previously posted on Twitter page: "To give one of the most courageous souls: XIN BEST OF THE BITCH".
But the host Karen Hunter posted on Twitter was simply West "just acting according to his nature, and this is really great."
"But I choose not to commend someone (by buying music products or costumes, or supporting his 'art') because I believe that he is pursuing and spreading the ideology badly for my community.
He has the right to be free.
So do we," she added.
Before the show, this rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, officially "named Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, but just to follow the path of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Daddy.
Another rapper, Snooop Dogg formerly known as Snooop Lion; or trying to legend music Prince, has also changed his name to a symbol and later, changed his name after another artist to Prince.

The Star of Game Wang's anger is critical of toxic maleity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Sword Man Jon Snow in the TV series fiction medieval dramas full of violence, the Crown Game.
But the 31-year-old actor was quite angry with the prototype of this hero character and mentioned that the male characters on the screen would make young men feel that they had to be strong to earn respect.
Exchanged with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that 'there's something wrong here' and posed the question of how to solve the toxic male problem of the era #MeToo.
Kit recently married his friend who performed in the Power Game, Rose Leslie, aged 31, he admitted to feeling 'citation needed' to solve this problem.
'At this point, I personally feel like I don't know what we've done wrong with the so-called male thing?' he shared.
'What have we taught men as adults about the problems that are already ahead of us?'
Kit believes that television may also have a share of the responsibility for the growing toxic manhood of the extremely male characters they built.
He went on: 'What is the innate point and what is the characteristics of education?
What was taught on TV and on the street made boys feel like men's role models?
I think this is really a problem of this age - how do we change?
'Cause there's obviously something that doesn't make sense to our young men.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not be joining any other prehistory or foreign narrative division about the Power Game, after the series ended next summer, at the same time asserting that ‘the battle and the horses are tired.'
From November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard's True West remake film story of a film producer and brother, a thief.
The recent actor revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the most wonderful thing when he decided to stop closing the Crown Game.
'I've met my wife in this series, that's where my future family and my life goes from here on out,' he said.
Rose plays the Dyer, the lover of the Jon Snow character that Kit played in the fake series won this Emmy Award.
The couple held the wedding in June 2018, on the Leslie family estate campus in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China Reports new infected population increases 14%
China has just announced the number of citizens in the country living with HIV and Airds has increased by 14%.
Medical officials say that the country has more than 800,000 people with this disease.
In the quarter of 2018 alone, the number of cases of infection was recorded as 40,000.
The vast majority of new infections are caused by sexually transmitted diseases.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV under this route has dropped almost zero. This is the statement of Chinese medical officials at a conference in the province of Dunge Nam.
However, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China annually has increased by 100,000.
Infection of HIV via sex is a serious problem that is taking place in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has ceased to be considered illegal in China since 1997, in practice, discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Due to the traditional values of the country, the study estimated that 70-90% of men would eventually marry, despite having developed sexual relations with men.
Many people are infected with a century-old disease due to a lack of adequate protection from same-sex sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to giving HIV medication to all infected patients to deal with the disease.
Mrs. Maxine Waters denies her staff's exposure to Republican Senators' data, highlighting 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiratory'.
On Saturday, U.S. Democratic Representative Maxine Waters, has dismissed the charge that a member of her staff has posted personal information from three Republican senators on Wikipedia's Wikipedia page about legislators.
The Democratic Party in Los Angeles asserts that these complaints are due to the "company" experts and the websites.
"Police, lies and lies are even more ignoble," Waters wrote in an article on Twitter.
Reportedly, leaks include private home address and phone number for U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from the state of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
This information began to appear online on Thursday, by an unidentified person at Capitol Hill Hall during the time of the Senate hearing on the charge of sexual assault against the candidate for the Supreme Court's office of Brett Kavanaugh.
This information was revealed shortly after these three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill wrote: Website sites such as Gateway Pundit and Red Sport report that IP addresses identify the origins of articles related to Mrs. Waters' office and reveal information about one of Mrs. Waters' staff.
Mrs. Waters went on to say: "This baseless garment is completely false and absolutely a lie".
"The staff in my office have been violated identity, personal information and also the safety of these false and false allegations cannot be found that the person who has revealed such information.
This baseless charge is completely false and absolutely a lie."
This statement of Mrs. Waters immediately attracted online criticism, including the former Press Secretary of the White House, Mr. Ari Fleischer.
"Absolutely rejects this expression of anger" Fleischer wrote.
"This shows she had no chi to become a parliamentary commissioner.
When someone is accused of an act that they do not do, one should not become angry.
They were not challenged.
They were not to question the motive of the person who presented the charges.
They must show calmness and clarity."
Fleischer seems to be comparing Waters' response to Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to Democrats criticism and critics also accuse him of being overly angry in the Thursday hearing.
Omar Gorbachev, a Republican candidate who was running for Waters during the mid-term election, also expressed views on Twitter.
"Big if true" (It's going to be big if it's true), he wrote on Twitter.
Mrs. Waters stated that her office had warned "the authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
"We will ensure the perpetrators will be brought to light," she went on to say "and they will be responsible for all possible harm and danger to any of my employees."
Rating Johnny English Remixed the gang - Rowan Atkinson's funny useless spy
Now, a rather traditional trend in any new film has a British element of finding meaning of Brexit, and the next episode of the comedy series-acting on spy Johnny English was also no exception.
Would the act of making fun of ourselves about how useless we are to become new exports for this country?
In any event, agent Johnny English has limited powers with round eyes and flexible facial muscles that are allowed to mess things up again - his name is simply representing a comic work designed for non-English-speaking areas.
Of course, he was a secret active agent, although he always pretended oddly in the style of Inspector Buckingham, mixing Mr Bean's humor and a little something contributing to the Chariots theme tune of Fire in the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
The character's prototype is also based on the tourist and the international mystery man Atkinson who has once starred in the television commercial Barclaycard has now sunk into forgetfulness and caused chaos when he wakes up.
There are some interesting scenes in the latest Johnny English episode.
I liked the scene Johnny English approached the helicopter while wearing the medieval armour and the propellers beat on his hat.
Although Atkinson's humor is fully expressed, the funny element here seems to be inadequate and somewhat surplus, especially when the film brands are "serious" such as the 007 series and the impossible missions have left the comedy to be just a type of spice.
The funny element of this film can only make children laugh, and I personally consider Johnny English's silly mistakes to be nothing creative and notable as the jokes in the silent film Mr. Bean of Atkinson.
The situation leading the story is that England is in serious trouble.
The hacker has infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents operating outside, leading to the spiritual loss of a mission agent, a very regrettable little role by Kevin Eldon.
This is the Prime Minister's final option, a proud and strong character, currently facing this right-wing political crisis: Emma Thompson has shown very well the version character of this Prime Minister Teresa May, but according to the script she doesn't have much land to perform.
Intelligence advisors report that the identity of all active agents has been revealed and you will have to mobilize a retired agent.
And that person, Johnny English, is now teaching in a rural area, but in reality is teaching lessons outside the program to become secret agents: there are some pretty interesting jokes here, because English teaches students to be spies in the Rock Academy style.
English was summoned back to the Whitehall Court emergency meeting and reunited with the poor former Bough assistant, played by actor Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, asking for a ride to a luxury submarine commander, Vicki Pepperdine takes the role of a little waste of this talent.
So the Batman and Robin doubles were in trouble with the Queen's Order to return to duty and meet Olga Kurdlenko as the beautiful spy Aleksey Bulltoeva.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger under the curse of the charming technology billionaire after claiming he can solve every headache about the British computer: Jason Volantis, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began the adventure with fictional clowns: after disguised as waiters, they burned a French restaurant in a flash of an eye; causing chaos on Volta's luxury yacht; and English made even more confusion as they sought to use the hearing ear the virtual reality of polling Volta's home.
At the end of the film, the tight knots will be removed, but the excitement is quite similar to the TV channels for children.
It's a pretty trivial work.
And like the other Johnny English films, I can't help asking: is it really impossible for the film industry to give Rowan Atkinson a fair, worthy of your talent?
The Labour Party rejects the building information to allow the British people to work for four days but receives a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party will consider a radical plan, allowing the British people to work for four days///////////////////////////////////////.
According to information, the party wanted the business owners to transfer their savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the workers by giving them one more day off.
That would mean that the staff had a three-day weekend but still received the same salary.
Sources say this idea 'consistencies' with the party's economic agenda and is expected to increase support for the country's laborer.
The British Union Conference confirmed that turning to work for four days///////////////////] was a way for workers to enjoy the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: 'Overview of the policy plans will be announced by the end of this year.
'This goal cannot be made in short time, but working four days//Jan is a desire to fit this party's agenda in re-investigating the economy that benefits the laborers as well as the party's shared industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse this idea. The British Green Party is committed to working for four days///////50 in the 2017 campaign.
However, the idea has not yet been passed by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: 'The policy of working four days/////50 is not party policy and the party currently does not consider this policy.'
Dark Prime Minister John McDonnell took advantage of the Labour Conference last week to increase his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain his power from the 'untitled Advocates' and 'profits' at utility services companies.
These plans of the Dark Prime Minister also mean that the current shareholders in water companies may not get his full share back because the government of the Labour Party can apply 'districts' based on behavior is considered wrong.
He also confirmed the plan for the laborers to join the company's board and set up a comprehensive equity fund to give 10% of the share of private companies to the company employees, from which they were able to receive the antiques annually to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy shared in the "60 Minutes" show on whether the FBI's investigation results on Kavanaugh caused them to change their decision.
The FBI's investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote to appoint him to the Supreme Court's office for at least one week and posed the question that the investigation results of the Federal Intelligence Bureau could cause any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In a radio interview on Sunday, the television reporter "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find some evidence that would make these senators change their decision.
Mr. Kennedy is more open-minded than his co-author from South Carolina State.
"I suppose of course," said Mr. Kennedy.
"I said in the hearing, I traded with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, which is after the charge was brought up and asked, "Did you do it?"
He responded with firmness, determination, and determination."
However, Graham's vote seemed to have been absolutely certain.
He said, "I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and there's only one powerful charge that makes me change".
"Professor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett denied very strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people she gave her name can't verify the story.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any change in anything."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it contribute to the removal of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will post the Global Citizen Festival, a annual music event with the participation of an impressive star body to carry out an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
In the seventh year of this event, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, was an extension of the Global Demurishment Project, an international campaign group in hopes of ending poverty by increasing the number of active people who fought against poverty.
To receive free tickets to this event (unless you are willing to pay for your VIP ticket), the music night attendee must complete a series of tasks or "actions" as volunteers, e-mailing a world leader, calling or any other meaningful form to help raise awareness of the goal of reducing poverty.
But how has this Global Citizens Festival achieved success, when there are only 12 years left to reach the goal?
Is the idea of giving tickets to a free music night for people a practical way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another form of "The keyboard movement" - people feel they're making real difference by signing online petition or sending a post on Twitter?
As of 2011, the Global Citizen Organization has stated that over 10 million "actions" from the noted advocate, prompts a range of different goals.
They say that these actions have helped prompt world leaders to offer the same commitments and policies as over 37 billion dollars was set up to take steps to improve the lives of more than $2,25 billion in 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements derived from the group's actions, with at least $10 billion that had been paid or raised.
The group estimated so far, funds have been guaranteed to have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, an organization that includes investors and performers, pledges "helping children to reach their full potential," promising to give Rwanda $25 million to help put an end to malnutrition in this country after receiving over 4700 Twitter posts from the Global Citizens group.
"With support from the British government, sponsors, national government and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice to a state of malnutrition into a historical mark," the Ambassador of Nutrition Power, Concert Ullman shared with audiences in a live show in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 acts of appeal for the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for the mother and child, the government has announced funding for a project called Nutrition Power, which ensures nutrient intervention for five million women and children.
Answer to one of the usual questions on the group's website "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizens Group replied: "This will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fail.
But just like civil rights and anti-cultural movement before, we're going to succeed because together, we're going to be stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is a number of artists who will participate in the event of this year in New York, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy to "published" Russia exports power - Home Minister
The Washington Cramer directs U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke to reveal: Washington could mobilize Navy forces "if necessary" to prevent the Russian power source being brought into the market, including the Middle East market.
Zinke accused that Russia's involvement in Syria - more notable than at the invitation of the legitimate government - is only an excuse to probe the new energy market.
The man reportedly said: "I believe that the reason they invaded the Middle East was because they wanted to trade energy as in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe".
And according to official news, there are many ways and measures to prevent this.
He said: "U.S. is capable of using Navy forces to ensure that the seam traffic is still open and will be closed, when necessary, to ensure that their power source is not brought into the market".
Zinke has called the attendees to the event organized by the Useer's Energy Alliance, a self-sustaining non-profit group that is "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's methods with Russia and Iran, at the same time noting that the two methods were equally effective.
"The economic case that Iran and Russia can choose is to take advantage of and change the fuel type," he said, while calling Russia "the one with only one strength" with the economy based only on fossil fuels.
The claims were made when TT. Trump's administration was seeking to increase natural gas exports to Europe, which were intended to replace Russia's position, which was much cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the TT. Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Northern Nord Nord Nord Stream 2 "unsuited" that, according to Mr Trump, led Moscow to "complete control" Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Northern Nord Stream Oil Project 2 is worth $11 billion, which is built to double its current capacity of 110 billion cubic metres and this is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that harsh opposition from Washington's side to this project simply stems from economic reasons and is an example of unhealthy competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers must be chosen providers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after the meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American stance caused a violent reaction from the German side, after which the country reasserted its commitment to participate in the project.
Germany's top industrial organization, the German Industrial League (BDI), has appealed to the US not to interfere with the energy policy of the European Union, as well as parallel agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I must face a major problem when a third country tries to interfere with our power supply", Garland Kempf, president of the German Industrial League (BDI) said after the meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to look into the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts State Senator said,
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "gravely consider" the presidential election after the mid-term election.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running for office.
The Hill led her to say: "It's time for women to go to Washington and fix government error, and so need a woman at the top".
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump in the town hall meeting and said he was "taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm really worried about what Donald Trump would do to our democracy," she said.
Mrs Warren strongly criticized Trump and the man he nominated for the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In an article on Twitter on Friday, Mrs. Warren said "of course the FBI has to investigate before voting."
However, a Thursday survey revealed that the majority of Mrs. Warren's voters did not suggest that she should run in 2020.
According to the poll results conducted by the Suffolk University Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of voters "may" of Massachusetts State said Senators should not run for office.
32% supported her for running.
The poll revealed that many voters supported former Governor Deval Patrick out-election, with 38% of the voters supporting and 48% of the voters protesting.
Other potential candidates of the Democratic Party were named when referring to the 2020 presidential elections that included former Vice President Joe Biden and State Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported Mr Biden that he would make an official decision prior to January.
Sarah Palin gives evidence of post-depression disorder (PTSD) of Trace Palin at Donald Trump's campaign
Tracek Palin, 26 years old, served 1 year in Iraq after enrollment in September.
You were arrested and charged in a domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through when he returns, I can entirely think of other families also suffering the consequences of the Chandra syndrome and the injuries that our soldiers carry when they return," she said in front of the crowd at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the capture of his son "a clear but unintended issue" and claimed that his son and other veterans returned from the war "there was change, more thorny, and wondered whether there was respect for them and their comrades, the Air Force and all the other members of the army because of what they had given to this country."
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday at Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing others from reporting domestic violence and possession of arms while drunk.
18 states and D.C. advocates the challenge of new refugee policies
Eighteen states and District of Columbia are in favor of challenging the new U.S. policy to refuse asylum for victims who flee from the gang or domestic violence.
NBC News broadcasts representatives of 18 states and D.C. sent a short group text on Friday in Washington to support refugees who objected to this policy.
The full name of the plaintiffs in the Grace and Sessions vs. Grace and Sessions which the U.S. Civil Freedom League filed in August to protest federal policy has not yet been revealed.
She said her lover "and the son of the members of his violent gang" abused her but the American officials refused to request her asylum on 20 July.
You're being held in Texas.
The prosecutor of the states in favor of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there was a large number of people who applied for asylum in the United States as when countries faced problems of gangs and domestic violence quite common.
The new U.S. refugee policy went against the 2014 decision-making decision of the Distinguished Revenue Council that allowed immigrants with no identity papers to flee from domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General of Columbia Karl Racine stated on Friday that the new policy "disregarded the state, federal and international law system that had been for decades."
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered based on specific facts and circumstances of the requester and the policy of this obstruction violates that principle," said the brief report.
The prosecutors also argued in short text that the policy of refusing immigration damaged the U.S. economy, because immigrants were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "full of the necessary labor resources."
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the registered immigration judges not to continue to allow asylum to victims who fled from the domestic violence and abuse of the gang in June.
"Only to allow asylum with those who leave their country due to oppression or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political opinion," said Mr. Sessions in a policy release on 11/06.
Violence has never been the measure of reducing all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face daily around the world.
The rescue efforts in despair in Palu as the number of dead doubled in the search for survivors
For survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly disastrous.
"It's really stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who shares while patting on her son who is suffering from a fever at an evacuation centre in the desperate city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance carries more bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
The people returned to their destroyed home, picking up supplies in the water, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of injured people and hospitals were completely overloaded, after the damage caused by a massive 7.5-degree earthquake of richter.
Some were injured, including Dwi Haris with a broken back and shoulder resting outside Palu Military Hospital, where the patient was treated outdoors due to the continuing aftershock.
His tears came out when he recalled the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the five-story hotel room he was with his wife and daughter.
"We don't even have time to save ourselves.
I suppose I've been thrown into the wreckage of the wall," Haris told Associated Press and added that his family came to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying and crying for help, but then I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to my wife and children.
Hope they're all safe."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of 'raping' with 'pronounced propaganda'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page commercial on an American newspaper referring to the general interests of American-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press for propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to an additional China Daily fund for Des Moines Registration - Iowa's Best Seller Press - after the Chinese allegations of trying to intervene in the American parliamentary election on November 6, China dismissed the charge.
TT. Trump's allegations of Beijing's attempts to intervene in the American election marked a new phase in an enhanced campaign for Washington's China pressure under what American officials shared with Reuters.
Although the fact that foreign governments set commercial promotions is perfectly normal, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in the escalation of the war, with evidence that they have imposed high tax levels with the imports of both parties.
Chinese and American experts say that Chinese tariff policy for retaliation in the early stages of war was designed to target exporters in the states supporting the Republican Party of TT. Trump as Iowa State.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador in China and a longtime governor of Iowa State, state exporting large agricultural goods to China, says Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and American businesses.
Branstad wrote an opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, saying that China "is continuing that bullying behavior by running propaganda ads on our own free paper."
"In an effort to spread propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the U.S. free speech and press tradition when placing a payment ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the newspaper stalls on Beijing's streets, you rarely find any disagreeable views and will not find any genuine reflection of the Chinese differing opinions of China's difficult economic orbits, because clearly the media are in full control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also supplemented that "one of the most popular newspapers in China had avoided the offer of posting" his article, although he did not specifically say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warned Republicans that female voters were alienating before the mid-term election with Kavanaugh's incident
When many Republican party heads stand up for the candidate for the position of Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh before a few sexual assault charges, analysts warn that they may have to face fierce reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term election.
The emotions surrounding the incident were quite strong and most Republican candidates on the running list expressed that they wanted to continue voting.
There are things we can't do again," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell College of Syracuse told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Mr. Reeher said that he didn't think that Senator Jeff Flake (Bang R-Arizona) pressed the agreed button for the FBI to conduct enough investigation to ease angry voters.
The Washington newspaper, D.C. directed Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and National Speaker of the Team Progress On Friday: "Woman won't forget what happened yesterday - tomorrow they won't forget and until November they won't forget".
Mic Herald: On Friday morning, protesters shouting "January 11 is coming!" as parades on the Senate's corridor as the Republican Party is taking control of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue to vote for Kavanaugh nomination despite Professor Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
"Statement and democratic motivation will be pushed higher than ever," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst sharing with news page.
"It is said that the motivation is now very high; it is true.
But even higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29 usually don't vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Mrs. Ford publicly sworn on the details of the charge of sexual assault against the Supreme Court official's candidate, analysts suggested that the public might have a violent reaction if the Republicans continued to confirm.
NBC News referred to Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee chairman said last week: "This may become a mess the Republicans have to solve".
"The problem is not just the vote of the committee or the official vote, or whether Kavanaugh becomes the Supreme Court Justice, but the more important issue is how Republican parties handle this institution and how they treat the accused," said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, the party supporting the Democratic Party of election, telling the news channel.
However, the American people had a disagreement about whether to believe in Mrs. Ford's testimony or Mr. Kavanaugh's testimony, which seemed to be more suspicious of Mr. Kavanaugh.
A new poll held by YouGov showed 41% of the people who responded firmly or could believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were sure or could trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of the people who answered thought Kavanaugh might or certainly have lied when giving testimony, while only 30 percent claimed that Ford was sure or might have lied.
After Flake pressed the conclave button, the FBI was conducting an investigation into Mrs. Ford's allegations and at least one other chargeer, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian delivered the news.
Ford took an oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was drunk, when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court judge's candidate to reveal his genitals in front of her when they attended a party during their academic term at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventors plan to start building new Internet to pick up Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, is currently launching a startup project, which aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.

The company called it "the right to control the data for individuals."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of the Inrupt project is to ensure that the company is armed with resources, procedures and skills suitable to help provide Solid for everyone.
The company currently has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have signed the contract to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own unfocused applications by the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his group did not discuss with "Facebook and Google about whether or not the incident would change completely because all their business models were fully able to upgrade after one night.
"We don't need to ask their permission."
In an article on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote "The mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to preserve integrity and the quality of the new site built on Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web (January Global) Association at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been the influential name in the debate on the neutrality of the internet.
Despite the release of the Inrupt Project, Berners-Lee will continue to assume the role of the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web, Web Foundation Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Memorial of Rabbi Bernard Vann receiving the Victoria Cross Medal in World War 1.
The 100-year anniversary of the only Church of England Rabbi was awarded the Cross of Queen Victoria during the First World War as a warrior held in his hometown.
Reverend Commander Bernard Vann won the Medal on 29 September, 1918 during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he died of snipers four days later and himself never knew he had won the British Army's highest Medal of Honor.
On Saturday, his two nephews revealed a memorial stone during the March of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of these nephews, Michael Vann, said that this was "a glorious symbol" when the stone was exhibited exactly 100 years after the war that helped his grandfather win the medal.
According to the London Press, on 29 September 1818, Commander Vann commanded his battalion across Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog, under heavy fire from rifles and machine guns."
He then plunges straight into the line of fire and with the "excellent feeling", he leads the battalion upward, before rushing into a rifler and knocks down three Rangers.
Lieutenant Commander Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 18 - just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that grandfather's actions were "actings that I could never do myself, but there was humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann also placed a crown after the Royal Brentwood Young Band Parade in the lead.
Michael Vann said that he felt "absolutely honored to be in the parade" and "the bravery of a true hero will be recorded by the support of so many."
The martial arts fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but they ended up getting only Peppa Pig
Imagine that you have been up all night waiting to see Bellator 206 with a packed audience, but have ended up being rejected for the main event.
The introduction from San Jose stated that there were 13 matches, including six on the main card and were featured directly throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., as soon as Gegard Mousasi and Rory Ahmad were about to fight, viewers in England were stunned when the screen turned to Peppa Pig.
Some feel that they are not respected after they are awake to watch the game.
A fan shows on Twitter that turning the show into a children's cartoon is like "a no-go-no-show joke."
"The government stipulates that the martial arts content shines at 6:00 a.m. is not appropriate, so they must be converted into a program for children", Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president of Bellator in charge of marketing and media said when asked about the transfer of this program.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
The president of Bellator Company, Scott Coker said that they were considering their broadcast schedule to ensure that the British audience could see future shows.
Mr. Coker said, "I think if we play it again, we can solve the problem".
"But it's 6 a.m. Sunday morning and we can't handle the problem until Sunday on our time zone, but it's Monday on their time zone.
But we're trying to find a solution.
Trust me, when people change the show, there's a lot of messages around and those messages aren't very friendly.
We tried to fix it, we initially assumed it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't, it was government regulations.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of games down to five, instead of six games as expected—years are the number of games we usually give and we've tried to give over to fans.
This is a real unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Bad Mutua' on Sexual Reforms
Olympic dancer Tom Daley shares that when he grew up, he always felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual tendencies - but that was his successful motivation.
Twenty-four-year-old athletes share you don't realize "you're not like anybody" until you study in school.
Communications in the Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 led by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had voiced himself about the rights of gays to bring "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The host of this long-time rice show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off to relieve himself.
In the first issue led by the Lorrie, Daley appears as an abandoned person, saying that he feels "bad" for everyone, because "his sexuality is not socially accepted as a clear son and daughter."
He said, "To this day, the feeling of myself being inferior and different still exists, becomes the motivation and the strength that I can succeed."
You want to prove that you've had "something" that people won't be disappointed to know the truth about your sexual orientation.
The former two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an active athlete for the LGBT community and he uses his image at the general Agricultural Sports Conference in Australia this year to appeal to more countries against discrimination against homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he felt very fortunate to be able to open up without being distinguished and want to give hope to others.
The three-time World Championship shares that he loves a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black.
Daley was married to this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference was never a barrier between the two.
"When you have to go through so much pain as a child" — he entered the Olympic Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later — it's going to be hard to find someone of the same age as all those experiences in his life.
The couple became the parents of the boy Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley saying that both his "view world" changed.
"If you asked last year, my goal was 'I must win the gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was that they had got tickets to the Olympics in London in 2012 not - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you 'I can't sit in the front row anymore'," he said.
"I hold his hand when he takes his last breath and even until he stops breathing and goes away forever, I still can't admit that he must be invincible".
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I only know that it's my life's dream - jumping in front of the cheerleaders at the Olympic Olympics, really there's no greater feeling than that," he said.
This was also an inspiration for him to select the first song - Heather Small's Proud - the song that co-edicipated him during his training towards the Olympic Olympics and still touched him every time he heard it again.
The Desert Island Discs broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST, Sunday.
Mick Robertson lacks style on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday.
American player Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to raise the style to avoid this record becoming a sad experience.
Mickelson played in the event held twice this year but Captain Jim Furyk left him in the bench in the Fourball and Foursome series on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action as in the United States, the five-time goalmates who won this victory had to spend the day as a cheerleader and play the game in hopes of getting rid of the discomfort.
The 48-year-old goalkeeper with the field is that the touchdowns on the plane have never been the ideal choice for the narrow LeKen National golf course, even when he is at the height of the stature, because the wrong hits here will have serious consequences.
And if this golf field isn't enough to haunt, Mickelson still has to compete for the 9th game on a Sunday with his opponent as the United Kingdom Champions' Championships' Openings of Krishna Molari during this week, Molari catches up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and wins all four games.
If the American team, currently losing four points before starting a series of 12 single matches, wants to start in a dramatic way, Mick Heson's match is of utmost importance.
Furyk expressed confidence in his golfer and did not speak too much.
"He fully understood his role today, he patted me on the back, put his arms around me and said that he would be ready for tomorrow" Furyk said.
"He's very confident.
He is a legend and has contributed extensively to the team, in the past and throughout the week.
I may never have imagined him playing two games.
I imagine more, but that's how it works and we think that's the right way.
He wants to compete, like all the other teammates."
This Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record, becoming the most gamer in the Ryder Cup.
It could also be the milestone of his career ending at the Ryder Cup because the peaks in his personal record never appeared in this tournament.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and tiers, although Furyk thinks his presence brings invisible value to the team.
"He's funny, he's satirical, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people." he explained.
"I think young golfers are also happy to see him and this week is also quite fun.
What he offers is more than competition."
The European team captain Thomas Bjorn knew that the leading advantage could quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the head of the European team, had the experience that even though his team took a lot of lead when he entered the end-of-the-season solo matches, the result could have been easy to reverse in a way that was not pleasant.
The Dane began to compete in 1997 at Valderrama, in which their team, under the lead of Seve Ballesteros led by five points ahead of the American team but ultimately won the star-to-back with a score of 14-03-13.
"You always have to remind yourself that we used to lead a lot in Valderrama; we used to lead a lot in Brookline and we lost, in Valderrama, we won, but it was very hard" Bjorn said, with the look on the face that was imagining after watching the Battle of 2018 with a 5-3 win on Friday and leading 10-6 yesterday on the Le Mater National Field.
So history will show me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
You still have to concentrate tomorrow.
It's good to go out and fight.
The tournament is not over when the score is not yet on the board.
We have the goal of winning this year's trophy and that's our focus.
I always say I focus on my 12 golfers, but we also understand the power of your team - they're the best golfers in the world."
Glad to see the performance of his golfers on the golf course, Bjorn added: "I'll never say anything in advance.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow is the performance of each individual and will certainly be very different.
It would be great to play in pairs and everything would work out, but when you compete in individual games, all the skills of a golfer will be revealed.
It's the message you have to share with every goalkeeper, that they must be ready to compete best tomorrow.
Now a pair must split up and each of them must be ready for the best."
In contrast to Bjorn, the captain of the opponent's team, Jim Furyk again expects his golfers to show better personal ability than when played in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won three of the four points.
Furyk himself had experienced both directions in the major turning points on the last day, having been a winning team member at Brookline before failing while the European team was hailed as "The Color of Medah."
"I remember every word," he said when asked about Ben Crenshaw, captain of the team in 1999, having gathered and encouraged the goalkeepers before the final day of the match.
"We have 12 major games tomorrow, but you'll want to start as quickly as you see in Brookline, or as you see in Medah.
As the result follows a trend, the matches in the middle will be under a lot of pressure.
We built the formation that way and sent the golfers out to the field strategically and tried to make the feat tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with leading the team and facing Rory McIroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pouler, other European golfers in the first series.
"I chose this group, in that order because I believe it's the way to pass," Bjorn said about the choice for his single match.
The new German warship continued to be delayed into use
Local media coverage: German Navy's newest destroyer ship was supposed to have tried in 2014 to replace the old warship of the Cold War, but it was not until the next year that it was possible to run a test due to error systems and increased costs.
Die Ze Zeit lead military spokesman: Operations Run "Rheinland-Palz", the lead ship of the destroyer completely new type Baden-Wuerttemberg, is currently delayed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the problems after delivery prevented this ambitious project.
Four of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-class destroyer.
This means that these ships will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of air-defensive and anti-boat missiles, some of the invisible technologies, such as reducing radar tracks, infrared and sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance time - can deploy the latest destroyers far from the national ports up to two years.
However, the continuing delay meant that these modern warships - were supposed to help Germany control the foreign countries - would become backward at the start of its use, the Die Zeit newspaper noted.
The unfortunate Falbert destroyer became the headline last year when the German Navy officially refused to test the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There is very little information about the reason behind the return of this ship, but German media refers to "subscription of software and hardware" seriously, leading to the battleship being completely useless if engaged in combat missions.
The software defects are particularly serious because the Baden-Wuerttemberg type ship will be operated by a fleet of 120 crews—with only half the manpower on the old Brewer-class destroyer.
At the same time, it can be seen that the ship's weight increases significantly, leading to reduced performance and limited the ability to upgrade in the future of the Navy.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz ship" weighed 7,000 tonnes which were said to weigh twice the same warship that the Germans used during World War II.
Apart from the hardware failure, the cost of the entire project - including crew training – is also a serious issue.
The project is said to have taken a significant capital team up to a €3,1 billion ($1.6 billion) - while the initial estimated cost is .002,2 billion.
The issue of mobilizing the latest destroyer ships became particularly important, in the recent context of German naval power warnings being narrowed down.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bellards, Chairman of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged the real Navy as "no battleships capable of combat."
The official stated that the problem was becoming more and more severe over time, since the old ship had ceased to function but had no alternate ships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships qualified to join the Navy.
National Trust has overheard the secret life of bats.
A new study is being conducted at a Scottish Highland site in order to reveal how bats use natural landscapes to hunt food.
Hopefully these findings will shed light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and navigate for future conservation activities.
The study was conducted by National Trust for Scotland's scientists, following the journey of popular bats, mosquito bats (soprano Pipes), brown-eared bats and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens Area in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the research grounds to monitor the activities of these bats throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using portable probes.
Audio analysts will conduct analysis of all recordings and determine the frequency of the bat and the purpose of broadcasting the sound of each specific bat genre.
The map and habitat report of the bats would then be established to have detailed paintings according to the natural landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS's natural conservation consultant, hopes the results will help determine what habitat has the most important role for bats and how species reside in that environment.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management activities, such as growing grasslands and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has significantly declined in the past century.
They are threatened by the construction and development activities affecting the bat's moorings and loss of habitat.
Wind bins and light systems, flytrap paper, certain chemical treatment methods for building materials, as well as the attacks of pet cats can also pose risks to bats.
Bats aren't completely blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, the ears are more useful than the eyes when stalking and catching prey.
They use a highly sophisticated echolocation technique to identify obstacles on flight routes.
NTS is responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha all over the country, and at the same time especially value bats.
The organization has ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, check and sometimes participate in animal rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave Lands in Dumfries and Galloways, which is home to eight of the ten bats of Scotland.
The land manager David Thompson said the land was their ideal territory.
"Threave is a great habitat for bats," he said.
"We have many old buildings, many great trees and good habitats.
But there's still a lot of mystery about bats, so the work here and in other facilities will help us understand what bats need to grow even more."
He emphasized the importance of having to test bats' lives before preserving in the grounds, because the unwitting destruction of their breeding grounds could kill up to 400 females and vomit, almost completely destroying the community.
Bats are protected species and killings, harassment, harassment, or destruction of their lentils are illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Batman Conservatives Officer, encouraged the community to join in helping.
She said, "We still need to learn more about bats and with many species, we can't know how far their communities are apart."
Ronaldo dismissed the charge of rape and his lawyer prepared to sue the German magazine.
Cristano Ronaldo said that sexual charges against him were "freaming" and that someone "wanted to profit" by his name.
His lawyer was prepared to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel for having posted this charge.
The Portuguese protagonist who currently plays for the Juventus team has been charged with raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday: The player is said to have paid this woman 375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
In the video live on Instagram before 142 million people followed hours after the charges were released, Ronaldo, aged 33, asserting that the report was "tradited news".
"No, no, no.
What they say today is all fake news", player five hits the title Golden Ball said in front of the camera.
"They want to take advantage of my name for profit.
That's just as normal as it is.
Say my name and they're famous, but that's just part of the job.
I'm a happy person and everything's fine," the male player added and smiled.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue the newspaper Der Spiegel on this charge, they call it "the inadmissible suspicion of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schetz said this player would require compensation due to "the moral damage to the amount of money corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, possibly one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years."
The incident in the alleged charge occurred in June 2009 at a senior motel in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were alleged to have returned to the player's lounge, according to records at Clark County Court, Nevada, he was accused of raping her at the hotel.
Mayorga said Ronaldo was on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he "99%" was "good man", only "1%" was not good.
There are documents that Ronaldo confirmed that the two parties had sexual development, but were based on consent.
Mayorga also said that she had been to the police station and was photographed at the hospital, but she later agreed to compromise in court because she was "regulated of revenge" and worried about "disgraceded publicly."
This 34-year-old woman said that she is currently seeking to reverse her previous reconciliation decision as a result of her continuing to be hit by the incident in the charge.
At the time of the charges being made, Ronaldo was preparing from Manchester United to transfer to Real Madrid, but in the end this summer, he switched to playing for the Italian Giant Juve in the transfer agreement for 100 million dollars.
Brexit: You'll be forever sorry for losing your role as car producer
Business Minister Greg Clark stated: The United Kingdom "will be forever regrettable" if lost the world's lead position in the production of the Brexit rear car.
He also supplemented that quite "deposed" when Ahmad UK shared with BBC that if he left the European Union without further agreement, they would cease production at Burnaston's factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
Japanese automotive manufacturer says delays at the border in the case of Brexit without a deal could lead to a job loss.
Burnaston Factory - the production of Auris and Avensis of Bristol - produced nearly 150,000 of them last year, in which 90% of them were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My point is that if you completely left the European Union at the end of March we'd have to stop production at this factory", Marvin Cooke, executive director of Ahmad at Burnaston.
Other British auto manufacturers also raised concerns about Britain leaving the EU without a cross-border trade agreement, including Honda, Mustang and Bristol Land Rover.
For example, Bentley said they would close Mini Plants in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of automobile manufacturers is the risk of the chain supply in the case of Brexit without other agreements.
Bristol's production line operates in the principle of "just-in-time" (Juntime), with the parts being provided by the suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union delivering after every 37 minutes for the production lines by order.
If you leave the EU without any other deal on 29/03, there's a possibility of interruption at the border and this sector is concerned that it could lead to delay and a lack of spare parts.
Ahmad said the company couldn't keep the stock value for more than a day at Derbyshire plant, so they would have to stop producing.
Mr. Clark stated that the plans of Prime Ministers Theresa May for future relations with the European Union would be "inaccurately adjusted to avoid border inspections."
"We need to make a deal, we want to make the best deal, not just guarantee success in the present, but make sure we get this opportunity really good," he said in BBC Today.
"The evidence from Ahmad as well as other automobile manufacturers shows we need to ensure that the supply chain is successful."
Ahmad had not yet announced how long it would be to stop production, but in terms of the long term, they warned that further costs would reduce the competition of the plant and, in the end, the laborer would lose his job.
Peter Tatsuvallaris had worked at Burnaston for 24 years and was a rallyer of Unite unions at the factory, stating that his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience once I lost these jobs there was no more.
Government spokesman asserts: "We have built an accurate and reliable plan for future European Union relations."
The White House announced the meeting between TT. Trump and Mr. Rosenstein may be delayed again.
The White House announced on Sunday: TT's senior meeting. Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "a week from now" when the struggle over the candidate for Supreme Court seat Brett Kavanaugh was ongoing.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advisor Robert Ahmad, who is investigating the involvement in the Russian election, the link between TTC's assistants, Trump and Russia and the possibility of the president hindering the execution of justice.
Whether Trump fired Deputy Attorney General or not, pulling along was that it would be difficult for Ahmad to operate independently, having raised a lot of Washington rumors for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported Rosenstein discussing wearing headsets to record talks with Trump and the ability to deposit the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused to report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House among the rumors that he was about to resign.
Instead, his meeting with President Trump - who was then visiting the United Nations General Assembly in New York - was scheduled for Thursday.
President Trump said he "don't want" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with the Senate judiciary hearing between Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse had stood to testify.
On Friday, President Trump asked the FBI to spend a week investigating allegations against Kavanaugh, and at the same time continued to delay the Senate's full vote.
President Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "The undetermined meeting day, possibly during this week, can see the reason for this delay is due to other matters taking place at the Supreme Court.
But soon we'll get the news and the press will be updated."
Some reporters may disagree with the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked you about this.
Sanders said that the absence of press conferences was not due to a lack of interest in television reporters "too many stories", although she once said: "I also agree that reporters are actually a lot of stories."
She then suggested further direct contact between President Trump and the press.
"The president is currently making more response sessions than any previous president," she added without giving the evidence: "We've considered the number of press conferences."
Sanders said that there would still be press conferences but "if the press had a direct opportunity to ask the President of the United States, that would be much better than talking to me.
We've tried so hard and you've also seen that we've had a lot to do in the last few weeks, which will replace a press conference when you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
President Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when participating in open session sessions or in press conferences when officials visit.
Press conferences are typically very rare.
This week, in New York, the President was supposed to have stated the reason but he appeared suddenly in a strange appearance in front of the press crowd.
The Health Minister wrote to the European Union staff who worked in the health industry in Scotland to talk about the fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to the European Union staff who work in the health industry in Scotland to express the gratitude of the nation and to expect staff to remain behind Brexit.
The Minister of Health Jeane Freeman sent a letter with a message that would resign within six months of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of England from the European Union.
The Scottish government is committed to supporting costs for certificates of residential status of citizens of the European Union who are working in the public service industry have been transferred.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During this summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union about Britain's withdrawal from the European Union continue to take place, the decision is expected to be put out this fall.
But the British government is also promoting preparations for the scenario that may not reach the deal.
I know this is a time of unrest with all of you.
That's why I'd like to remind you that right now I appreciate very much the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Furthermore, colleagues from the European Union have brought valuable experience and skills to help strengthen and improve medical services, and to benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would love you to stay."
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after head injury
Insidebacks of the Tennessee Tigers, Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after head injury in the 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Griffiths on Saturday, Mike Organ in Tennessee gave the news.
Head coach of the state of Tennessee, Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first round break.
"He runs towards the vertical edge and collapses," Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen right at the vertical line before putting him on the cane and taking him to further inspection.
A state official from Tennessee told Chris Harris at the WSMV Championship in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added "no detailed information on the level/strike" and the state of Tennessee is trying to figure out the timing of the injury.
Abercrombie, the second-year student of the Redcoats, first competed under the state of Tennessee after moving back from Illinois.
He had a total of five games on Saturday before being eliminated from the game and he had a total of 18 games this season.
Foreigners who buy real estate in the UK will be charged with higher taxes
Foreign buyers of estate in the UK will be charged with higher taxation, this extra amount will be used to help the homeless under Tory's new policies
This change will nullify the success of Corbyn's young electoral efforts
The increase in taxes will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this policy to increase up to £20 million per year - to help the homeless
Foreign purchases of real estate in the UK will be charged with higher taxes - this additional increase will be used to help the homeless, Prime Minister Theresa May will announce today.
This change will nullify the success in Jeremy Corbyn's young attempt to attract voters with a cheaper housing commitment and target high-income subjects.
The increase in taxes will be applied to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, the additional amount of money that will spur the government's efforts to combat the current delay.
Compensation - aside from the current tax rate, including higher tax levels were released two years ago for the second house and houses purchased only so that - probably up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this change to increase to £20 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new estate built in London has been sold to non-British citizens, which makes housing prices higher and makes home buyers increasingly difficult for the first time.
Many of the country's rich areas – especially in the capital – have become "a ghost town" because most foreigners buy houses that spend most of their time in other countries.
The new policy was given just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help many young people have the opportunity to own their first home.
He accused major construction companies of holding high property prices by taking the land but not using it, he urged Prime Minister May to give up the quota for affordable houses to remedy the "home disaster" in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn also released a series of housing reforms intended to attract voters, including the control of renting and the closure of the "without error" expulsions.
He also wanted to give councils more power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: "I said last year that I would devote my tenure to restoring the British dream - that life would be better for the new generation.
And that means we have to regulate the housing market that's very chaotic right now.
England will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
This does not mean, however, that people who do not live in the UK and companies based abroad can easily purchase homes as hardworking British residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of having a house has become too far away and the delay is still very large."
Jack Ross: 'My last hope is to lead the Scottish team'
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross said that his "last ambition" was to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
Scot, 42, is facing the challenge of reviving the Northeast Club, currently holding third place at League One, less than three points in the first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Division last season.
"I want to compete for my country as a player..
I had the hat with the B-word logo and that's exactly what I wanted, "Ross told Sportsund of the BBC Scotland.
"My five months of childhood are tied to those Scottish matches that took place at Hampden with my father, and that's always what I remember.
However, that opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing the club."
Sunderland's predecessor managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam McLarenyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach said that he did not feel the pressure to be the successor to great names at such a large club, he had earlier turned down the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Be successful with me at this point will be judged by 'Can I bring the club back to the Premier League tournament?'
The organizational and material structure at this club is certainly part of the Premier League, "he said.
"This is not a mission to achieve easily, but I only consider myself successful if I can get the club back in the league."
Ross has only had three years as manager, after a while as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in training roles at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover the position after falling to third place, and gave St Mirren from the risk of falling out to be the next season champion.
Ross said he now felt very comfortable during his career playing football at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a real turning point," he recalled in the role of leading Alloa.
"I really believe I am more suited to the role of manager than to a player.
This sounded odd because I was quite successful, had good income and achieved certain achievements as a player.
But the game is often not easy.
There's a lot of things you have to face every week.
I still have to put up with the stress and pressure of my work, but I am satisfied with the management work.
I've always wanted to do management and now I'm doing it, I'm most comfortable being myself during my adult life."

The summer's hot sun has increased sales for pubs that are struggling in the United Kingdom but has put extra pressure on the restaurant sequences.
According to statistics, pubs and bars have seen sales increase 2.7% in July - but sales at restaurants have dropped 4.8%.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory, combined the figures, stating: "NIN' and the British team's innings at the World Cup caused the sale trend of July similar to that of June, when the pubs increased by 2,8%, the restaurants became more heavily affected.
The sales at the restaurants were down 1.8% in June were worsening in July.
The pubs and bars specialize in drinks have the fastest rate of growth compared to declines in restaurants.
The pubs specialize in food are also affected by the heat, although not as serious as restaurants.
Looks like everyone just wants to go for a drink.
The sales of drinks at pubs and bars were managed to increase 6.6% in the month while sales of food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, who specializes in entertainment and hotel RSM says: "These results show the trend that we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of large social events or sports are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales at restaurants.
It is not surprising that the restaurants continued to have difficulties, earnings dropped 4.8% over the same period of the previous year while the cost pressure went up again and again.
Long-lived hot summers have taken place at the worst time for food providers, unknown in August when the weather is cooler, can improve the current situation."
The total sales growth rate at pubs and restaurants, including new open venues, is 2.7% in July, reflecting a halt to brand deployment.
Coffer Peach Traveler's sales supervisor for pubs, bars, and restaurants in the UK collected and analyzed the job efficiency data from 47 active groups, with sales combining over £9 billion, and that's the standard point of the industry.
One of five children has a secret social media account that their parents don't know about.
One out of five children - some in their 11-year-olds - have secret social media accounts that parents and teachers don't know about, surveys show
The 20,000 second grade survey results show that the number of "Insta virtual" pages has increased dramatically
News has raised concerns about the rise of pornography online
Twenty percent of students say they have a "private" account to show their parents.
A fifth of children - some children at the age of 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey with 20,000 secondary students revealed a rapid growth in the "President" accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing page.
The news has added concern that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students say that children use a "private" account without bad content to show to their parents, and also have their own account.
A mother chanced to find the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, and found a teenager calling for someone else to "rape me".
According to the Research of the United Kingdom's Immediates and Conference for Principals (HMC) at the Civil Schools, 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two records, and half of them admit to having their own account.
Director of HMC, Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be "a representative of the athletes" at the Scottish estate council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish track board as an unmanaged director at the annual meeting of the management agency.
Doyle was the most decorated trackr in Scotland, president Ian Beattie saw this change as a great opportunity for sports coaches to use her rich competition experience in international arenas over the past decade.
"Eildh is highly respected in the Scottish track community, United Kingdom and in the world, we are sure that the Scottish track will benefit greatly by electing her to the council," Beattie stated.
Doyle said: "I want to play the role of a representative of athletes and I hope I can actually contribute and help lead this sport in Scotland."

Advertising milk cleaners compares mothers with dairy cows that divide public opinion online
A company that specializes in milk cleaners divides public opinion online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with milked cows.
In order to mark the release of the product as being considered the "fairable milk absorber and does not cause the world's first noise", the company of consumer technology released an ad inspired by the satirical music video to express the freedom the new suction brought to the mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay following a song with the words: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail and "In case you don't realize it, this isn't a breast, they're my breasts."
The chorus goes on: "Small the milk out, suck the milk out, I'm feeding the kids, sucking the milk out, I'm milking my girls."
This ad, however, was featured on the company's Facebook page, which caused a lot of controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received much of the opposite reaction from the audience, many of the opinion that the ad took "the horror" of the dairy industry lightly.
"A bad decision to use cattle to promote this product.
Like us, they must also be pregnant and give birth to milk, except the calves are taken from their mothers within days after giving birth", a writer.
Elvie Milking Machine is in the privacy of the bra for breast (Elvie/Mother)
Another has commented: "This could hurt both the mother and the baby.
Yes, why not use it to advertise milk cleaners for breast-feeding mothers?"
Another commenter added: "This ad has nothing to do with it."
There are those who also defend advertising, a woman who admits that she finds the song "it's funny".
"I think this is a unique idea.
I'll buy myself one if I'm still breastfeeding.
Milking really made me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little crazy, but I understand its message.
This is a unique product," another remarked.
Another commented: "This is an interesting commercial targeting mothers who need milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and they feel like cows".
This is not an ad of praise or assessment of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they had danced with the milk absorber hidden in their bras.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women suck milk to breast feed that they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milker does not cause noise, has no string or pipe and is quietly lying inside the breast-feeding breast, enabling women to be free to move, carry the baby, and even go out while sucking milk.
Ana Balarin, Partners and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie milk absorber is indeed a revolutionary product, worthy of a bold introduction and promotes curiosity.
When we compare women with dairy cows, we want people to know about the milk-cooking product and related challenges, and at the same time to show a sense of humor and empathy for the freedom that the new milk-cooking product brings to the mothers.
It's not the first time that the Elvie milk cleaners have appeared on the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother and two children appeared on the NPR floor of the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a hut on the Texas border
The number of captive immigrant children has risen dramatically despite the number of monthly crossovers that have remained almost unchanged, partly due to the harsh arguments and policies presented by the Trump authorities that have made the process of bringing children to sponsors increasingly difficult.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been non-registers, and they are concerned that receiving an immigrant child can affect their own ability to stay in the United States.
The risk increases in June, when federal authorities announce that potential sponsors and other adult members of their family will have to take prints, and this data will be shared with the immigration agency.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Department of Heritage and Customs, testified in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for funding for minors without a guardian.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had never had a criminal record.
"Nearly 80% of the sponsors or members of the sponsor's family are both here illegally, and most of them have criminal records.
So we are continuing to judge these individuals," said Albence.
According to employees at refugee camps, in order to be able to handle the case quickly in relation to these children, officials have made new regulations requiring some sponsors to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, according to previous standards.
Many will appear through the video conference call, rather than being directly present, to plead for their legal standing before an emigrant judge.
Those who were tried were considered unfit to be sponsored would be deported quickly.
The longer the children are detained, the more they become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent behavior or attempt to escape, according to the staff at refugee camps and according to reports from the system in recent months.
Supporters say the concern is growing at a larger facility like Tornillo, where they see a child in trouble who is more likely to be ignored due to the size of the camp too large.
They added that bringing children to a city with refugee camps did not allow them enough time to prepare their minds or say goodbye to friends that could cause psychological harm that many children are suffering.
Syria offers the U.S. occupational force, France and Turkey withdraw from the country immediately
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Secretary Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to the country, although the Civil War had moved on to the eighth year.
Moualem, deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were on illegal Syrian soil, under the name of anti-terrorism forces, so "will be dealt with".
"They must withdraw from Syria unconditionally and immediately", he spread before the council.
Moualem emphasizes that "the battle against terror in Syria is nearing the end", has now more than 350,000 people have died since 2011, with millions having to leave their homes.
He stated that Damascus would continue "the war in this holy war until we cleared terrorist groups out of the entire Syrian territory" and "the illegal presence of foreign forces".
The US currently has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, specializing in training and mentoring both the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 infantry in its country that are being devastated by war.
On the matter of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions of the country before were good enough for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "pulling irrational fears" that prevented refugees from returning.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of refugees," he said.
"They're using political cards for humanitarian issues."
The US and the European Union have warned that there will be no restructuring aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a neutral area in the final rebel area of Idlib has created opportunities to promote political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces backed up by Russia into this province, which had three million inhabitants living in.
However, Moualem emphasized the agreement to have "a clear deadline" and expressed the hope that military action would target holy elements including warriors from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, which were the "will be removed" objects.
The envoy of the United Stfackan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee including the government and opposition members to draft the post-war constitution for Syria and open the way for the election.
Moualem set the conditions for the involvement of the Syrian government on this committee, he said that the work of the committee was limited only to "considering the terms of the current constitution" and warned not to interfere in elections.
Why Twilight Will Win the Second term
Logically, President Trump would win the re-election in 2020 unless the process of impeachment and scandals caused the end of the presidency before the deadline, as liberals were hoping.
This is obviously "the most dramatic of a presidency!".
So far no signs of hypothermia.
As of 2014, the ratings of the gold hour have doubled to 9,000 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News currently has 1,4 million viewers at a yellow hour, compared to 1.7 million viewers from four years ago, and the NSBC's "The Rachel Dawkins Show" show was at the top of the cable-class chart with more than 3.5 million viewers watching the main news report items.
"Although not understood, many are still attracted to as burnt-out animals", Neal Baer, who ran the television show "Descarted Survivor" by ABC, speaking of a cabinet clerk becoming president after an attack on the destruction of the Parliamentary Building.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Fonny Parts: and the book "Faw Hard Truths About Seineking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
She recalled her taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told you he was going to vote for Trump.
You asked why?
"He replied, "Because he made me laugh," said Ms. Scovell to me.
This is a really interesting thing in the context of chaos.
Of course, unlike what happened on TV, any action of Washington could decide the future of Roe v. Wade, or the reunion of immigrant families and the global economic situation.
Only a few television audiences have the privilege of choosing their channels.
Not only that, this is more appealing than the news item when you spend six hours watching a group of experts arguing about the use of Bob Woodward's "deep" information in the book "Fear," or Paul Manafort's penny bomb jacket for 15,000 U.S. dollars" ("a showy costume," The Washington Post newspaper wrote) and the implications in Stormy Daniels's overs oversurgery on President Trump.
I changed my view of Super Mario.
"One of the things he does is always bring you something new every night that makes it look like a reality television show", according to Brent Montgomery, the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of "Pawn Stars" when speaking of the actor and the unexpected developments in Trump's daily television show (such as fighting with N.F.L. or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a episode or you won't catch up with the trend.
I had a conversation this week with Fleiss, outside Kauai's northern shore house under the 80-degree heat, but he hid in his house to watch MSNBC while recording for CNN.
He was unable to leave the television screen especially when Brett Kavanaugh was having to submit to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the scale.
"I remember the days when we made those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me so.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside poured into the most intense mid-term election for the White House race.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th electoral district is witnessing a cash rain, due to the reorganization of the parliamentary district that caused the two appointees to run into the same seat.
The recent geopolitical reposition at Pittsburg County struck out Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is racing with Republican candidate Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which shares many territories with the new 17th District.
The main map was re-planned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were arranged for fraud in a favour of the Republican Party.
The new 17th district race has become a financial race between the party's major sponsorship organizations, the Democratic Party Committee on the Congressional Operations (DCC) and the Republican Party Committee on the National Operations (NRCC).
Lamb has been a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the election that was particularly followed in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The position had previously belonged to the Republican Party for over a decade and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators have a higher rating of the Democratic Party.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Republic of Dominica and Panama recognized Beijing, Washington made virtually no objections.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and the president had once owned a hotel in Panama until business partners fired Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the Ministry of State decided to summon the American foreign delegations from El Salvador, the Republic of Dominica and Panama due to "the recent decisions about not recognizing Taiwan", Heather Nauert, according to the statement of the spokesperson of the State Department earlier this month.
But the penalty was considered solely for El Salvador, which received US$40 million aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic support.
The punishments are proposed, including cuts of financial aid and visa restrictions for some of the subjects, which will cause major losses to this Central American nation that currently have high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings were taking place, North American and Central American officials delayed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic issues to re-organise a similar meeting last year that was once considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-July, senior officials had declared that they wanted to continue the conference, helping to end consideration of the penalty for the U.S. El Salvador.
The diplomats said that Vice President Mike Pence was currently planning to speak at the convention, which was planned in mid October, when the signal was taking administrative measures.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Republic of Dominica without any hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions with anonymous conditions.
Their information has been certified by an external analyst who has a close relationship with the authorities and also speaks anonymously.
History of Studies
The next bomb may be a report by Special Advisor Robert Ahmad of the justice obstruction of President Trump, which currently has a lot of evidence in the public record.
It is claimed that Mr. Ahmad is moving his investigation to the issue of co-operation between President Trump and Russia in the presidential election.
If there's a party change in Congress, President Trump will have a lot of difficulties in Congress, just before the time to prepare the campaign for voters, and even for those in the same party.
There are many issues, I don't mean the departure of President Trump is inevitable -- just like your peers in Europe.
All sides of the Atlantic Coast need to make choices and this will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if the West would also agree to fight back and support Morthius at Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter.
History revolves around such landmarks, and democratic unspoiled struggles will increase or delay.
The Americans faced some of these landmarks.
What happens if President Trump fires Second Justice Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Mr. Ahmad's investigation?
Rosenstein has been sitting in a fire since last year's report about his proposal for the President's secret recording and speculation that the president is not in line for office.
The information of the Times newspaper was inaccurate by Rosenstein.
"How would we react if F.B.I.'s new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or unfair - or if he confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the reliable allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
Above all, will we vote in the middle of our term for a Congress so that this agency will hold Mr Trump accountable?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will lose its power for a long time.
But I believe we will not fail, because I have learned my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish-born Czech who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied our home.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, she gave me the opportunity to light candles on the altar during the Sabbath.
With my legacy, how could I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans' optimism of Rangers before the encounter with Rapid Vienna
Rangers v. Rapid Vienna on Thursday, when they learn that winning before the Austrians, after the hit-up in Spain before Dartmouth Reilly at the beginning of this month, will give them the advantage to win their rights to the G-board of the Europa League Cup.
The knee injury prevented quarterback Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season until the 2-2 match with Dartmouth Merkers but he believed Rangers could use that as a pedal for the greater good.
"It's a good thing for us because Dartmouthrell is a strong team," said 31-year-old player.
"We were in the match with the faith we would win a point.
We could have won at the end of the game but the score was also a pretty good result.
They may well have played better in the first round but we fought back in the second round and had better manners.
Next Thursday, it will be an important match in Europe.
Hopefully we could win three points, but that would be a tough game because they had good results in the game before, but with fans' shielding, I'm sure we could get through and get good results.
Last year was a difficult time, I was injured and the changes in the club but I have a very good feeling right now.
The formation is good, the players have the same good attitude as the quality of good practice.
Hopefully we can continue further to reap a successful new season."
Women are so worried that they can't sleep due to retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants understand what they care about, few communicate with family members.
About half of Nationwide's participants said they had talked to their wives or husbands about long-term care costs
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't talk about this", Holly Snyder, the vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business said.
These are the steps to begin.
Talk to your spouse/husband and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't show your wishes first.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where and how to be cared for, as such options may be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial adviser: Your advisor may also help you to give the method of payment for those costs.
Your financial options for long-term care purposes may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, life insurance policies for cash value to help cover these costs or to buy insurance with your own money - as long as you have money.
Prepare well for legal material: Avoid possible legal battles.
There is a plan for health care so that you can assign a reliable individual to oversee the course of healthcare and make sure that experts adhere to your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
In addition, consider your financial authority.
You should select a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and make sure to pay your bills if you are not capable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your parents face medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
List those details so you're always ready.
"What if it's not just the financial issue? What if it's the doctor?" Martin asked.
"What kind of drugs are there?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Have you planned yet."

Federal prosecutors are offering the death penalty for the NYC terrorist attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are offering the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City that has killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is said to have used Home Depot's rental truck to make an attack on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting the pedestrian and cyclist on 10 October.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "voluntary" kills 8 victims and "voluntaryly" inflicts severe physical injury, according to the announcement of the death penalty proposal, which was filed in the District of New York.
Both charges could be sentenced to death, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury accused Saipov with a indictment of 22 counts including eight attempted murders, often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and charges of violence and the destruction of mechanical vehicles.
The attack called for "contact planning and preservation", the prosecutors said, in describing the way Saipov performed as "violent, cruel, and inhuman".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to Diego's family and friends Ahmad Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Lare Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian", as reported by the court.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the execution of the death penalty in New York County.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenberg couple were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a Romanian-born, showed no remorse after the attack, according to the court's documents.
He announced to the investigators that he felt okay about what he was doing, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS's video on the phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He did not plead guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys who represented Saipov, said that they were "completely disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the decision to execute the death penalty rather than accept a confession to life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the injury of this event to those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's group of defense lawyers had previously asked the prosecutors not to present the death penalty.
Conservative congressmen claim that NIGEL FARAGE must take responsibility for negotiations about Brexit
Nigel Farage announced to 'steal the people' in a protest at the Conservative Party Conference.
Former Ukip leader said that politicians had to 'feel the heat' from European Skepticists - because one of the members of the Prime Minister Theresa May suggested he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative Party advocate Peter Bone voiced during the march in Kazakhstan that the United Kingdom of England had come out of league right now if Mr. Farage was Secretary Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May as he attempted to reconcile the profound divisions between conservative parliamentaries, in favor of staying in the European Union, took part in a protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to retain the compromise plan between the attacks from the Brexit supporters, the supporters stay and the European Union.
The allies claimed she would be motivated by attempting to reach a deal with Brussels despite fierce reactions – and forcing European skeptics and labour parties to choose between his plan and 'the current state of chaos'.
Mr. Bone stated in the Leave Means Leave protest at Solihull that he wanted to 'red against the Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Farage should stay in the senate and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, now we may be out of league," he said.
Congressman Wellingborough added: 'I'll support Brexit but we need to protest the Chevores plan.'
He cited his objections to the European Union: 'We do not fight in the world wars to serve others.
We want to build our own laws.'
Mr. Bone rejects the proposal that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the league is entirely false.'
"Brexit's Conservative Party advocate Andrea Jenkyns is also present at the protest, stating to reporters: 'I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Not many people approve of the Chevores plan, the opposition will not vote for this plan, which often does not happen to our party, our activist, who is willing to appeal to the support of the people and vote for us in the first place.
Give up the Chevores plan and listen to the people.'
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: 'The prime minister holds his chair when they keep their promises to the people'
Farage said that the politicians had to participate in the protest to 'feel the heat' if they changed their decision to be made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of trust between us - people - and the political class," he said.
'They're trying to give up Brexit and we're here today to say 'we're not going to let you do that'.'
In a message to supporters, he added: 'I want to let the political class, who are intent on changing Brexit, feel the heat of the current situation.
'We are mobilizing the people, who have brought forth Brexit victory and we will never surrender until we become an independent, autonomous, and proud Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the supporters who remained had paraded through Bangalore before hosting a two-hour protest in downtown.
Some activists raise conservative party banners against Brexit after the group debut this weekend.
Labour Party Senator Lord Adonis, made fun of the Conservative Party on security issues they were facing when the conference opened.
"These are the people who once told us that they can control the CNTT system and all the technologies that give Canada, including free trade issues without borders in Ireland", he added.
'This is a complete farce.
Brexit was not a good thing, 'he added.
Warren plans to decide 'election' for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be determined to "elect president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe announces Massachusetts Democratic Party has spoken of her future when speaking at the town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, was re-election in November, in the race with GOP State Representative, Geoff Dieppe, who was co-author of the Massachusetts campaign of Trump in 2016.

The event that took place on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall since President Trump took office.
A attendee asked her about her plans to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for "woman to join politics to reform the government and need to have a female head."

The Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the World Championship after winning against Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Botellas clearly had an advantage over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes remained a strong team at the season.
From the starting point, Bots had a good start and a row over Hamilton to defend his position in the first two laps and make Vettel fight with his own teammates.
Vettel entered the first pit and abandoned Hamilton when he entered the track, a decisive act.
The Mercedes entered the pit after Vettel, but Hamilton again rose to the front by the driver on the Ferrari who was forced to slow down to avoid the risk after two runs to protect the third position.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row line and came to seventh place when the turn ended exactly on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead during the race when he did not change the tires to get back to the goal quickly and passed Kimi Raikkonen to take the fourth place.
He eventually entered the pit in the 44th round but could not speed up the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen won fourth place.
It was a tough race because Valtteri was good at the weekend and it was a really good racer.
The team eventually had an outstanding race to win the number one and number two, "Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday campaign because she insisted that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford on the Supreme Court charges in the case of Brett Kavanaugh being sexually assaulted.
Speech in the West Virginia West Coast campaign, the president did not directly aim for the release issued by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "insulted and dishonest."
"What's happened and what's been going on in the past few days in the Senate is great, you can feel anger, you can see people who are angry, they're mean and they're unpleasant and dishonest", the president shares.
"When they saw the articles and read the leaks and they said "Oh, I'm not the one who did it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Lorrie Feinstein, did you leak the news?
Remember her answer... you leaked the material, right? - "Oh, my God, what's going on?
No, no.
I don't leak."
Now, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't do it," the president parodyd the senator's words.
Feinstein was sent by Ford in detail about the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information had been leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that her office leaked information.
"I don't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I don't leak her story,"Finstein said to the committee, The Hill delivered.
"She asked me to keep a secret and I kept it as secret as she asked."
But the President was not pleased with her refusal behavior and he commented in the Saturday night campaign: "I'll tell you about it, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by the three women, the president alleged that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain their power in every way.
You'll see meaning and discomfort because they don't care who will hurt, they want power and control," Mediaite led the president.

Air traffic controllers gave their lives to save hundreds of passengers on the plane from the quake.
Air traffic control personnel in Indonesia are being praised as a hero after dying to ensure that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers can take off safely.
Over 800 were killed and many were lost after a major earthquake occurred on Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The shocks continued to rage in the area and many were trapped in the wreckage in Palu City.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthinius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower shaking due to strong winds at Mutira Sies Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He stayed to make sure that the plane carried Batik Air Flight Flight Flight 6321, being on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the air control tower because he thought it collapsed.
He later died in a hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, stated that the decision saved lives, according to the ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalmantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he stopped breathing before the plane reached Palu.
"Our heart breaks when receiving this news," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the death toll may rise to thousands, the spokesman for the National Disaster reduction agency says that it is difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of the dead continues to increase due to the many bodies still trapped under the wreckage and we have yet to reach many people," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the agency.
The waves up to six metres had devastated Palu, where the mass funerals would be held on Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft provide aid supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute that passes, an ambulance carries the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to support the survivors but we don't know what's going on there.
This is a tragedy, but the situation can get worse."
Indonesia President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and stated in front of the National Army: "I wish all of you would work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN delivered.
Earlier this year Indonesia was attacked by earthquakes in Lombok, including over 550 dead.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini says there's a man missing after the crash that crashed at the coastal
Flight mining crashed at the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia saying that there was now a man missing, after the earlier statement that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that, until Saturday afternoon, we were unable to find a male passenger.
The airline reportedly worked with local agencies, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for further information about passengers, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven were taken to the hospital.
The airlines say six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all still in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact event series has not yet been specified.
Air and U.S. Navy both said the plane landed at the coast immediately after leaving the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had been short of runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said aircraft at very low altitudes.
"This is a good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others could wade through deep waters to the waist to reach emergency exit doors on a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants had panicked and shouted, and he suffered minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were working nearby while repairing the harbour also helped rescue by using floats to pick up those on shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows 111 people who died in the airline crash registered in the Chandra Network for the last two decades but no cases involving Air Niugini.
Analysis says the time of the night the girl was burned alive
The prosecution based on Saturday's records during the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
American Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He demonstrated to the jury how to use the mobile log to synthesize the movements of the defendant Quinton Tellis, aged 21 and victim Jessica Chambers, 19 the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from a cell phone number showing that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of her death, in conflict with his previous statement, the Clarisse Ledger delivered.
Data shows that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers' phone in the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday and testified that he was not present in the town that day.
When the prosecutor asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another conflicting detail is Tellis saying that he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile phone records indicate they've known each other for only about a week.
Rowlett said that from time to time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and communications from Chambers' phone.
"He erased you from his life," Hale said.
The defense lawyer expected to start closed debates on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the jury's trial on that day.

Another black man?!
NY's sister sued the couple who fired you after the "racial" message.
A nanny in New York Nanny sued a couple who fired her due to discrimination after she received a mistaken message from her mother complaining that she was "a black person."
The couple rejected them as racists, considering the lawsuit as a "money case".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed depression when she discovered the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who was black on the first day she came to take the job in 2016.
"No! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the confusion, Miss Plasco-Flaxman "hard" fired Miss Maurice, she said that the African-born nanny was about to quit doing a bad job and that she hoped there was a Filipino nanny, according to New York Post.
Miss Maurice is paid by day and goes home on her own.
Now, Miss Maurice is suing the couple to claim payment for dismissal behavior with a $350 compensation a day during the six-month period for the job she was hired to receive money despite the fact that they did not sign any contract.
"I want to show them, look, she can't do things like that," she said to the Post on Friday, she added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple had opposed the allegations that they were racists, saying that it was logical to end Maurice's work for fear that they could not trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife sent her a message she wasn't going to send.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," the husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But can you give your child to someone you've offended, even by mistake?
What about the new baby?
Tell me."
When compared to a case with a "money case", Plasco said that his wife had been giving birth for two months and was in "a very difficult situation."
"How would you deal with someone like that?
This is not a good thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the legal case was underway, the public's flow of opinion quickly pointed its nose at the couple on social media, derogatory of their behavior and the logic of the story.
Paddington Publishing House is afraid that readers will not be interested in the story of a talking bear, the letter says
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, she was born just after the book was widely accepted by readers, the letter revealed: "It's hard to put herself in someone else's place when reading the book for the first time was published.
It's wonderful now that we know about Paddington's great success."
When it comes to his father, a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a book for children from a small toy bear, he still feels optimistic when his work is rejected, she has shared more in the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which is a "fundedness" after his death last year.
When speaking of Paddington, she described as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was always quietly proud of his success.
"He's a pretty quiet man, and he's not an explosive person," she said.
"But since Paddington really existed with him, it's almost like you have a child and it has won certain success: you're proud of them even if they don't actually exist.
I think you saw Paddington's execution that way.
Although it was the product of his creative and fictional position, he always won a certain position for Paddington."
My daughter passed away and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
As soon as she landed her daughter was rushed to Louis Duque 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her but in vain.
"I call Nad regularly to say this is bad and she shouldn't have to," said Edan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that she would stop breathing for two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I'll always be there for you.
The doctors have pumped her heart medication and slowly pulled the pipe out of her body.
She stopped breathing several times and this is the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was not yet closed.
I can't cry or cry or cry because I'm with my family and everyone else.
I must be the one who binds them."
In the end, Miss Edann-Laperouse, who is now still grieving because of her daughter's departure, got on a plane with other passengers- face the challenge she would have to pass.
"No one knows," she said.
"I bow and cry all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the flight I felt sorry for Nad.
He needs my love and my understanding.
I know how much she loves her."
The grieving woman posted the postcard to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost their suicide relatives are trying to stop others from stealing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler at the time suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to be in the feeling that I have to go through every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45, lives in Lydney, stating that her son is a promising chef with laughter that is filled with trepidation.
"Everyone knows it because of that laugh.
They used to say the boy's laughter lit every room."
However, he left his job before he committed suicide because he found himself "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's younger brother, who at the time was 11 years old, also left like his brother after ending his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I constantly worry that there will be a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are always people you can meet, talk or even make friends.
Don't live in silence - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davies's for many years, lost Mark, her mate 15 years ago, shortly after the death of his mother.
"He's not talking about feelings of boredom or disappointment or anything like that," she said.
"Just a few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed his attitude.
He was in a bad mood on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents and he didn't give a damn about them or anything around."
She said that her husband's death was a huge loss to them, but they still had to try to get over it: "This caused a huge hole in our family.
It broke our hearts.
But we all went on to live and fight it."

Brett Kavanaugh's future was suspended as the FBI began investigating
Mr. Flake stated on Saturday that "I think, if we can actually get something like what he asked for—a limited investigation of time, limits on range we can collect a little bit," he added that he was afraid that the committees would be "inducted into" the bipartisan cases.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their procrastination is only a matter of time.
The mid-week elections, on November 6, - if it is expected, the Republicans who are now in very bad conditions will be even weaker in their attempts to find the representative they want to vote for the highest.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying in favor of Mr. Kavanaugh, who had been White House Assistant under President Bush, since which was accessible to his wife Ashley, who had been President Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI released the reports?
There will be a vote at the Senate, where there will be 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh may receive at least 50 Senate votes, which allows Mike Pence, currently vice president, to remove the knot and confirm the candidate position in the Supreme Court.
The number of Korean fugitives was strong under Mr. Kim's time.
The number of fugitive Koreans has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a legislature in South Korea said.
Park Byeong-seng, quoted data from the South Korean Unity Department, said that last year there were 1,177 escapes - compared to 2,706 escapes in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of the border control between North Korea and China and the large percentage of traffickers arrested was the main elements of this change.
The Ahmad has not made public comments.
Most of the fugitives from North Korea were eventually granted Korean citizenship.
Seoul stated that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed unauthorized borders since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the fugitives fled to China, were the country that shared the longest border with North Korea and they were able to easily cross the non-military zone (MDZ) heavily protected between the two countries.
China sees fugitives as illegal immigrants and not refugees and often force them to return to their homeland.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea - technically still in war conditions - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had met in Ping Ahmad to have negotiations that focused on non-humanization issues.
These movements took place after the historic encounter in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, both sides agreed with the extended terms to advance to the non-government of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho blamed the US sanctions for delay in the process.
"If there were no trust in the US there would also be no confidence in our national security issue and in such a case, there was no other way that we would find our own disarmament," said Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "the over-extradited element," and said that he was not fit for a position at the Supreme Court
The minority leader Nancy Pelosi has called the nomination for the position at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh as "the overexcited" and said that he is temporarily unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview that took place on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but I think that if a woman had done so, then they would call it 'the over-extradited", Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh insisted on refusing the allegations that he had assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both minors.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh expressed a great deal of emotion, there were times when he almost cried out and was foamed when talking about his family and five months in high school.
He also strongly denounced the Democratic Party before the committee, calling the charges against him as a "skilled act well planned" act due to anger that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was not fit for position at the Supreme Court, as he made it clear his conduct against the Democratic Party.
"I thought he had eliminated his character when he made his claims and his treatment when talking about Clinton's family and the Democratic Party," she said.
Pelosi refused when asked if she tried to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democratic Party won the majority in the House.
"I'll say this- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only not with the position at the Supreme Court but he's also having to present himself in court," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added, as a Democrat, she was interested in Kavanaugh's ability to make a ruling against the Department of Health Care Act of Money or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for an overexcited, biased man to take his place in court and hopefully we'll say, 'This isn't great,' Pelosi said.
Women need to make the most of it.
This was indeed a heavy criticism, month after month, year after year the anger grew greater, and she could not overcome without tears and tears.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think that's unusual, and you?"
She went on, "I've been a very supportive woman, she's the senior manager, she said she was also crying when she was angry but to form a reaction when she gets angry and starts crying, she'll tell the person she just talked to that said, "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And she kept crying.
And I think this is great."
You are allowed to cry to this behavior as part of an escape route for the rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my deepest memories of working at the first company was that it was a place only for men, I used to cry when there was rage, which was when I was struck by an elderly woman - the cold manager who always scared me - who pulled me into the staircase.
She told me "Never let them see her crying,".
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and happy that they're with you."
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply disappointed, claiming that there was no reason why she could not stand up for the presidential election herself.
30 years later she laughed and told me that "It wasn't a wise decision".
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and they needed another candidate.
Someone called this race "The Snow White and the Seven Sons".
Due to her late participation in the campaign, she was lost in the fund campaign, so she swore that she would not run for the election unless she raised $2 million.
The war failed.
She found that some supporters had given her $250 instead of $1,000 to support male candidates.
She wondered, "Do they think I'm getting a discount?".
When she declared that she would not launch an official campaign, she overcame her feelings - expressing gratitude to those who had supported her, disappointed with the system that made it difficult for the fundraising process and aimed at voters rather than delegates, she was angry at being sexist—that she was so angry that she choked.
"You may think I've had a nervous breakdown," said Miss Schroeder recalled the way the press reacted to her.
"You've been thinking of Kuratov as my company's sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna put on my headstone?
"Are you crying?"
The Central American Trade War could be a good signal for Beijing
Experts say the opening wing rescues for the trade war between the U.S. and China have been halted, and the war will continue, the break between countries can be an advantage for Beijing.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave the first warning by taxing China's major exports surfaces including solar panels, steel and aluminum panels.
The escalation has increased in recent weeks with a tax rate of £200 billion (150 billion) hitting half of China's goods imported into the US.
Beijing retaliated by increasing taxes between five and ten percent to 60 billion U.S. goods.
China is committed to retaliating corresponding to the actions of the US and the second largest economy the world can hardly be shaken early.
Getting Washington to give in meant that Beijing had to make demands, but publicly giving up before the U.S. was too embarrassing for the short-lived Mr. Shorter Ping, China's chairman.
However, experts suggest that if Beijing can deliver the right flags, in the long run the pressure of the trade war with the US can be a positive signal for China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact is that a political decision in Washington or in Beijing can all start an economic relationship in one of two countries and this is actually much more dangerous than what was previously admitted," said Abigail Grace, a research expert focused on Asia at the New American Security Center, making comments.
