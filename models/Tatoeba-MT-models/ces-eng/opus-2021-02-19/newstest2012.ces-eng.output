Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal a section within the framework of the amendment to the Penal Code on the basis of which the opposition leader Julius Tymoshenko was convicted.
At the second reading of the motion to mitigate the penalties for economic offences, Members rejected the adjustment that would open the way to the liberation of the imprisoned rapporteur.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in October for the conclusion of an allegedly disadvantageous contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final, the defendant's appeal is to be discussed by the court in December.
Tymoshenko calls the verdict a political vendetta of the regime, the suspicion of biasing the court also triggered a trial in the West.
Section 365, on the basis of which the Examiner was convicted, supported the proposal to fall out of the criminal code, supported 147 Members in the vote.
It took 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, which has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
There's a winner left to define.
As is customary in the region, Islamists will win the elections, but it is about moderation or radicality.
The Transitional National Council has signed up for sharia law, and we already have an idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as theft is a hand cut.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from the faith, and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There'll be order in Libya that we can't imagine and that we certainly wouldn't want.
But our way of life is not the only one, nor objectively the best one, and it probably would not suit the Libyans just mentioned for a change.
In fact, it's a wonder that Islamic warriors took gratitude from unbelieving dogs.
They are only excused that from their point of view, NATO raids were not directed by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated in every successful intervention.
So when winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We took part in a shootout, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the dictator's person without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
That leaves the locals with the problem of expelling the Crusaders.
But without the occupation of an oil company, will they have Libyan black gold for a kiss?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the selfless protection of human rights.
As long as it doesn't spoil the Sharia law enforcement.
A new era of crisis is about to begin.
France and the rest of Europe are on the lookout for investors
The statistical storm crossed Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have published GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated interquartally, Germany and France are growing.
But today, the bond market is breaking records.
Investors are no longer looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary estimates of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP increased by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was better expected next to it (up 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), but France stated that it appeared in a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year on year in this third quarter.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated on a quarterly basis and confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic performance, according to the CZSO.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year on year in this third quarter, but stagnated intermittently.
In the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally translated data, the German economy increased by 0.5 percent.
The euro area economy and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent year on year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish bonds are growing to critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields on Czech 10-year bonds are below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
From Germany, voices are that the ECB should be the lender of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate the 200 million advance
The football team has done the hardest job of the season!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful goal Petr Jiráček won 1:0.
Czech football, even with a big portion of luck in the second half, saved a luxury lead from home retaliation and will not be missed again in the European championship.
IHNED.cz watched the follow-up game in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
Czech representation also thanks to the domestic loss at the end, the great Czech and hero Jiráček won in Montenegro happily 1:0 and celebrates the advance to the European Championship.
Because of the precise defence of the Czech whole, the blackhorns were not pressured until the second half.
The losers of the match became Damjanovich and Vukinič, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech team will not miss the European Championships next year, and the prize will be about CZK 200 million.
There's been a lot of fighting football since the opening minutes.
Both teams were hard to join in the combination and played mostly around the half line.
The pressure of domestic footballers even in the first half did not come, because long kicks for defense were precisely averted by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've created a living shield.
Several hundred college students created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
In their gestures, they want to express support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the building at noon on Tuesday and then cried out the death of the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, created a living shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre, where uranium is being processed on Tuesday.
They show that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that Iran did not seem to have stopped pursuing a nuclear weapon.
There is talk of a possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities in Israel.
At noon, students prayed before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then cried out the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack to cripple Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, apart from the Isfahan Centre, the target would also be the Natanz facility in which uranium is enriched.
Obese baby's menu: doesn't eat sausages and dinners
More than a third of children 9 to 13 years of age have overweight problems, with 9 percent of schoolchildren overweight and 5 percent of children obese.
Obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey showed.
Once again, it shows how important it is for a healthy development of a person’s environment in which he grows up and the patterns that surround him.
For example, sausages appear half as often on the tables of obese children as in normal - weight families.
Fried fries had for dinner the day before the research related to an educational event called Obesity is not a coincidence of more than 19 percent obese.
In fat families, it is also not customary to play sports, but this applies to most of the families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children replied that their parents will find time to move actively at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year's school year and was attended by nearly 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of Obesity is not a coincidence supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from the 4th to 8th grade have been involved in the project.
The correct diet and exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
"Only half of the respondents said, for example, that they eat five times a day in breakfast-dinner-dinner-dinner-dinner mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites of proper nutrition," one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and no sausage at night
Experts point out that even relative details, such as regular family breakfast times, are essential to healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren’s families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing was finding out that in a tenth of the households, you don't eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
A questionnaire showed that the families of obese children consume unhealthy fries more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly, their parents had less than half - 15 percent.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own menus according to their own tastes and opinions.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of floury, meaty and sweet dishes.
"The popularity of sweet lemonade is particularly alarming," says the final survey report.
At lunch as the main dish, pasta won just above the poultry.
However, the children practically did not want legumes at all and the popularity of fish and lunch vegetables is low.
Adaptation to Health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In many cases, there was a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," says the project's results.
For example, it was marked with sweet lemonade, where more children would have preferred ordinary water.
Children have also checked poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire much more often and would limit sweet meals and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, asserting pros
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I complained a little bit that there was already a lot at the opening hours.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures of three pros in the field, clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how it works on set.
And it gets worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "streaked."
This time Alice and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And that's the vast majority.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy figure with no proper curves, and someone's overweight again.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, extend neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We got tips like Jennifer Lopez's type of woman, i.e. bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, nicely emphasize the figure and at the same time do not dress the woman too challengingly.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers really do not fit, then it is worth having at least one such piece made to measure.
You won't regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt, you will feel much better than in one that constantly shifts, draws up, stops at your waist and so on.
Once again, a boy’s character can afford to wear clothes with lashes, applications, embroidery, or pick-up.
Of course, there are many such information and types of characters, so I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still worried that given the homework assignment, it's a lot.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to invent two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the person and type of character.
I'll be "dressing" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
In my spirit of exultation, for me personally certainly better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about 100 kilos (please consider exaggeration), or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the clothes out of magazines or search them on the Internet and print them and then graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the whole result is said, will also express our personal style and relationship to graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic aspect of styling is important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific assignments, such as trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But that's not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture was filled with information about the character types, and three guests from the field became more diverse.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a handy stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is crucial in this case.
So for example such a short (or if you want to start with a trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a shirt like a cape, but you can also dress it on a bare body, put on boats and take pictures like a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules to work perfectly."
"Then you can start breaking them," said Jakub.
So I finally see why we're crushing ourselves with all these lessons, what to combine with, why, when we see something different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have a lot more clothes prepared than he can take pictures of.
So for a fashion story that has ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be prepared to hide at least 15.
And also that the picture of the clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
So that's what we have to count on when we make an outfit.
Honza Pokorný confirmed that the image and style does up to half of the success.
All you have to do is look at Madonna, who's not exactly a prodigy singer, but image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to the services of stylists is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look is secondary).
And if someone is already getting styling from us, then we have to expect that they will probably dictate to us a completely different (smaller) size than they actually have.
Then all we have to do is google and see if the tabloids were writing about the fact that the celebrity had grown fat and lost weight and so on.
On Sunday both Honza and Mario gave us the heart that a stylist is not enough to navigate in fashion and to be able to put together an outfit.
In his work he mainly communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to guess people, not pushy, stand up for your opinion.
"If you're ordered by a manager to sort out her wardrobe and fill her up with nice pieces, you can't just throw her out of the closet and say, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things to praise and recommend what they can be worn for," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called "bullet", or bag on the set, must contain.
It's the one you put around your waist and you've got all the propriets you need.
In addition to clear things, such as scissors, hair rollers or safety pins, there are also silon threads (with which the stylist helps in photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips, by which we fasten the clothing in the back, if it is larger (the pin or other clamp is not permissible, they would destroy the clothing), or a sewing machine.
So that we wouldn't just listen, but we also practically tried something out, we learned how to bend our shoes properly.
Even when photographed in an studio with a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch the shoes with scissors so they don't accidentally get damaged.
So it takes real skill.
Mario pleased me when he commended my creation without reservation.
The skill mentioned is really not my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard on the second weekend course.
I'm getting more and more clear that it's not really a walk in the park, no matter what anyone says.
In Need for Speed: The Run is raced across America.
Review
Originally, a carefree ride is transformed into a routine morning shift trip due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes.
Ambition was largely accomplished, but it is of no use when no one seemed to want to do anything extra.
The new episode with the subtitle The Run raised high expectations before the release.
He promised that the old race series Need for Speed would once again move a bit in a new direction and from playable demonstrations appeared to be a game that would not be in the genre of action racing just to number.
We were also curious to see how the embedded passages would end up in which the main hero would get out of the car and run on his own.
However, as is the case with the NFS series, many results are a little different than we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down a few unnecessary mistakes that have been appearing in the series for more or less years.
So it's not really mistakes, it's more of a kind of incomprehensible laziness of developers.
Adventure begins very well.
You are introduced into a story whose main hero Jack has certain personal issues and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You'll get behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco, and your job is to be the first to arrive in New York.
The idea brings with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't get the feeling that the game is always the same.
Some of the environments are also very pretty to look at, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing world-class.
But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in snowy mountains seems visually very pleasant.
Moreover, from time to time, races are varied by an uncharacteristic element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you must be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
In addition, individual races are quite well placed in a row.
There's only a few types, but it's enough.
For a while you are trying to overtake the desired number of opponents (actually classic race), then you are catching up again (classical fight with stopwatches) and then there is a duel waiting for you with only one opponent.
Police will also get involved in this from time to time, which makes your efforts even more difficult.
New is the passages outside the car.
It's more of an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by printing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But they will be surprised that these passages are in play much less than you would expect (in particular perhaps only three).
But in the end it is for the benefit of the thing, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying and in the context of the above mentioned, it ranks among the elements that augment the game.
The ride model follows in the footsteps of previous parts.
This means that it is certainly no longer anything these days, but it cannot be said that it is a negative.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the more active racing of the local driving model still suits quite well, even though we could find better in the competition.
So far, everything's in perfect order.
However, problems begin to emerge after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is no longer in order.
We don't expect this type of game to count complex deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how your car will behave before any impact on any object, then I guess everything's not all right.
Typically, when you drive over or pass cars in normal traffic, you sometimes lick each other easily, but sometimes in an almost identical situation, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even go straight for it.
The reboot system doesn't seem to bother you at all, but it will make you feel better.
The reboots are designed so that if you smash or drive far off the track, the game will throw you back at the last clue point on the track.
But there are only five reboots available in each race.
When you run them out, you have to start the race all over again.
So it's more of a tool in case something goes wrong than if you could rely on it.
Sometimes reboots don't help, however, it solves the need to learn a given section of the race by heart.
The big problem with the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply can't fit in.
Other times, you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later.
It will piss you off especially in situations where you can see the opponent passing easily between two opposing cars in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to go around or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you get there, because it's "counted" so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
Throughout the game, you will find several places where you, again regardless of the time, always overtake the same opponent in the same place.
It hits the most at the end of the game on the long bridge, where you drive in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get there in front of you at any cost, apparently.
When it's ahead of you, it's getting worse for you to look at the cars, so at first, you're probably going to have a couple of smashes.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenalineier, but the performance is so obvious that it reliably quickly disgusts you.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and sometimes so actionful that sometimes you can't quite watch where things fly.
And it doesn't really matter whether the concept of 50 unique tracks, the gearing of the races, is responsible so that boredom doesn't stand a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to switch cars during the race.
You have to watch out for gas stations near the roads, because that's where you can change the car, although in most cases you can get by with what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sport cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars on straight highways and exotic supercars for technical riding, for example on winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand and mode of challenges, which are races in individual locations, which you know from the story.
Here you receive not only medals, but also experience points into your profile, which is common for both challenges and story.
Various items are unlocked to gain a higher level of driver: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for profile.
It is also linked to the online Autolog function, which compares your achievements with other players and provides other community functions.
One other difficult to understand is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you can get to the subway tunnel (but so be), where you drive it in the dark on the tracks (but so be).
On the tachometer, the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (let's be) flash, and in that direction, the subway line comes crashing in and scrapes you uncompromisingly.
In the editorial office, we can probably still for a few days talk about whether nobody really gave a little thought when creating the game, or whether the authors think we're really that big of an idiot.
The technical aspect of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It is so saddened that, in some tenser moments, the imagery decreases, in some cases rather tragically.
However, it is mainly about accidents with more participants, when continuous imaging would not be of any use to you anyway.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible range of the younger audience, a soundtrack from the "every dog in a different village" category was created, but it is possible to assume that someone will not just buy the game for listening to music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so greatly embarrassed.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work of the NFS in the last few years.
But this is how the game looks unfinished.
I'm sure it's fun, but get ready for mistakes to blow your eyes out with the power of airport spotlights.
The singing choirs of the UK will be heard at a concert by students of velvet

Ambassador to the EU Viceno:
Czechs have a reputation for negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has seriously disrupted the balance between institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five or six years for the situation to settle down a bit, and for all players to get used to their new roles," began her lecture at the Faculty of Law by the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, Milena Vicenová.
As much as she takes her motto "Smartly and openly about Europe" seriously, she showed in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that she could be envied by a number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"First, there was a criticism that he was bland, that he was a gray official, that he couldn't perform any role, and I must say that everyone was blown away, that he performed the role well."
"He is a man who can listen to and communicate with 27 Member States and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained in response to the question: 'Who is this European Union? To which telephone number should I call?', i.e. an important step towards unification and greater readability of Union policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to stop us from saying shit.
Vicen has also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lived and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency described it as a success last year.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time then marked the Czech Republic as a major negative, which has seriously damaged the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, 'a fact of difficulty' was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being addressed today.
Moreover, a new seven-year budget of the Union still needs to be approved, which is precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and economical, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which less, is all on the agenda for future negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: 'A Europe of clarity'.
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, lingo that nobody understands.
How is a citizen supposed to understand that there are really no curved or round cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of different sizes or that someone really has to forbid us from gypsums."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
We've got a multi-speed Europe waiting for us.
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than positive aspects of the matter.
Moreover, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, many factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, if a Pole and a Hungarian comes to me and the Slovak comes to me, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what's that Visegrad Four of yours?" and doesn't look happy about it."
In the future, the Union, according to Viceno, is mainly faced with new hard rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
It perceives the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe as very real rather than a new 'European Federation'.
"We have euro area countries and countries outside the euro area."
"We have the Schengen area, we have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
For the first time, it was said that only the countries that they wanted and those that they didn't want should cooperate.
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the whole Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
The IBM Innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were looking for a word that would best express IBM's strategy, the closest would probably be "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation of this longevity was laid by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already stamped a password that many of the world’s problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became a print around which the life of the future giant (and also the name of the internal magazine, which began to be published in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business, and society during our first centuries.
We hope that we can achieve even more in the second hundred," said Samuel J. Palmisano, current director on the anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson treated his employees in the 1930s, like the entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - people from IBM had paid holidays as one of the first American employees, employer insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and traders.
The IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
The company was brilliant at extracting talent from the beginning - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that a woman - Virginia Rometty - will replace Palmisana in charge of IBM next year.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years and has been the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called yams, online brainstorming, which have resulted in many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there's enough ideas - almost half a million people work at the firm.
Institutions with a good name
Its strong internal and external image ensures a firm position in the business.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems for the use of technology," said George Colony from Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it is famously nicknamed because of its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents from all American technology companies and five of its employees won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a floppy disk.
IBM with roughly $220 billion this year became the second largest technology company according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first outstriped Microsoft since 1996.
Forward View
Not all products and innovations hit customers' tastes and times - IBM failed to place a bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online Prodigy services or IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you cannot emotionally cling to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and when they don't work, leave them.
Unlike, for example, the competing Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM's sales account is mostly about services, and after about a fifth they are made by software and hardware.
In 1990 he was the most powerful hardware representative with more than half a share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies during the same period.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the world’s current financial crisis swept over for the first time.
IBM is acting on the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM appears to be going through the current crisis intact.
The price of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, while the net profit of the company continues to increase.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything but its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant can handle it.
History of IBM: From Cheese Slicing to Flying to Space
IBM (International Business Machines) was established in New York a hundred years ago, originally with a complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was taken over only in 1924 - originally it was a brand used for branches of the company in Canada and South America.
The merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the nineties, gave the basis for later IBM.
They owned technologies such as famous "punches," which means clocks recording employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over the supervisory board of the company until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of a rival firm, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas still have an unbeatable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began to produce and sell all kinds of machines for business - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four years that Watson was in charge of the company, the turnover doubled to $9 million and the company's extensive expansion began in all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after almost 40 years in the boss's chair, his son, Thomas Watson Junior, replaced him.
Under his leadership IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly into space - Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "basket" that established the computer standard of the time, called IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of Lenovo's computers, on the contrary, bought a consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to fully engage in high value-added consulting and services.
The strategy that has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, a "smarter planet".
Its aim is to use technology smartly in unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or urban administration.
IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform for the business area, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia back then in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, besides the IBM CR, the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno also operates here.
Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
Quicklist about an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, you can keep that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also the lover, Darin hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now he's not going to wait, and he's set clear rules for another life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová granted asylum to Bartošová in her home in the summer, she probably didn't dream how her marriage would end.
Even though Iveta moved from Říčana after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
As time passed, Darina resigned from her husband’s relationship, and now she even gave him good-bye forever.
The Redguard doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If the Knight and Bartosh had broken up once after all, his wife’s arms would not be open at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our house, no one will cast him out."
"But she will live to see him not as my beloved, straying old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," said Rychtářová, saying that she has already detached herself from her husband and insists only on each other's decency.
Joseph doesn't mind Darina closing the back door for now.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, and I'm not going to change it."
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I do repairs, garden, real estate, shopping."
"Darina and I are having a normal conversation, except we don't share a bed together," said Rychtář.
She said if she had found a new love, she wouldn't have stopped her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and I take full responsibility," said Josef.
Worst female habits: Do they concern you?
When you ask the men if they could name any typical female vices, they're usually all very quick to pour them out of their sleeves.
Dear women, will you get to know each other in the following lines, where there are several female vices that can perfectly pump the blood in men's veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to shop in bulk at discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women realize that they should temper their shopper’s passion at least a little.
But tell me, which one could resist walking around the clothing stores, looking for a good suit and then try them all (ideally in different colors) in the dressing room?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a living hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you at the front door...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start practicing?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't it?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners complain about their appearance all the time.
The stronger the sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying the women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless merry-go-round.
Window washing, vacuuming, paving, dust cleaning, bath scrubbing - at least twice a week.
Are you blaming your partner for stepping on a clean paving floor, for soiling the scrubbed sink and putting on a glazed living wall that you've done so much work polishing with?
In case you are suffering from this "inversion", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not be placed first within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanness can endanger your relationship with one another and your family well - being.
Bumping
"Throw those used shorts in the trash."
"You're gonna wear those old socks tomorrow too?"
"A wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you poke your partner this way several times a day, know that you can really dial him.
Of course you don't mean any harm, you want to make everything okay.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn't have to dig into them so much...
Blasphemy, gossiping
For some women, gossip, gossip, and insults are also their own, and conspiracy against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
Perhaps each of us will let loose some harmless little gossip or gossip.
Hand to heart, it's all women's own.
The opposite are the gossips of the rudest grain, which they like and often gossip, perhaps despise everyone and are particularly dangerous to their surroundings - especially within the framework of the female labour collective -.
Jagr and Voráček helped to win Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromír Jagr participated in a Monday’s NHL game with two assists in winning Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina ice and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was declared the best player of the game, benefited from the 35-year-old star in both cases.
Two assists in the match were recorded by Jágro's teammate Jakub Voráček.
After the match, the Jagr told overseas journalists that he had predicted a big night for Giroux.
"I told him before the game he'd put on a hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get such a feeling," explained Jagr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the first Flyers shot.
A while later, the team had a second hit with a Czech footprint.
Voráček won a disc behind Hurricanes goal and presented it between the rings scoring Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first break decreased in weakening the home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically to Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagr scored a third goal, then his shot melted through the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," appreciated Jagr's center.
"I never thought I'd be playing hockey with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to play him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning," said Jagr.
Carolina still made the game a drama, with Tuoma Ruutua's goal, and again Dwyer, who made his way out of the penalty shootout, got the difference of one goal.
However, Matt Read did not allow further complications, which ended the double-to-one renumbering.
"Excellently intervened in our band Pronger."
"He cut out the disc, I picked up the speed, and (Read) drove to a further pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked," Voráček described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia was the leader of the Eastern Conference with the victory.
Czech defenseman Jaroslav Špaček did not finish the game against Buffalo, in the second period he resigned due to injuries in the upper body.
The Candiens, alongside the experienced bek, lost the two-goal lead and lost after penalty shot 2:3.
One of their raids did not turn Tomas Plekanec.
The home coach, rather than losing points, was saddened by a large sickle of the rear row, while the game was only finished by five defenders.
"It's bad."
"We only finished the match with one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's just nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The rotation was coming at us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, pushed the puck out of our zone."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defensemen P.K. Subban.
Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty hits to Winnipeg winning 5:2 over Tampa Bay.
Five different shooters shared the Jets goals, who interrupted the five-game losing streak.
How the price of tours developed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
At that time, travel agencies in the vast majority sold only trips to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists thus travelled for a holiday to the sea in the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Society in Crimea near the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both towards the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime inclined towards the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually even within socialist countries.
If the citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union for example, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise the individual way was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered tours to the West at the time, but it was necessary to stand in line overnight with sleeping bag or to have "good friends" in the travel agency.
Still, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for the trip to the West.
By far, however, the Czechs most often spent their holidays in the Czech Republic, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs acquired and this custom survives to this day.
Traveling by Czechs has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While the holiday in GDR or Bulgaria was our maximum until 1989, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations abroad in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is that it was not possible for us to travel to the most popular Croatia since it was part of Yugoslavia until 1989.
Right from the early 1990’s, visa requirements were lifted to neighbouring Western European countries, which triggered a huge wave of short-term visits mainly to Austria’s Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there for a while.
In Paris, for example, Czech trips slept in tent parks, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czech travel at this time was the carriage of own food, cans, salamis, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely exchangeable Czech crown, which allowed our tourists to finally purchase the Western currency after many tens of years.
However, our standard of living and, with it, our average salaries were rising, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have regularly started to prepare charter flights since 1997, making air tours incredibly cheaper because of the possibility to negotiate quantity discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs had visa-free contact with virtually all developed countries of the world, except the US, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when thanks to considerable demand he was sent from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to exotics, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters fly with Czech tourists to warm distant countries, this winter will be flown directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US cancelled visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in history (50.3%) and spent more than 15 thousand CZK per person for one foreign holiday, including the cost of their stay.
The General Assembly is supposed to find the chairman, but again there's a chance
Almost five months is Czech football without the chairman, and the successor to Ivan Hašek, headed by the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), threatens not to be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on what electoral order will be followed.
Without it, there will be no voting on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and, as he left, invited his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the era after Hasek, football slipped back to the skirmishes between the two union chambers that couldn't agree on a common candidate.
This became clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the general meeting came to the National House in Prague in Smíchov for nothing, because the meeting was blocked and it was not just a method of choice.
There was no consensus on who actually has the right to vote at the meeting - whether only the statutory representatives or even the functionaries of the mandate of full authority.
There has been a partial agreement on this single point since then, which was also supported by the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the law, according to which representation under authority is not possible.
But there are still disputes about the electoral order.
Neither did the executive committee, which no longer addresses anything else in its negotiations, whether proper or extraordinary.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how do we proceed in the third round to rule out the possibility of heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the Statutes or find another model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FACR Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the Association.
According to the statutes of the proposed third-round model, one of the candidates who will have greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is said to be willing to go for a concession to win a candidate who will gain a higher sum of the percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side enforces the condition that the winner must gain at least two thirds of the advantage at this percentage.
"But that would make sense of the two previous rounds, which would completely deny the two-chamber concept," the Moravian party Svoboda understands, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and choose according to valid statutes.
Tomáš Paclík is somewhat surprisingly in agreement with this, although it is estimated that the electoral order is best suited to Pelt of all candidates by the statutes designated by the electoral order.
"I wish that the vote should be made according to the statute."
"In order not to invent any intercessive nonsense like at the last general meeting," said the owner Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his observations he defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he believes that the new President will be known and believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All passions will calm the possible progress of today's national team at the European Championships."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, more willingness to cooperate," says the Jablonec official, who has the greatest experience in managing football at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided."
"It is not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations in an intended way."
"This can cause the general meeting to be blocked again."
"I hope, however, that common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There's not much time left for all parties to agree on.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality would be complete by the game.
The air special, in which the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorice, including the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, did not leave Prague due to technical failure in the morning and were looking for a replacement option to transport part of the executive committee to the scene of the barrage retaliation.
Finally, the ministerial meeting, which may allegedly take place on Wednesday, may be decisive.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to force the divided parties inside the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot to be done: state subsidies, credibility of football and also the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes to fight for the chairman because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If the football leader of Pilsen Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have met all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he would not have even signed up for the fight for the top position.
"If a good candidate exists, I'm fighting for him, and I'm not going to the election."
"But in the current situation, no such person was found," Paclík told the Czech News Agency.
Until the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclík is motivated to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favorite of the election, from going to the head of the FACR.
Paclík also emphasizes that, in the event of his victory, he would only last in the role of president until 2013, when a proper general meeting is on the agenda.
In his position, he would like to see an experienced and top manager, who is not very connected to football events.
"I've spoken to some people who would come to light."
"It was crazy for me when some people said they didn't even want to identify themselves with Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Paclík is said to be most concerned about Pelt's connection with the president of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the votes of delegates at the general meeting.
It's so unacceptable for Paclík to stand in the chair.
"If he had won, the current situation would have been preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"In combination with Berbra's support, who is a skilled businessman, football would not benefit even more," Paclík said.
It also points to the fact that Pelt’s name was heard years ago in reply during an investigation into the corruption affair, but from which Pelt came unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring."
"And how would we also look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who, however, is already taking his former statement into account that he would "sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta became chairman".
But if Paclík triumphed on Thursday's election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
The other candidate Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco, considers the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I would go to."
"He has great powers."
"I could think of him as the head of the team."
"But he couldn't manage the association with management."
"I don't stick my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who in September attracted great attention by standing behind the appeal of the judges' committee led by Luděk Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík says he'd dare to run the association.
He refers to his ability to manage private companies, and since last summer he has also been in charge of Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated the premier league triumph in May.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment to contribute to his particular culture."
"To limit the influences of some interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal committee, which treats disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not conceal his antipathy to, for example, Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to strengthen the relations of the FACR with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it would lobby political leaders to get more lottery tax money into the sport.
"It's one of the key things the new chairman should do."
"If gambling is taxed, as political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to say frankly where the money will go," he said.
As a burden, Paclík now does not even take his connection to the Pilsen club, even though he himself claims that the chairman of the FACR should be "superpartisan".
Pelta is once again connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to Dukla in Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"I don't see the point in hypocritically transferring my stock to someone at the Pilsen Club and going back there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised a new charter of FACR to rule out the electoral stalemate
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the event of election, he would take a stand so that the FACR would have new statutes, which would definitely rule out disputes over the electoral order in the future.
Before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, the Jablonec official is optimistic and believes that the electoral struggle will significantly dampen the possible success of today's football team.
Pelta had already promised before September's unrealized choice that he would concentrate on the representation and acquisition of finance in the event of election.
He decided to go to the last minute before the last general meeting, so he could use a two-month delay to defend his ideas about football management and present himself in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time, and they expect to know the chairman on Thursday."
"He feels it's high time for someone to run the association," says the man who is associated primarily with the Apple Club, but who has worked in Sparta and the executive committee of the Union for many years.
He therefore believes that he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems with the choice are behind the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they do not allow different interpretations, we have had a chairman since September," Pelt pointed out.
The revision of the most important document of the civic association took as a decoy to delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take this as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principle thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He says he's still trying not to define himself against his opponents.
He announced earlier that he could imagine working with Henry Rajchle, who he recognized for his legal education, and he knew well that his opponent would be his first vice president.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year, he's got some success."
"His attacks, however, were undignified, and a lot of people were caught off guard in the way of the election campaign."
"That is why many of them now doubt his true character," said Pelt, who is said to remain loyal to the proclamations he announced in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the representation.
That should be the football window window window.
"And I would also try to end all affairs, starting with the Bohemians case or the resounding of last year's corruption scandal."
"Then I would like to take a meeting with both the private and the state sectors to secure enough money for the entire football," told ČTK, a 46-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his coming to the head of football would mean no personal cleansing.
"I would first have to get acquainted with the content of individual employees," Strahov said, where there is an understandable nervousness from the long absence of control.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, they believe that on Thursday the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If the only issue is how it's going to be voted in the third round, then we can move on."
"Football needs credibility, and the only way it's going to get it is by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains optimistic two days before perhaps the decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that under him the FACR would start working hard
If the current Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl was elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Thursday General Meeting, many people in the Association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start working hard.
He wants to push through systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by previous President Ivan Hašek.
"As President, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to representations, professional football, performance football to youth."
"I'm not saying I'd do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview for the Czech News Agency.
"I'm a team player, and I want to distribute competence on the executive committee so that each member is engaged in a particular area."
"And I'm going to give out hard tasks so that football moves a mile forward in every segment."
"Many people would probably not be happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticise the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he was thinking about not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks at me and question my every move," he explained.
"Many people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also said to be motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Haske.
"There's been a lot of work done over the last two years, and I don't want to throw it away right now."
"There are started processes that will have a revitalization in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with concern that if another candidate was elected Miroslav Pelta, the situation on the Union could return to the time before Haskem.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelt can do."
"Behind him are mainly connected people who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not for being sidetracked."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl remarked.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech President.
"Although some people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the first league."
"This would not be the current situation with only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsen Club Tomáš Paclík has also joined the fight for the President, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its Vice-President and sees that there are clear achievements behind me," Rajchl said, who considers the savings of tens of millions of crowns on unfavorable contracts, negotiation of television contracts and negotiations on the lottery law as his achievements.
On the contrary, he feels that the union is not pulling together.
While he claims Pelt is "disqualified to return trust to Czech football", he considers the other of Paclík's rivals to be a strong candidate who has much to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he had been elected, he might have continued with the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to twist it in his favor," Rajchl says.
Europe’s Most Beautiful Pools
♪ Jump into blue ♪
Julia Stanek
A paddling pool from the point of view of the UFO, a luxurious swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a tour of the cities or travel let his tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book shows where the wellness is the most beautiful by the water.
When Iris Meder went on discovery trips for the past one and a half years, her luggage should not miss her bathing suit.
Lying on the water, she looked up to the heights of artistically shaped domes, swam across from the marble putti (a small naked boy, a child (with wings) who waited for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pool.
If she liked any of the swimming pool, she took it into her notebook in no time - even with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the historian of Meder architecture and are now presented in her recently published book "Badefreuden": People's swimming pools in Munich, the historical palace of swimming pools in Schwarzwald, "The Hard Core of Concrete Structures" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "Town to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited locations in Italy, France, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiasm for the Plovin culture.
With sports it's not too much, says Meder - only in the water it's something else.
To anger, fans of swimming must be content with the blue tiles and chlorine smell, while health runners can breathe in the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why swimming pools must always be so hideous," says living Mrs Meder in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Splashing in the ski jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the comfort factor is therefore so big that it concerns all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founding fathers tried, the swimming pools can be a real sight for the eyes: "Instead of the floor, a man has a water surface in the spa."
"It's both transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is optically doubled: high arches, colorful tiles, jumper boards.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis of wellnes - but it primarily encourages the desire to jump into blue.
A remarkable specimen was discovered by Mrs. Meder's swimming pool collector in her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, it found nitrate water in the original karst cave (a cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a wonderful spectacle. While you can see the whole city in the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton’s outdoor swimming pool, Arlberg – and: In the steam baths there is a window from which you can watch the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Aquapark looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
The steam rises from the three ups and downs in winter while the mountains of Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
In every swimming pool, Mrs. Meder's smell of chlorine rose to the nostrils.
Many thermal baths are scented with sulfur, in the Arpad Spa in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells of fuel oil to the point where one can hardly believe that one has reached the spa.
The smell comes from medicinal water containing alkaline hydrogen carbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as one slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic bath Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902 the architect Dušan Jurkovič designed the spa was closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the massive growth of weeds between the tiles.
On the other hand, they stood up in a magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already had three stages of construction; one can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements that come from the time of their inception in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995 Palais Thermal has been a popular spa place for pool expert Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because she comes from Schwarzwald.
"It is already a performance to combine such diverse construction styles into such a beautiful complex", says Mrs. Meder.
At a palace like this, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank is having the commodity trade checked.
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the group chief wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and the other credit institutions step out of this business because the problems of the poorest world are deepening.
This is the result of the Forsa survey under the responsibility of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on the report Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that the stakes at global commodity markets drive prices to a height, and the banks are therefore complicit in the world’s hunger problem.
Consumer protection campaigns are directed specifically at the head of Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, although large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley also act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk business have detached themselves from supply and demand - and have made profits on behalf of the poorest.
Otherwise, the US competitors responded to the criticism of Ackermann: He promised to examine the criticisms and said that no trade "is worth putting on the stakes of Deutsche Bank's reputation."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group controls the complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The check is to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to do so.
At the end of January, the bank’s representatives want to tell what the consequences will be.
At the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his own image.
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened his criticism of the financial sector: "Bet on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthlessly banks are today harming the general good."
Let Ackermann, as the highest bank lobbyist, do his duty.
"Deutsche Bank must cut all items from its portfolio for which money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
"It's a matter of whether Mr. Ackermann cares about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's insight seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group boss would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors would not be transferred to the Supervisory Board.
Averting the disputed agrarian speculation could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about the potential losses - that should be dealt with in the end by his successor.
Every other person would have reported investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Institute of Forsa interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is precisely 11 percent that Deutsche Bank considers it legitimate that it offers investments with which food prices are staked.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: each other would lose out on all investments in which money flows into speculation with raw materials as a result of the survey.
43 percent would warn the acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said that they would think about shutting down their account and going to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Removal pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy ending: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and desolation.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
When it seeks modern post-war architecture, clear forms, glass halls, bold expansions and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technological progress, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a fitting and famous example.
The Schwanzer pavilion was then received by the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and protracted construction of steel and glass.
The construction is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion of Austria during the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus as a key carried out by a side construction in Munich, 1973 finally became internationally famous.
Its temporary exhibition building was designed by the pavilion after the world exhibition in Schweizer Garten near the Vienna Südbahnhof (Southern Railway Station), renovated and opened in 1962 the Museum of the 20th century - it was named the "House of the 20th Century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art had a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and decaying more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz reconstructed the pavilion, now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Belvedere Gallery in Austria, was a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a distinguished art historian with a distinguished career, i.e. a figure skater in her youth, later in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museo Modern Salzburg, strongly promoted reconstruction with politicians and memorabiliars, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined use.
In addition to contemporary art, works by the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the same-named foundation, a café and bookshop should be established, and an office building had to be built to do so.
Strict surveillance, low budget.
Krischanitz was the ideal cast to perform.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna at Schwanzer and the pavilion was an "immoderately important place" for him, at which he "almost every weekend" looked at exhibitions.
He knew the original project and he also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and ease in its relocation to Vienna and its change of use.
During the current reconstruction, there were much bigger problems: the building was a "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
Glass facade window profiles were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass and glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
Cold bridges-steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been rescinded.
Two underground floors provided a place for a new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a towering Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door was preserved, the building is painted in an old anticorrosive red-brown colour tone.
And the cinema hall is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument office and the low budget.
"Often there had to be found material that was good and cheap and also liked the monument office", says Krischanitz and points to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was said that it was difficult with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
It is said that such architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "build up proper self-esteem".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, as an urban accident occurred: In the area around Schweizer Garten there is a completely newly designed "Městská čtvrť u Hlavní nádraží" with office and residential buildings.
And perhaps there is another happy coincidence: the house of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischanitz building, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already negotiating with the city a neighborhood at a station in Schweizer Garten.
The runway is planning a million-dollar package for the winter crisis
The runway set up a crisis plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter caused by train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn spends more than EUR 70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report, referring to the internal group plan, that it is said to be planned for 2015 in total with investments of around EUR 300 million.
It is said that better use of trains and rail networks should also be achieved under extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external staff to 16 000 people for snow removal on railway installations and platforms.
The aim is to get rid of the platform until the start of operation and 90 percent for operation of the necessary switches during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, the head of railways, warned of train outages and delays during this winter after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives.
In the last winter, the passenger transport route had considerable problems, because, among other things, under difficult weather conditions it lacked reserves.
Thus, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Authority for years.
In addition, delays in ICE train reporting
For years, the runway has also failed to cope with the fact that ICE trains must be repaired more often by the workshop when one of the ICE trains at Köln Central Station was destroyed.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the US
After a commotion about Chief Josef Ackermann, there are new trampos in the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million-dollar compensation there.
As if there were no problems at home, Deutsche Bank caught up with a giant in the field of his past in the US: Frankfurt is paying $145 million in a settlement procedure ($106 million) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage certificates.
The financial market regulator of NCUA blames a number of large banks for misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they have probably reduced the risks.
During the crisis, such papers lost a great deal of value and brought the banks to an abyss with them.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the subject without having to bring the parties to court", said Deutsche Bank's spokesperson in New York.
The bank admits no guilt by settling.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
The Chairman of the NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the accommodation of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the USA and is helping bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to get compensation for billions of damages.
Now completed settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator was also attached to other large banks and in summer he sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
For dubious mortgage sheets it is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the US housing bubble collapsed in 2007, it became fatal to a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Although events took place a few years ago, the banks are now being blown by a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to obtain redress or to be affected by misconduct.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) started the biggest wave of lawsuits.
He complains to 18 international large banks that two state-owned US real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have put about $200 billion in mortgages at a disadvantage.
Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA lawsuit, with more deals totaling about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses" without, however, giving an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requirements as unfounded and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters the IBM with $10 billion.
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT-business IBM.
Since March, he has purchased more than $10 billion worth of shares.
So far, major US investor Warren Buffett has always claimed that he will not invest in IT and computers, because long-term development of companies is only difficult to predict.
But now he read the IBM business reports and changed his mind about investment in the business.
Much earlier he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for IT-departure of other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered knighting in the financial world.
As a result, the motherland of IT IBM may now be called "Sir IBM".
For Buffett revealed at the US economic radio station CNBC that since March he had purchased $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett sagte that even IBM had no knowledge of his involvement.
He commended management, which, during the economic crisis, tried even for proper returns.
"You did a great job," said Buffett on strategy.
IBM has been betting on lucrative IT-services for a long time, such as the operation of computing centers.
More than 100-year-old computer pioneers also offer software and consulting as well as powerful computers for companies.
Buffett has been avoiding technological companies to this day.
They claim that they invest only in undertakings whose activities they also understand.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight rail, lubricant manufacturers or machine products.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns next to about 80 of its own subsidiaries also shares in a number of large-scale farms such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
In the 1960 ’ s, 81 - year - old master took over a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and built one of the most valuable businesses in the world with wise investments.
Yet, his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM’s shares rose by one percent before the stock exchange started.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market and is considered by Apple and Microsoft to be the world's most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, so many Buffetts, he wouldn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be a close friend of his.
The threat is tangible.
After the discovery of the "Bunks in Zwickau", the Turkish media question the German rule of law.
The paper even speaks of a "blood ideology" that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek from 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was responded to with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
Because for many German Turks, this brings back a scarecrow that has long been thought to be dead: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
There was never any doubt that there was xenophobia in Germany.
But the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals the extent of which dimension can no longer be seen.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" were the headlines of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators should have been a secret police agent for the Constitutional Protection Department and fear that the German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded wisely: It recalled this weekend's demonstration of silence before the Brandenburg Gate of victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, remembered the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Recruitment Agreement.
In cheerful colors, a life together was staged - as a history of success.
The news coverage of several Turkish media works as a field: "Gift to the 50ths of Germany" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murder series.
The issue of the newspaper "Hürriyet" for Germany will also not be taken away in order not to make this thought connection.
"It's starting to stink," sounds the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
It emphasises that people who paid taxes were murdered and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany by their work.
The most critically discussed in the German internet forums is the police procedure and its late success in the search.
Why did the German authorities not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
This is how many demonstrate at least rhetorically prompt to use drastic means: "If the activity continues to be carried out so superficially, the immigrants will be left with nothing but their own defence and armed".
"That's probably the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarification and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on internal peace in Germany," writes Selen.
What it means when internal peace is threatened in Germany is explained by the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
A photograph of the burn site in Solingen is deeply embedded in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat and the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
However, the assassinations have made the Turks more aware of the feeling of reciprocity.
Do not repeat past mistakes
In the Turkish press, the failure of German policy after the assassinations was criticized at that time: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a sympathies telegram to the Turkish state president, but he was allowed to represent his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the funeral ceremony in Köln when he calculated in his speech what fees the Turks had paid.
Quite as if the value of a man was measured by the height of his taxes.
The current news coverage of Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks is in the local state-right order.
In addition to efforts to make extensive clarifications and a new evaluation of right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
The Scandal Bank at Lake Zurich
Europe’s most adventurous bank is based not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered almost bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has been slipping from one crisis to another ever since.
Now some German's supposed to straighten it out.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank in July, it became known that 2013 would take almost the same spectacular new job: the President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber enjoyed publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidarity and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached a turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But it was clear in September that everything would turn out completely differently.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all the bank’s security systems and wasted around 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, a respected banker, had to leave.
The president of the UBS Board has since been as scalded as well - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And it will take over the chairmanship of the Management Board as early as May - not only in 2013, as the Bank communicated on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough on Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
He will then suddenly take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which just once proved that he deserves the title "Bank of the Greatest Scandals in Europe"
Because UBS is both huge - until recently the world's largest asset manager - and it has been sliding for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, will not be spared by the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed excellent reputations.
The image of a silent and solid but also a cunning asset manager combines with ambitious goals: It also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So she managed UBS 2007 on the one hand with $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it went to the league of the world's largest banks
That was impressive.
Former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger relates: "I always listed UBS as a model of a good bank to my students at the time."
"From today's point of view, how could I have been so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was first apparent that something had gone wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, head of the board, who was still considered a highly intelligent and brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, there was a sense of why he left.
The Bank’s investment division wasted Subprime-paper and had to write off billions.
In order to withstand this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
Indeed, she found investors, but one over which she would have recently turned her nose: the Opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first impact.
In April 2008 it was worse.
The bank had to admit new billion losses, President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: UBS, due to its misinvestments in the financial crisis, stood before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
Nationalbank bought out of UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on mandatory exchangeable bonds, for which it could have become a joint owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet sum of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the economy of Switzerland (see picture).
"We could not save UBS again," says bank expert Geiger.
The first catastrophe is followed by a second.
For several months, UBS has been capitulating in a tax dispute with America and has shown its willingness to issue data to wealthy customers who, if possible, cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return to unauthorized profits from these transactions, including a fine premium.
This made UBS more or less open to helping tax cuts.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in a rich client contest: a halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was not what it used to be.
There was the resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board.
And an exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: investment banking because of poor speculation and asset management to aid tax cuts.
And just when it calmed down again, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, here comes this unfortunate business anabase: The only dealer had wasted EUR 1.7 billion before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it's clear: with investment banking risk management, things are probably still not working out.
"The case of Adoboli was probably found to have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz professor of finance at the Zürich University Banking Institute.
The financial director of the large German bank is also sure: "The UBS problem is that he is unable to control risks."
But it was precisely the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers set out a long time ago to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, but security for money - also on this side the Alpine Republic collapsed again.
The safes of the Swiss banks have become a symbol for unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for high quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
It's a classic position.
The bank has its headquarters in the Bahnhofstraße of Zurich, which leads directly to the Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings here are beautiful, rental shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops like Sprüngli's.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been based here: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception hall of UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside there are walls lined with marble, in front of them are massive leather chairs, next to the logo of the bank a large sign to "sejfu".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
However, the idea of the Swiss bank was sometimes suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
He'd rather not read his name in the papers, he eventually closes business with both big banks, like all Swiss bankers.
UBS has probably grown too much, discovering - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have expanded.
I guess the Swiss have nothing more to say about that.
"And if they did, they would have adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it high profits at first, and then disaster: No European financial institute lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, a government coalition of a small seven-million-dollar country has come to an important rescue event in the history of its nation", writes Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or some 45 billion euros, have been approved by politicians to save the bankruptcy of a standing big bank.
How could this happen?
If they're talking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks merged into a massive group.
There was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland in the merger - and it was growing further and further.
It helped that both different bank predecessors of UBS were complementary: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a center of gravity in asset management and poorer but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money, with which they could spin a big roulette wheel.
With this increase in UBS there are two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 head of the group UBS and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a team of the future," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a person who manages the feelings around the stomach, who has worked himself up completely from banking science."
But they say Ospel relied on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "I guess he thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
The obvious thing is, pride preceded a fall.
UBS employees clearly recall the meetings of executives, at which the group chief Wuffli repeated the same password again and again: Knock Goldman Sachs down from the throne.
The US Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
It stated "League Tables", a waiting list documenting the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS was trying to position it at the very top.
She's already done a few steps.
She was at the top of the game in the foreign exchange and stock trade.
However, the business advisers who have been appointed stress one weakness: there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks in international interest trade, in the talk of the "Fixed Income" bankers.
UBS seems to have gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS has committed itself to an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its established fund invested to hedge risks in US investment Subprime.
It developed into a massive machine that converted securities into US mortgage loans and passed on - but it also retained its own risks.
Also, when other banks long ago were looking for a way out.
"In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there," says the bank expert Geiger.
How great is the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean were more difficult than thought.
The UBS positions have become an ejector seat, and they're rocking until today.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for the bank that all nearby business models have disappeared.
The bank expert Geiger already has an idea: No more investment banking, concentration on asset management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far (still).
But investment banking is going to go down strongly, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually only seen as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he asserted: He is to run UBS business in the long term, announced by the Bank of Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to business in the mid-1990s.
3,500 places to cross off.
That's not gonna be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But so far, he only says that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe is weighing on the US stock market.
The looming recession in Europe has deprived US investors of the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended shock effect.
The subdued production of the Continent industry choked on the hope of stabilising the debt crisis.

Italian and Greek glass in the last week was still considered half full, not half empty - but now again problems have penetrated the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, the financial values were on the sales tickets.
The Dow-Jones index of standard values recorded a decrease of 0.6 percent at 12.078 points to end trading.
During the course of trading, the barometer of the market ranged between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The width of the S&P-500-Index ended at 1251 points, a drop of one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange index lost 0.8 percent and dropped out of trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax said goodbye to a drop of 1.2 percent at 5985 counters.
Industry in 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its production and has prepared to end the boom.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
"We are not an island, but an addict," said Steve Goldman from Goldman management.
Europe will not recover from recession so quickly, and there are other signs of banks’ weakness.
The legend of investing Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: he said in one CNBC-interview that it might not be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis.
That is probably why it is too early, from his point of view, to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the decades old principle and joined the American technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM strengthened the stock rate of the traditional group and let it quote almost one percent higher against the trend during the trading process.
The paper ended almost unchanged with $177.35.

Intelligent Crows Spread in Cities
In many places the ravens of the field are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from the cities, says experts.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been in the image of the city for centuries, yet in some communities complaints about uncleanness and noise caused by animals are piling up.
Yet, there is no means against "problem birds".
Ravens of the field may no longer be evicted from the cities, experts at the first symposium on crows in Leer, East Africa.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible exits.
Looking for Alternatives in Cities
In doing so, conservationists also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected ravens of the field: The use of chemistry in agriculture is probably increasingly destroying traditional areas of life.
Persecution, growing construction, and cutting down typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting couples are among others in the Soest of Westphalia, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz, and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
There the 2005 disputed project of mass killing crows in the rural district sparked negative headlines.
Critics have described trapping animals for birds and killing sticks as particularly brutal.
"Normal exorcisms, frights, brings nothing," found out so much by the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver of Leer.
The removal of nests by spraying water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies break down and divide into other places."
Shyness is conceivable only as an exception for hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of expelling animals from sensitive residential areas and attracting them to settle elsewhere is conceivable.
"Information boards instead of chainsaws", on the other hand, was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One heater in the face can be best overcome with self-esteem."
Mrs Jürgens co-founded a teaching trail in Schleswig-Holstein, Ascherberg, on which the information boards provide information about the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Mrs Jürgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: 'This is about every volume of communication, they have much to say'.
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Ravens of the field do not only use the aid to achieve a treat, but even make their tool as a tool.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently tested behavior on four ravens of the field, how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that stones must cause the collapse of the structure to reach the larvae of the pier.
Without much training, they knew the size and shape of the stone to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more troublesome problem.
In a vertical cylinder, researchers placed a tiny container of larvae.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
But the researchers put pieces of wire in there.
From them she shaped all four animals hook, using it as a hook to fish out of the pipe the container behind the holder.
Three of the four ravens of the field managed to do it even with a die.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the European Championship 2012
The hope of Bosnians and Turks did not work out for the cup.
Favorité Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland take part in the European Championship 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the Playoff matches.
Leaded by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronald (8., 53.) Portugal defeated Bosnia-Hercegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the result 0:0 in the first match the fifth turn in the line at the European Championships perfect.
The Czechs were satisfied with 1-0 (0:0) in the Play-off rematch with the outsider of Montenegro, when the first match was clear.
The goal was not even given by Croatia with 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland reached a relaxed 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored more goals for Portugal.
Former professional from Wolfsburg from the Federal League of Zvjezdan Misimovic transformed penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) twice reduced for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia has already failed Portugal in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup.
Portugal made a tailor-made start on Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his qualities in shooting at a long distance and with a shot from 25 meters adjusted to 2:0.
Bosnians, who did not perform in the first half hour, had their first clear chance in goaltender Edina Dzek.
Former player of Wolfsbur from England at the head of the table standing club Manchester City settled the ball with the ball head on the lower edge of the bridge, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Finally, he was standing in the center of Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
After the intervention against Helder Postig in Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.)
On the other side, Stark made a controversial penalty kick after Fabio Coentra, who had certainly transformed Misimovic.
But after the break, the European Vice-Champion of 2004 cleared everything up with four shots.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended his last doubts in the 81st minute.
With this leaves the European champion from 1976 for the fifth time in a row for the European Championship.
However, Michal Bilk's team with the Legionnaire of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second at the beginning.
The goalkeeper Petr Čech prevented the possible goalkeeper Tomáš Sivok (9.) from reflectingly at the last moment.
Montenegro had its biggest options when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired at the 40th minute from the speed from the border of the criminal territory just close to Bohemia's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already knocked down goaltender of the world class Czechs, again reduced the attacker FC Soul (50.).
Just before the end, Branka finally cleared everything up.
Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not exceed 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to release his seat on the third bench during the 2002 World Cup, Croats can enjoy their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience almost a fairytale start.
Selcuk Inan hit in the seventh minute with a shot from a distance only a stick, the attacker Kazim also could not bounce the ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia was taking control increasingly.
Also, after the Croats broke, they didn't get the goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, who had been releasing cake by Ivan Perisice from 62 minutes, legionaries from the Federal League of Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were in action.
Trapattoni is going to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took care of the 4-0 success in the first game for a preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute to lead.
Konstantin Vassiliev (57.) settled for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the beginning, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that Estonian defense prevented a possible leader of the goal.
But it was pretty far in the 32nd minute.
After the failed defense of goaltender Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to state 1:0.

Massacre at a personal level
An emotionally strong new book by Peter Englund called Beauty and Grief: The Confidential History of World War I (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of performers that your head spins.
One piece of advice on how to behave at that moment: Carefully tear this page out and make a bookmark out of it.
You will get to know all of you in the Englund novel, and this list will serve you as a navigation - as a beacon - at times when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite fittingly, as an "antihistorical work".
It contains several well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, almost lacking ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates on tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, rather than a "book about what it was like", mainly about "feelings, feelings, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and sorrow" combines the experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women in war, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botany to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Their lives are shimmering like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the entanglement of fate, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book differs from classic historical novels.
It alters the idea that World War I was just about the fearsome trench fighting on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with bee nests falling on them, spending Christmas in the shadow of pyramids or struggling with the presence of tsetse flies.
Almost from the beginning, it is a very touching reading.
War consumes people's lives like some kind of natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When gunfire starts to sound in the distance, and you're the woman who's home with her kids, run away or stay?
Who's this coming from?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why the entire war was unleashed.
"Vakuum arising from lack of facts," observed Mr.Englund, "was filled with conjectures, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from CVs, letters, and other already published material.
The descriptions of their lives may sound both frightening and engaging, but thanks to the inclusion of tiny moments and details, they are absolutely alive and believable.
Many of them discuss suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Replacements, substitutes everywhere."
"Coffete substitute, aluminum imitation, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It refers to "meal made from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and supplemented with false wood bone), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato skins, wooden soles".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds internal impulses for savagery and brutality, and then he says about the war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature. Not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or a good book and pretending that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbarian hiding behind the starched self inside."
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon, and no one will notice, let alone grieve.
"When you finally accept the sacrifice, you would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like "the convict he will secretly hang".
Other comments concern the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"Conflict became more and more economic competition and competition," Englund writes, "a war between factories."
He caught what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a tailor-made dress who carries out his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People act out of the blue, meanness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving at the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the trading of gonococcal pus, which soldiers bought and wiped out their genitals in the hope that they would end up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate of them have put it in their eyes, which has often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation by Peter Graves of Sweden, Mr Englund's prose is brisk, but not spectacular, which fits perfectly with his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way the war "launched completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I mostly worked with signs, such as "The First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels like "The West Front of Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming ending that is unprecedented in popular literature.
But I won't tell you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, tore a page from your list of heroes out of your hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake this time for a minute precisely planned raid
Hundreds of police officers participated, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti park should be almost empty by then.
No one knew about the event except a few high-ranking officers. The others were first told that it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the forefront of the event, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
There have been no repeated cases in recent weeks where, for example, pepper sprays have been used against protestors, thus breaking the rules of separation and, moreover, the wave of public sympathy has spilled over to the side of the squatters.
That is why the police operation, which was intended to clean Zuccotti Park from the demonstrators, was only launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were inspired by operations in other cities.
Massive behavioral exercise in crisis situations took place in Randalls Island, which was the preparation for the Zuccotti Park event.
The leaders have intensified the so-called riot control training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers - with a focus on the city of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" by someone to whom the action was originally explained only as "training".
"I know a few police officers who were also called into this event, and they were definitely not told that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that they remain anonymous.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew about going to Zuccotti Park."
One of the reasons for secrecy was a lesson that the city had already received once.
On October 14, city officials planned to clean up the park, but then retreated from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them flocked to the park before the operation began.
On Tuesday the event was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from all around the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with a higher level of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that a large number of people came and went during the day, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when there would be as few people in the park as possible," he said.
Before the troops set off, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
The lights and a recorded message roaring from the amplions have frightened many demonstrators.
When members of the police forces entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many protesters packed their belongings and left.
Police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m. to give the demonstrators time to pack their bags.
Other police teams have been spotted gathering on the edge of the park so they can break in if any arrests are needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the police department, claimed that this was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, believe that the police wanted to stop them from seeing their troops in action, and some police were rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street along the west border of the park could easily shoot.
Police were moving in the west direction, and there was a dense mess of the protesters’ personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the health department, which immediately rallied everything that was left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were taken out of the park. Documenting image materials appeared shortly afterwards on the Internet.
The most determined group of protestors resorted to the kitchen near their campground, which lay near the center of the park.
Some set up a roadblock, and the police started their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp were handcuffed to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services have been called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said that approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most arrests were made due to "organization of riots and resisting arrests," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of detectives in the department, was also personally involved in the operation.
Mr Kelly was present, but "he did not participate in the management of the operation," said Mr Browne.
A second group of policemen were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case she needed to be called.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, roadblocks were erected.
From these places, police developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police officers were spotted, many of whom were equipped with shields, as they pushed people further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around five o'clock in the morning, a protestor was spotted south of Pine Street, as he jumped on the hood of a police car, and a few others were blowing air out of the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, a police officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The Auxiliary Union will sue the city for release.
The unions representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that layoffs were not necessary and that it was discrimination because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The court is probably the last option left for the District Council 37 trade unions in their efforts to reverse the decision on dismissal.
On October 7th, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators, and other employees who were among the worst-paid employees of the city lost their jobs. Their dismissal was described by the heads of the trade unions as a retaliation of the city for not allowing him access to the health care fund managed by the working crews last spring to seal a hole in the budget.
The city officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the town council meeting last month, Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said that layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
One of the board members immediately checked that there was no specific talk in the budget about the release of auxiliary workers.
District Council 37 officials announced that they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday, they will call a press conference to formally announce the lawsuit at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
The defendants will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight laid-off workers, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the city's legal department, said that the city has not yet seen the lawsuit, so it will not comment on individual charges.
According to the draft complaint that the New York Times was able to obtain, the unions focused on the number of layoffs in the poor parts of the city, which wanted to support their claims about unfair conduct, since they felt that poor schools had lost more assistants because they had been denied sufficient funds for a long time.
They point out that while schools in Staten Island did not release at all and in the Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs, and in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx, 46 assistants were even released.
It recalls that at the Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty.
The public school’s 36 budget was reduced by 3.26% this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate bonus funds for each applied poor student.
The unions claim, among other things, that high school directors may have been confused by the way in which the document approving the release of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word 'excess' was used to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school's payroll to a database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Six and six parental coordinators have been released," the complaint said, "and not just moved to the database to the position of available staff."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
But before this happened, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States forces ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Commission for International Relations will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which she should congratulate the Libyans for their successful uprising and American troops for their "strategy".
"With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who started rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"Both parties of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
Those sentences may seem innocent, but no debate about Libya has been easy until now.
During the summer, legislators from both sides constantly argued with the White House about the wording of a series of statements for approval or, on the contrary, the rejection of the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorising the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the differing views of both political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures to stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
Thus, the US mission in Libya was literally in legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama was running the mission, but it obviously did not irritate its members enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The reluctance of Congress eventually preceded other events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August, and on October 20, Gaddafi was killed.
The Nato mission officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the Commission on International Relations 'congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and admirable tenacity that they have spent trying to free their people' and 'praising both the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their allies, who have engaged in an operation to protect the Libyan population, for extraordinary bravery and professionalism'.
The statement also 'confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya'.
Will the new proposal receive full support from the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators be divided into two halves again, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), head of the Republican Party Commission, opposed the latest version.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
This week, the House will vote on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution concerning the budget or any other subject on which the whole House or Senate will vote.
So far, despite considerable efforts, other legislators have not yet succeeded in pushing their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the Constitution, which were presented in Congress and touched on a wide range of topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to both the House and the Senate - and others are just minor changes of others.
Only in the House can there be at least 15 versions of the balance-of-budget amendment and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially the beginning Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authority".
The revenue on budget regulation, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment to the balanced budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding statement in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss the number of periods in which members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be in office as President.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of additions that would guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and medical care.
A permanent proposal remains an amendment prohibiting the marriage of same-sex couples, and an amendment prohibiting the burning of a national flag.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be annulled if two thirds of the states oppose them.
Although the members of Congress seem to be very active in designing various additions, they do not appear to be significantly off average compared to previous years.
In 111. Congress offered 77 additions, while in 100. Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales compared to the early 1990’s, when according to Senate Library statistics, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Battered, but not defeated," says Gifford in her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after she was injured by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with a melody from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and declared that she was more than willing to return to Congress to heal.
Giffords appeared on "20/20" at ABC News with Diane Sawyer.
The entire show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of the bullet wound that punctured her skull in front, penetrated her left half of her brain and came out of her back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview from the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, smiled and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Well done."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long episode of "20/20", which was broadcast on the eve of the release of the new book of this couple, entitled "Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope".
He's been tracking the entire recovery of Gifford since the 8th of January shooting.
The videos Kelly made during the first week show Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar all over her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than just lift one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair, and therapists teach her how to perform simple activities.
He's nodding his head.
Lip pout.
And then, her first word, "What."
Within a few days, Giffords said another word - "toast" when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a key role in the recovery of Giffords: Congresswoman sings along with the therapist on the tunes to "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, Sawyer revealed that she did not remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that Gifford was reading newspaper articles about the shooting on March 12th when she first asked him who the six who were killed in the incident were.
The shooting is a suspect named Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missouri, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of violently administered drugs.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Dreadful, terrible, terrible."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point his wife, during her recovery, said, "I lost."
"So I immediately said to her, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You just got beat up.
But you can do it, you'll pull yourself together, and you'll come back even stronger than ever."
Military troops meet with compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that brought out millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who didn't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines ran past him.
The festively dressed crowd rose and applauded enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military forces, was also on the scene.
"They were all introduced as orphans," wrote the officer in his e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect, it was regret.
Such totally opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes celebrating American public.
The army is impregnablely showered with praise for its sacrifices.
But this praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if the individual in uniform regretted.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way that some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that troops returning from Vietnam had to face was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken quietly and privately among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat events where they served as Marines, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two angles.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and amazement because they defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
But others will wonder if "the evil, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who participated in the fighting in Iraq and took a place in Washington in the government when he returned.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him inconspicuously suggested that he could resist the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning to the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The concern of the army partly stems from America's indifference to wars.
Success on the battlefield rarely reaps recognition in a country that has little knowledge of its own army, and has little self-interest in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer respect military heroism as it used to be during World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to hit hard against rape
This week, it will be decided whether 28 women and men will be tried against the military due to alleged inactivity in the case of rape.
If not, hundreds of other petitioners are prepared to file a complaint.
First class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, allegedly raped by her military colleague.
It happened in October 2008 and she was headed to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, that they could have a little drink in her room.
"The warning light went on in my head," Lyman described.
But a native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they walked into her room, a man crossed over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the army will be waiting for a verdict of a hearing that could have a historical impact, which will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to justice.
The charges state that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the proliferation of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charges were filed in February by Washington's lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time. However, over the following months, their numbers increased to 28-25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed to investigate, punish, and any pursuit of justice.
Burke says she's after the highest-ranking military commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The Army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent an attempt to impose measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February she has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could become part of further actions filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the charges into this case - she has put all the eggs in one basket, as she herself says - she will file lawsuits in several different cases if it is necessary not to ease the pressure.
The defense team is headed by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his coworkers, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek discuss the defense strategy in detail - in principle, the fact that current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by soldiers on active duty.
"Alleged injuries concern the military service of the defendants," the document states.
The Ministry of Defence has refused to comment on this matter.
But things have changed since the 1950 ’ s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is just a word-playing: it is difficult to find a clear front line in modern wars.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly important role, especially in communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers died between these wars - two thirds of them in combat.
The time has come for the military to be modernized, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academys for the alleged development of an atmosphere that promotes hatred of women.
Independently, the non-profit organization of the American Vietnamese veterans collects evidence for its anti-military suit. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorders", which was reportedly found in rape victims, so that the army had an excuse to release them - according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati, who belong to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, it is a very common practice.
Its group filed an action in December against the state organisation for dealing with veterans, which was accused of discriminatory practices that were to take place in the processing of requests for assistance by persons claiming to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
In Congress, nine separate proposals were presented by a group of senators and Members from both political parties, proposing a number of corrective measures.
According to the Department of Defence's Office for Preventing and Solve Sexual Violence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unannounced in most cases, and according to Pentagon estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The report issued in March also discusses the level of criminal prosecution of suspects: in 2010 20 percent of the cases reported in the military - which is half of the civil justice system.
In the case of Deputy Burke, prosecutors describe the attacks only as the first in a series of traumas.
For example, Private First Class Lyman reported an alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was due to occur.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape to eleven different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She took all the tests necessary to determine rape, and the blood of the attacker was found in her bed - from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing, during which questions were asked about whether she had sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify as witnesses of reputation in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the sentence was passed," says Lyman.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there at the scene - screaming out of the courtroom."
"They put me on the psych unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, it wasn't his trial.
Lymans ordered her to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with personality disorder, calling her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without entitlement to service.
Whether the Lyman case and the other prosecutors move on to the next stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington Law University.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to proceed to the next stages of the hearing."
But there is a doctrine between them and the verdict that has been criticized since the first moment she saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine doctrine.
The army is decades behind, because their duties do not give rise to the same level of motivational stimuli and deterrents.
He adds, "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
The only way to change is if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not decide on their behalf, Burkevoá, the defendants' lawyer, will gather hundreds of other persons prepared to file a complaint and start working on further cases relating to the subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue, where reform will not take place," he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
The walls have eyes: how scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous rage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - just go on Facebook.
"We realized that finding them is actually not so hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of the recently published report by the British research team on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, says Bartlett that it was enough for scientists to simply use the site’s advertisements and, thanks to this, with complete precision, identify the demographic group – something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, then they focused their attention on them and sent them ads. However, instead of inviting them to the newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they invited them to fill out a questionnaire that asked questions about their level of education, their relation to violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from over 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online followers of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are irritated by the growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with their offline activism are more sensible, democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use this site to study everything, from health problems to social trends that hide status updates, posts on walls and pressed "I like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. On average, each of them provides three different data daily, making this social network literally a "information supernova" that is behind the development of many new researches. The number of academic works in which the word Facebook is known has risen to almost 800% compared to five years ago.
For some scientists, the Facebook spell is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to harass them on the street.
"It used to be that when you wanted to do a survey among the British National Party people, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the side where they'd never let you go," Bartlett says.
"All this Facebook is breaking down - you're just going straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a social-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken Facebook appearances were much more at risk of alcoholism than those who were silent about the subject.
Moreno suggests that students’ peers monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem cannot be solved if you cannot diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behaviour and Development of Children at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children that we would otherwise not have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The site's information team has compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, electoral participation in 2010 and the National Satisfaction Factor (mainly using the information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the site should make its information treasure available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information to the site.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users ever thought that scientists could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it that information was just between them and their friends."
Subsequently, it is also important to consider the question of methodology.
Even when research is offline, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much information on the profile and posts on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to use in research.
"If you go into the real world and talk to real people, it's something you can't replace," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik takes part in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to plotting two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, during his first public hearing in Oslo, described himself as a resistance fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Templar Knights," he said in court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because you have been given a mandate by organizations supporting the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I admit no guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika interrupted this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could proclaim his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought with him the prepared speech, to address relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, to ban him from any contact with the media for four weeks, and to announce that the competent authorities would have complete control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some have come in the hope that they will be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that he is locked up tight.
They all participated to move the case to an early closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors told NRK's commentator.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I moved mentally a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. On arrival and leaving the building without any difficulty in seeing the journalists and survivors present in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge admitted that he was not insane, and noted that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
Some may find it comforting that the attacks of June 22 seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she'd fall out like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, things would be so much easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie headed to the movies this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5th, the views of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to emerge and they elected him the greatest modern inventor of his genius.
In a recently rediscovered Jobs interview that was brushed up for a special film headed to the cinemas this week, it will be the fact for all Apple fans that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and working flows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and person who blends every little thing into the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "the idea that a truly great idea is 90% of their work... [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent resultant product is still a long way to work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on a TV show called Triumph of Computer Fools, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers.
By that time, it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had his hands full with his new computer company NeXT, and he eagerly watched as the general public accepted the Internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely’s entire conversation was used on the TV show, and original copies of interviews were reported missing during transport.
Shortly after Jobs died, however, VHS copies were found in the director’s garage.
This material, slightly edited, forms the basis of a 68-minute Steve Jobs film: The Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has known his reluctance to provide longer interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly excited to be able to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds to think about how Jobs is perfectly thinking the answer to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when he appears impatiently in Cringel’s questions and moves him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was made before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, and it gives rise to frighteningly prophetic ideas when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It is one thing to read the postmortem evaluations of Jobs' career, but there is something raw and inspiring about Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the bloom of his genius.
He has here his own vision of how things could and should look.
It did not take long for him to put his thoughts into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noticing:
As he learned to run the business:
"During years of business, I always asked, "Why are you doing this?" and the answer was always the same: Well, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks deeply about business matters.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing its efforts to simplify Apple’s accounts.
He was completely confused about the way the costs were recorded - they often started with the sign "standard costs", he could only imagine their amount. At that point he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the business costs in a moment.
How he did a ruse on the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to hack into the phone company effectively and make free calls anywhere in the world.
A number of things have been written about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as a tool of power is literally contagious.
He reports how he and Wozniak tested the device using a pay phone and, during the call, they were transferred from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least a half a dozen times we've gotten into this circle around the world, so when we shouted something on a pay phone, it came back a minute later from the other phone at the door," laughs Jobs.
"We were young, and we found ourselves able to build a thing capable of managing billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We made ourselves a tiny little thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continued by describing the joke he and Wozniak had almost completed. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, making the best of themselves as Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called up to talk to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and it was just before the pope himself was summoned to the phone that the couple laughed and put the earpiece down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett's phone number in his phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a company is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the corporate research laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with him.
As a teenager, I went up and up in HP, hung around the computer and started writing programs for him.
How he invents innovation:
In a few places, Jobs talks about how he invents new products as he runs.
In the early days of his career, when he went to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to put together a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 days paid, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember when we were fighting wildly... yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] until I got tired of it, went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies run out of breath:
Long before he led the Apple resurrection, Jobs presciently predicted that many industrial leaders would fluctuate in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox companies, so you make better copiers or printers, so what next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At that point, there's sales and marketing, so the companies are in charge of the people who are in charge of this, while the people in charge of their own products are being disbarred from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led society to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it is, could have been Microsoft in the '90s...
Instead of winning, however, they made a loss.
As he takes innovation as an art form:
"There is still a long way to go and a lot of work between an excellent idea and an excellent result... and as the great idea develops, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to accept a number of compromises - certain things simply do electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in some way you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and coincidentally also the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the Health Care Act at a time when their case was dealt with by the court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would accept a plea against President Obama's Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm that would take part in the trial.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the motions put forward.
One of the cases discussed was the action brought by 26 states questioning the radical recasting of healthcare, which last year was approved by Congress - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the action, but a 5,5-hour meeting is expected in March, the outcome of which will further stir up the presidential elections scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
Most likely, Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during George W. Bush’s reign, will be a lawyer who will stand before the court and try to get the bill dismissed.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society's annual dinner, which has been engaged in the defence of conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations challenging the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Entrepreneurship.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the trial on the subject of the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the senior representative of the Republicans in the Senate, and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act, participated in it.
Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: These two judges have been participating in the Federalist Society’s events for years.
And it's definitely nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to observe the principles of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their behaviour would certainly fall under the principle of C4, which says that "the judge may participate in actions which are currently organised by related and other organisations for the purpose of obtaining funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor be mentioned on the agenda."
Nevertheless, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas with two law firms active in the case, as well as companies with huge financial interest in the case, was enough to alert activists calling for ethics in government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claim of several judges that the Supreme Court is following the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges drank and dined at a social benefit together with legal representatives waiting to discuss their case in court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines the feet with all claims of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding of their critics and told them that they too, without problems, combine their judicial duties with those of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife Ginnie is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that Judge Elena Kagan, and not Scalia, has an ethical problem with Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General during President Obama's reign when the first objections against the law appeared in court.
Critics of Kagan are pressuring her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she fought so much for the law then that she could now be unbiased.
Kagan didn't indicate she was about to resign.
Boeing received a record contract for jets worth USD 18 billion
The Emirates airlines order 50 two-wheel jets Boeing 777 with the possibility of purchasing 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
But if the company is a Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer and the cost of these 50 aircraft is a record $18 billion, it's something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the order from: Middle East, an expanding gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the airline in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth USD 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order in history this weekend, in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-street current Boeings 777.
A sensational order came from Emirates Airlines based in Dubai.
At the 2011 Dubai Air Show, Boeing said that airlines have the opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, which would make the total value of the contract up to USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that the Oman Air airline ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also known as Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and equipment for passengers.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-mining nations there.
This means that they have not only money to pay for aircraft, but an increase in the price of fuel - mostly damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - it is not so crucial, because the country itself earns at higher oil prices.
This is important because with them it is not as likely as with other airlines that they could cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to an increase in fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The contract from Emirates Airlines strengthens the leading position of Boeing in the wide-hull aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS to the narrow, trying to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
The victory of Boeing comes four months after Airbus representatives have announced that the first flight of their largest aircraft A350, which is a direct competitor of 777-300ER, will be postponed.
The postponement occurred because customers required more use of the aircraft and the range, so the manufacturer took time to provide the machine with more power of the engine.
The price of Boeing Co's events increased by 1.5% to USD 67.94.
The Mexican president's sister was apparently defeated in the Michoacan election.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers helped her opponent, Faust Vallejo of the PRI, in pursuit of the governor's chair.
It seems that Sister Felipe Calderon lost in the violent state elections for governorship in Michoacan. On Monday, she subsequently declared that one of her opponents had been helped by drug traffickers to win.
Preliminary results were attributed by the Institute Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to the leadership in the West State’s governorial elections to Faust Vallejo.
"The interventions of members of organised crime into the entire electoral process and especially until yesterday's election are alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in an interview for the radio the day after the Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion poll group... confiscating ballot boxes, building roadblocks... and letting people vote on order for the PRI.
The PRI Party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until the year 2000, when it lost its presidency.
However, it is planning an early return to power, and the victory in the elections in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Looks like Vallejo beat Calderon, who was still in charge the day before the election, very close.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative party of her brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party left-wing party, or PRD, which has so far dominated the governor's office.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state called Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderon's native state, and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against traffickers.
Violence, however, persisted.
The mayor of PAN, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered just a week before the election, and many candidates for the election resigned out of fear.
However, whatever the results of the elections in Michoacan look like for the PRI party, winning will help the party get a new momentum.
He congratulated Wahington Vallejo and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall decline in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of the economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of ADB Bank based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the currency block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the Bric Group states [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching all European problems "too unexcited" and said that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership and means, would help prevent the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said to the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but she's definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested for several months by a serious debt crisis.
In recent days, the borrowing costs of Italy have risen dangerously, and both Italy’s and Greece’s leaders have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that it could pull the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge to bring the emerging leading economies together to help the eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but he noted that mutual assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union Fund for Financial Assistance, the institution for European Financial Stability - would provide greater bargaining opportunities for Asian partners in European countries.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the eurozone, because its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and the inflow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and must maintain a high rate of growth."
"It is not an alternative, it is a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe to 1.2 billion people in India when 800 million of them live from USD 2 or less per day.
"They might find that the Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their vacations on the beaches, which would probably be difficult for them to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, CEO of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis is threatening a 'dangerous domino effect'.
The Bank's forecast that there will be 7.5% of economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 now faces a "decline risk" because of the European threat.
He stated that vulnerable emerging markets must create "plans of unforeseeable spending" in order to protect them from a decline and a marked outflow of capital from their economies.
Pentagon Warning on Possible Defense Cutbacks
On Monday in Congress, Defense Minister Leon Panetta put a lot of pressure on the boiler when he warned that emerging automatic budget cuts could endanger national security and trigger financial chain reaction beginning at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a USD 450 billion budget reduction over the next ten years, but it is now worried about a $600 billion reduction if Congress fails to conclude a spending agreement.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress's inability to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called attachment would result in a 23% flat-rate decline and a halt to many new projects.
"It will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipping projects - you cannot buy just three quarters of a building or a ship. Moreover, there could be serious damage to further modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"Also, we will be forced to separate many of our civilian workers, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target demands."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, the cuts will also touch the combat troops, announced Panetta.
"Although the accounts for financing possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected, the operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will be cuts in contract staff, which will result in delays in negotiated contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"Staff paid will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and subsequent distortions of legal and political support."
Both Senators wrote back ten days ago and asked him for details on the possible impact on automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a break at the Ministry of Defence could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly opposed to this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panette's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It is only then that we will see whether Panett's letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress to approve the budget and amplify the votes calling to leave the Pentagon off the list of deleted areas.
Panetta has been getting more and more open recently in talks about possible cuts, even though he himself has moved to his high position at the Pentagon with long years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a tough fight.
At a press conference held one minute a week the Minister of Defence indicated a brief picture of what his resort could expect - the shell of the army, but within which the core will be missing.
"He'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like a brigade without ammunition."
"He'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"He will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," said Panetta at the beginning of the Pentagon speech.
"She'll be like a moral-free unit, unprepared and incapable of dealing with a possible enemy."
"As a result, aggression will be welcomed..."
In the annex to the letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant reduction of the possibilities of landings and deployment around the world; anticipated unacceptable risks in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the biggest defence projects could expect an end, including those already tested, and those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, a project of F35, a planned new bomber, a next-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal combat ship, and a new ground combat vehicle to which the army and marine infantry wanted to replace humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters claim that this is a necessary further step in improving the army, which is needed to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A glimpse of recent headlines suggests how serious and ubiquitous lies and deception are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with the accusation that he sexually harassed several women - both sides claim that the other one is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were accused of perjury while trying to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies have been able to destroy entire careers and to block the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately disproved by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using the funds of his campaign to try to conceal his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that fell past Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It's crawling with stories of cheating at school and college.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make themselves look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many scams are we dealing with?
Studies show that in one day, you'll lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers had lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first encounter in life.
Determining lies, or "recognising lies", is a necessary skill for everyone, for personal or professional reasons.
But it is not a social game that is similar, let's say, to Sharon, when one cries out, "I have you." Recognizing deception is a serious sector of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're squirming, stuttering, blushing, or squirming.
But do not conclude that it is somehow difficult to spot and detect liars.
The trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from an extensive and emerging sector on the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be of great help to you in today's difficult world - especially if your work responsibilities include hiring, holding interviews, negotiating or managing people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them be vigilant, direct their emotions, and intuitively appreciate how the other side accepts them.
From research we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (but the lies they say are usually "unspeakable").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's normal behavior.
It's called initial observation.
Thanks to him, he'll have later findings to compare them to.
Notice the subject's posture, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone routinely taps his feet constantly so that you don't wrongfully accuse him of lying just because he starts to tap his feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But consider this only as a warning signal, not as proof of a lie.
People who tell lies can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their fictional story, turn the toes of the shoes to the door, lean towards the exit, significantly change their posture, or show "relief after the interview" - excessive relief and change of position when confession is difficult behind them.
Interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over just to see what a relief it will look like after the interview.
Also feel the subject’s language.
The famous story is how Scott Peterson once misrepresented himself and used his past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which triggered a nationwide search for her body.
Deluded individuals may also express themselves in a measured manner: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or they will repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal characteristics are very slight.
Someone can use a lot of "melting tongue" to answer the difficult question, "Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
We don't know much about such an answer, and it's often another warning signal.
There is no spell to reveal every lie, but it is possible to master the skills to stalk a lie.
With these skills, one will have a better chance of not falling for a liar and a cheater in his personal and professional lives.
The controversial plan for the construction of the oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of postponement of approval by the US government has emerged.
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thus turning the unions against each other, but calmed down the environmentalists - a company in charge of the construction of the pipeline announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things would move again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it would move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills region in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project would still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebra government.
The scale of TransCanada Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead through another route.
This announcement came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it delayed the decision on the federal permit of the project, from which it would not conduct studies of possible replacement routes that could not be accessed into the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the water layer of Ogallala, a large underground water supply.
"This is really a move forward," said Republican Deputy Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
A new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably postpone any decision until 2013, i.e. one year after next year's elections, but the authorities refuse that politics would play a role in the decision.
In his written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the Alberto province to the refineries in Texas, it flows 700,000 barrels of oil daily.
Six states will have to cross this path.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by work crews that estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear while working on pipelines.
Lawmakers in Nebraska, however, opposed this plan and considered implementing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and in the water layer of Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but the source from the energy industry said that the inspector general from the Ministry ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study and focused mainly on two issues.
One time it was whether the lobbyist hired TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, was not a conflict of interest in the program.
Another, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of throwing up her toddler in fear.
The New York family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan house and scared their daughter so much that she threw up in fear.
The performance of "Lady Marmalade" hit singer scared the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "changes in personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," claims her family in a lawsuit brought to the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10th of last year, stage engineer Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car in, Roseanna Monk came down with her luggage to the lobby of their house in Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a minute and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes," and I left to pick her up."
LaBelle irritably reprimanded a pregnant woman.
"In an aggressive tone, she said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got angry and started talking dirty - screaming out loud the meanest words...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she started splashing water on me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
"I told the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her until her escort, who then dragged her into the waiting car, testified Roseanna Monk.
Meanwhile, the daughter screamed so much, she puked, she delivered.
Later, the family sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but they received no answers.
The lawyer and speaker of singer LaBelle are not responding to our calls to comment on the whole case.
The prosecution is demanding more inaccuracy, but the family attorney, Sam Davis, said that he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money to a charity organization dedicated to cancer children.
"The goal is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate Disaster Slowed the Economy
During the first year of the reign of Maria López Valdez, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment decreased and the economy with them
This is the first year of the reign of Maria López Valdez, which is called the government of change itself. This government has brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, but due to adverse weather conditions at the beginning of the year no growth was recorded and even the main indicators of economic development were reduced.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the possibilities for growth of the state economy, resulting in a reduction in economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded at 582 835 hectares of cultivated land, 78.03% of which was completely destroyed and some damage was found at the remaining 21.07%. Main destroyed crops include vegetables, maize and peas.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state increased during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 residents of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing a unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, the average unemployment rate continued to rise and reached 6.19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed people.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on actions taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is linked to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the reduction of resources due to legislation approved by Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally seize dollars to earn, invest or use it for anything," he emphasized.
Stopping Migration
López Cervantes said that a demographic factor is also involved in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people who go abroad to work in the United States has decreased, both because of difficult entry and then because even if these people get across borders, it is difficult for them to get a job. People remain and demand work from our state and thus unemployment is rising", he said.
Unreliability
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the state’s employed people work without receiving social security benefits.
Other features of the labour market, such as low salaries, are added to unemployment and unreliable. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries are from all over the country, as reported by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Labour Secretariat and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa until September was 5,352 pesetas, well below the national average, which ranges from 7,375 pesetas.
Shortening of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in 2011 has also been recorded in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, foreign direct investment reached $630,697 between January and June, representing a decrease of 87.74% compared to $5,14,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry for Economic Development of the Government of the State lists investments of 17 280 million pesetas per year.
Debt
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the state government asked the state congress in July to approve a 3 billion peso loan, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy. The local congress approved a 2 600 million peso loan. No debt gains were recorded until November, in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés pointed to a lack of government management capabilities.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011, the will of individual sectors, including the government itself, was missing.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. We need to work intensively to get back the land we lost this year. In 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have lacked harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the correct and synchronised functioning of this new government. Hopefully, next year will be much better," he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo López said that events like frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and reduced its development and growth.
"Weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore dynamism, which would enable it to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. That is why we found ourselves well below the expected forecasts at the end of the year", he said.
Redefined mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriart, President of the Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed into more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we observe that it is working. We believe that a long-term plan should be prepared in which the goals and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important that all the potential material and human resources that Sinaloa has be mobilised", he said.
The Work That Is Before Us
Chairman Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that would better manage the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to establish a long-term plan", he said.
He said that the current administration has shown progress with regard to the conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Convicted for 8 kg of marijuana
The population of Navolo was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fines for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor of the Republic has informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted for a crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was apprehended by Mexican military forces on 7 June 2010 on an errand on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite station 80 in El Castillo district, Callavo.
The dealer drove in a truck of pick up white color. In the car on the shelf he had a black bag and in the passenger seat a small backpack. Soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained at the disposal of the Judges of the Second Department and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Realisation of the Legal Impacts of Crimes.
He owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, the Rescue of Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, face the risk of not being dragged to the end or of being very late due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work has progressed so far, there is now a risk that the state government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies that require more than 11 million pesos for three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. Until this time, the funds for work were supplied only by the Federation and the city, so it is possible that the projects will be delayed.
"They are supposed to secure nearly 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we have received nothing at all. Even though we were supposed to get a part in July," he said. "In order to waste no time, we have started and continue our projects very successfully, but we lack money".
He stated that last year, for the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not meet the relevant supplies, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan so that it could pay more than 7 million, which the government did not give them.
"The same thing happened to us already in the previous six-year period, because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. In order to get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to obtain funds to cover what the state had not completed," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment by state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that a request was sent to Armanda Villarreal, the Administration and Finance Secretary, to speed up the proceedings and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us $12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even gotten a peso yet".
The Court approves the "end of analogous broadcasting" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogous signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidency Decree, which wants to speed up the so-called "off analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mez, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree stating the individual steps that would lead to the transition to Earth digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed because the qualified majority of the eight votes needed to be able to comment on the constitutionality or the unconstitutionality of the decree, which thus remains valid, was not reached.
The motion for a judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility to declare a decree unconstitutional, because regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter that is legally reserved for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described in it leading to the transition to digitisation.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion on the proposal also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that a federal executive could not structure measures to prepare public administration through general standards.
"I do not think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority", recalling that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of a federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analogous signals by digital is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in recent years. It is related to better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefits of digitisation, which requires decisions on public interest, because digitisation has not only a technical dimension, but "it also affects economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he pointed out, these questions "require an operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the State. It includes a number of competences entrusted to the Constitution by the Government of the State".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical bodies at their disposal.
He stated that it was not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree, which to some extent interferes with the area of powers of Congress, to introduce into the area of administration compliance with laws prepared by legislative powers.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to the figures published by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor’s election is less than 27 percent. So far, the votes of 879 of 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The possibility of adding up "vote after vote" appeared in this year's Michoacán election, where, in line with the data published by the PRAP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and the votes of 879 of the 6074 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a number of measures that should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be pointed out, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his State Election Code or the Law on Electoral Justice, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire during this parliamentary term, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has neglected to publish them within the prescribed time limit in the Act of the Official Journal of the State, saying that he had any objections to them.
9 November The Supreme Court of State (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative power and declared the head of state's vote on constitutional reforms "unvalid and illegal" because it has no right to 'neither approve nor veto' them.
María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied to the question of the possibility of adding the "voice by voice" to the IEM General Council that it would be possible for the local electoral body to carry out both a partial and a total census.
In this way, a partial census of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no record of the census and calculation in the appropriate box or the chairman does not have it; or if errors and obvious violations of electoral results have occurred.
In addition, the total recalculation of votes in all ballots will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in the second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an express request by the party representative and/or the coalition proposed by the candidate in the second place appears at the beginning of the session.
The total count of votes will also be possible if, after a proper count, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and also if there is an express request from the political party whose candidate ended in second place. In that case, the electoral packages for which a partial census was made will be eliminated.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been added up.
His last will.
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé, confirmed by the family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday there will be a ceremonial ceremony and memorial service.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors along with the other persons who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortese family returned to Coahuila, the capital, on board the Mexican Air Force aircraft. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m. a farewell took place at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, organized by his former high school students and members of the team of American football, which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains. That's what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire Aire Air School in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo".
The young man even recalls that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapápan for his uncle’s graduation, so he is convinced that he died doing what he liked best in his life: driving an airplane.
They gave him their last good-bye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, a lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honours he received from Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, leaders and students of the Saltillo Technology High School, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled in both studio and sports.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after the helicopter that he was driving fell. On board was also the secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other persons, all officials of that state.
At 18:05, the remains of Saltillen’s native Bacio Cortés (incinerated) arrived to be handed over through the funeral service to the Mexican air force under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez on the grounds, where his family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers had gathered.
Three abandoned bodies were found at Cadereyt NL's farmhouse.
Several hours before the discovery, military officials introduced 11 persons to the media who were detained in this area for crimes related to organised crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by shooting into various parts of the body and the head were found at the abandoned farmhouse of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 kilometers of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
The people who moved in these places noticed that the hut with the beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters away, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One person was wearing a yellow - color sports shirt and dark cotton pants, and there was no shoes on. Next to him, a man was also in a white striped sports shirt.
A few metres away, another person’s body was found dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them were lying face-down.
According to the data collected at the scene, all three persons were probably murdered in another location because no bullets were found.
Messages were found on the cottage fence addressed by one group of organized crime others and also a number of bullet tracks, both on the building and on the door.
There were 11 suspects in Cadereyta.
The Secretary of National Defense introduced 11 persons, including teenagers, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the area of Cadereyta and who are associated with kidnappings, murders, persecutions and illegal burials.
According to the information published at the first attempt on 11 November in Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and managed to free one detainee.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, confirming they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another raid took place on 12 November at 6 o'clock. Military staff was on a patrol in Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyta when he noticed a car without plates and in it two persons.
After stopping the car, they did a search and discovered one rifle, a shell casing, and 18 rounds.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the area of La Frauda was arrested on 13 November at around 14 o'clock. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyt.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country at the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country at the brink of economic disaster and that has put the entire eurozone in danger.
The Presidential Palace issued a report stating that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present the President with the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis, which led to the level of debt rising to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve a tough package of austerity measures required by European leaders, which is the only way to restore Italy's compromised credibility.
Due to the instability of the markets, interest on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity of 7 percentage points exceeded the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers' organization Confindustria, told journalists after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much".
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to get out of this pressing situation.
Monti’s hopes for success have multiplied considerably thanks to support from PDL Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," said Angela Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now, many of its members have opposed the government with the technocratic majority that Monti is building.
Support for Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong support from Parliament in order to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in a given effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monti started negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organisations on Monday.
The round closes on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by the President of Napolitan, who made it possible to move very quickly in response to the crisis.
After a short drop from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, the interest on Italian bonds returned to a critical line, responding to the uncertainty that the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Saving Italy, whose public debt amounts to 1.8 trillion euro, would be beyond the scope of current eurozone financial reserves.
Monti said that his government should remain in power until the next 2013 elections, despite general forecasts that say that politicians will only give him time to reform and then declare early elections.
Monti said that he would like to include policies in his cabinet, but large parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties that the country has faced due to financial pressure.
Political sources have said that mutual distrust and dissent between the parties complicate the attempt to integrate political personalities into government.
The Spaniards participate in international matches more often than the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish football players, ten will cross the 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 called players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rican side if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly game at the National Stadium in San José at 15:05.
While the world and Europe champions, the number one monthly FIFA rating, have a wide range of A-class interselection matches, Costa Rica only has defender Michael Uman, who was the only one to play 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday at the game against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish football players, who play in Stars and in the mighty clubs of the English First League, maintain intense activity in league championships and home championships and high-level matches within European Cups such as the Champions League for over a year.
To the previous we must add experience from the national Spanish team during complicated elimination matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited options for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, the Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish representation is in the account of goaltender Iker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (lost 0-1 in London) made it to former goaltender Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will continue today against Costa Rica and will win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, a key player in Barcelona, has 106 games in his pocket.
Casillas and Xavi were officially announced last week by UEFA, along with other Spanish players with a hundred matches on their account. Among them, the already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle forward Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
A hundred came close to Carles Puyol with 97 matches.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and near Michael Uman are moving left wing Júnior Díaz with 48 matches and goaltender Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Furthermore, only 5 overcome the border of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeif with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are represented.
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't even exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its tour to celebrate 20 years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the opportunity for them to play Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what the bassist and founding member of Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20.
This day he will perform at the National Stadium at 7:30, along with the angelic band The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an example from an interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the website of La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true.
The trip to Costa Rica is also our dream that is coming true.
We've barely been in South and Central America a second time, and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring you our music.
I'm asking because they literally adore the group here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your sharpest supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry it took us so long.
Some people have been talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that give you more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've performed in the last 21 years were created within a few weeks.
We did some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we got in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle, for both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and her surf waves?
We have a lot of surf friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico, which is the best place to surf, and that's how we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, there's no limit to what we can't do.
We will try to perform the best possible show with various songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them and we are also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of art career.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could imagine being in one big rock band and staying in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given and how moved we are that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we like to make music.
We're lucky to be able to look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the origin of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which all the greats are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
Surprisingly, when a movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We're proud of it, and we're honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we're all lucky that we're still in this world, and second of all, the fact that we're constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends, and thanks to this we have managed to open musical paths that allow everyone sufficient freedom to experiment on their own.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word fame was not easy, but thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find your balance?
As we grew, balance gradually became easier and easier.
We try not to travel too much on tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came because of music, you remember that you have to respect music and what you gave her, you can't get carried away by being famous, rock stars.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something spectacular.
As a band, we existed for three years and never released an album until after Andy died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in a band with us. When I listen to a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and many others.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be assigned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as openers?
Yes, production sent us videos with several suggestions and we liked this group the most. Therefore, we are curious to see what Las Robertas offers live and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's an Ed question, so I don't know.
He's singing it, and I think he's adding the first thing to his mind.
Who influences you as a bass player?
Lots of people.
I'm the first to think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about bass players I like all night.
How did Pearl Jam manage to hold the grunge even though it's no longer in fashion?
I think we've all always felt apart from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I think of groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time. And if music is so valid today, it's something great, because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly bleak character and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting, because I have a feeling that there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very bleak, although they may sound positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or your boyfriend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs are just what they represent to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss in the lower extremities, informed by his attending physician.
The 72 - year - old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, which has been operated on four times and are currently under medical control.
A Member of Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told TV station Canal N that Fujimori will be undergoing tests within three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why he is in pain and why he is losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that, in his opinion, Fujimori might be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times because of tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and other disorders such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs were added to these problems, and the doctor named them.
Fujimori has served his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons who killed the murderous squadron of troops operating illegally in the first years of his reign.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
On Wednesday, Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón. It is the most important meeting of large-scale visits full of meetings with politicians, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries", published the Uruguay presidential office on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay’s dispute with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed South American countries on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community, and this statement gave rise to a reluctant opinion from Uruguay and consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been chaired by the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to establish fiscal exchange agreements with a view to getting out of the 'blacklist' of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are countries that have not implemented all the required international tax cooperation standards.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have had a free trade agreement (FTA) concluded since 2004, which strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been relentlessly fighting for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes to all shops around the world this month has been created from the start to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses is supposed to work," said a press official specializing in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of a video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is the "first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier" because up to this point successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
A spokesman for Nintendo stated that in addition to being a 3D image, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can go to the "second round" at the levels of the game that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome all sorts of challenges and "do not succumb to optical delusions".
This new appearance of Super Maria in 3D also anticipates the return of the character to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this Nintendo video game, he plays to the tunes of those who watch the saga and repeat the successful formula from previous episodes.
Although the player finds news in movements, in surroundings, in disguises and also among enemies, he also appears "playful" Luigi.
Colom has approved Portilla's release to the United States.
On Tuesday, President Álvaro Colom announced that he had taken action on the issue of the extradition of former President Alfons Portillo, to be held accountable in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the process for Guatemala to respond at the request of the northern country requesting Portilla’s extradition to be judged.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judicial and executive powers and that he was aware that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured himself that during his mandate he had not intervened in court decisions and allowed all the extraditions that had reached his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and grievous bodily harm and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move means a step in execution after all the judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead the trial against the former president who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling $120 million at the Ministry of Defense at the time of his presidency.
Trinijove helped 6000 young in a state of danger
The organization was created to help children without education, so that they would not find themselves on the fringes of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organization is very important: 6,000 young people who were threatened with social exclusion have been helped, and for 25 years the organization has helped them to overcome difficult situations.
To this must be added a long 100 jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present a balance in the festive act, which took place in the former production premises of the Fabra and Coats factory, with more than 300 participants.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, jobless, drug addiction, or social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreo was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at election time, has shown the uniform nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with President Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Socialist Education Advisor, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current ecological-socialist Councillor Ricard Goma, attended the ceremony.
The Grand Hall of Fabra and Coats was also attended by the current social welfare and family advisor, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the CEO of social work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was created in a very difficult time and that today also offers a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the Association has brought to this day, "is a good foundation".
The President referred to Trinijove as an example of how it is possible to combat adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does," he said.
There was an eviction of an occupied house where gigantic parties were held.
Intruders took 11 out of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All indications suggest that the nightmare experienced by the number 51 neighbors on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, illegally inhabited and organized giant parties that woke the neighbors, leaving the building under court orders and without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation was completed, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," said the warden.
Occupants who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the remaining ones are inhabited - took away all electrical and partly water equipment, in addition they painted walls and left behind garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
Huge parties took place in the first three apartments, which lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
There's a disco next to the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that while the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupations of the building were unfair to her because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the disco costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the neighbor’s noise lawsuits. However, the problems were not caused by discotheques, but by the residents of the occupied house, and especially by those who participated in the organized parties, whose frequency and intensity increased in recent weeks, according to the angry inhabitants of the surrounding area.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months she has forgiven her rent.
The city police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from their neighbors over the past few weeks about the situation.
Last week, the chair of the PP People's Party at City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, demanded that "the building be immediately evicted and that the civil coexistence problems suffered by neighbours and the destruction of the area be put to an end".
The chair of the People’s Party explained that only one floor was taken a summer ago, but in recent months, the occupations had reached all floors of the building and almost all apartments and even thefts took place in one of them.
In this respect, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to actions against civil responsibility that have taken place in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleared out the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 o'clock 30 minutes, the police got into building 35 on Mont-ral Street after it was called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four of them were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of the launch of the proceedings, which carries more than controversy about fees
The city tender for 16 gates again opens the debate about the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, during the prime bloom of the already extinct Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality printed several pamphlets to support Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the top border of Barcelona. The Catalonian capital is one of the few that are not oriented to the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
Collserola's qualifications as a natural park go this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with boars instead of Yogi Bear.
This was the position until September when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collseroly.
The gate, of course, records the idea of the park.
It's either this or someone's trying to put the gate in the field.
So there is only one question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from the point of view of purely organizational and on the basis of a reflection of the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It's already a theme as fresh as when two members of this old caste of chosen ones shake hands when they meet in the elevator.
And it was this act that triggered one of the rare matches between what three Barcelona architects and the leading university professors think.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender has its merits.
According to Roldán, after the question of the bay side began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so Ildefons Cerd's speech on green apples was not reached to the end.
"We must base ourselves on the principle that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, his great availability.
Collserola is more complex", said the architect for whom the name "gates to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not think of them as "entry into the park, but rather as defining zones where it is possible to operate".
Like Roldan and Bayona with experience in the world of urbanism, MODOL qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" offering "some dangers".
The danger arising from the "uncertainty presented today by the public place project" after the experience of the 1980s, which had in the Forum area "his swan singing".
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"Something means taking the next step", that is essentially moving on.
"It is necessary to keep in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster".
If we focus more on the question, Modol believes that the Collserola valley slope can be "considered a park", but not the Barcelona part, for purely topographical reasons.
MODOL also recalled that there is already work done by Patronat de Collserola, which "can't end up in a garbage dump", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its grémium, that it will intervene in the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a sort of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "doubts", that it should be this technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", adds), which must be created: "Architekti should be only instruments".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex, because there is no global vision of Collserola in the tender documentation: "16 competitions have been announced that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that looks at the area and understands it as a whole".
This causes at least him to sign up for all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the project of one gate may refer to the concept and definition of the architect of the adjacent gate.
In his view, the town hall should guarantee that the zone located immediately above Ronda de Dalt should secure the entire length of the equipment zone, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino pardoned by Jonah Larrazabal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, legal agent Cadino Red pardoned Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonás Larazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal agent Casino Red has pardoned him in front of the Second Criminal Court in the district in which he dealt with the blackmail case in which Mayor Monterrey's brother was charged.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos to ask Manuel Jonás to pay his economic quota to allow Monterrey City Hall to allow illegal operations in the betting house.
After a public indictment, the State's Attorney's Office initiated a criminal prosecution against the brother of the Panistist Mayor.
After spending four hours in front of Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antigua, the capital of the state.
He remained in this place for the next 49 days after the second prison order was passed and the Public Ministry agent disproved the possibility of complicity or organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with an amount of one and a half million peso. However, he remained only a few hours in a prison with moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
During the trial, the leaders allowed him to remain in the city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was given an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after nearly two months of investigation, sufficient evidence was collected to prove Jonah’s guilt.
This Monday, the legal agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecino and asked for a pardon for the region's mayor's brother.
During the legal proceedings, a representative of the Public Ministry appointed to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if the damage had been corrected and who of the associates decided to grant the pardon, but the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal. In the trial against him, no complaint will be possible. Nor can it be claimed that damage or punishment can be compensated.
After trial with a legal agent around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The court’s secretary, Jorge Yanez, arrived at a prison in San Nicolas de los Garza to announce to Jonah that he had been granted official pardon and his case had been postponed to archive.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome presented details of the plane crash that killed the governor’s secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the accident investigation, in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven others died, show that the helicopter landed directly on the terrain with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt forced landing.
At the Dionisio Pérez Jacome press conference, the Communications and Transport Secretary, said that before the start of the aircraft the pilot stated that the climate conditions allowed the flight.
"Parts that appear suggest that the unit has come into contact with the terrain several times, the wings are entangled in tree branches 25 meters from where the unit lost the hull".
It also informed that the unit was intended for 19 people, therefore it met all requirements for the transfer of personnel.
In addition, it stated that no components were found on the ground following an investigation carried out in the field of impact.
"The search revealed that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft crashed into the mainland as integral.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 people, it met all requirements for the transport of persons.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, managing director of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that it was a routine overflight operation at the time of the accident," he said.
At the press conference, SCT Deputy Pérez Jacome listed six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, that is, the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate launch conditions, according to which the aircraft moves towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico there were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouds the crew searched for a lower area and greater visibility up to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are identical, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight trajectory prior to the impact.
Dissipation of aircraft residues in restricted territory:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a flat trajectory and from the side.
A diagram of the dissipation of the remains of the aircraft indicates that the helicopter was complete at the time of the impact on the mainland.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence of an explosion or fire at the scene of the accident.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work were found the remains of the aircraft at a height of 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is sloped, the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage of the likely collapse along the route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search around the accident, in a territory that is more extensive than the area of designation, no remains of the helicopter were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still solid.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has begun research on the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for obesity of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it conducts research in order to detect a gene causing obesity in children and young people. Research entitled "Genetics of Obesity in Children and Teens" allows to obtain results on overweight.
In a report by the head of the Biochemistry Research Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and pupils of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre of Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
People can also participate in research, with or without permission. People can come to participating IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where every Saturday from 8 o’clock will be tested for minors.
He stressed that research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexican State) and since 8 October this activity is also carried out at the Zahualcóyolt Sports Centre (East of the Mexican State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Centre (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to track down risk factors on Mexican children and young people and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He specified that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined every Saturday, and genes are examined (try to identify genes involved in childhood obesity).
Cruz López said that this research reflects health care workers’ concern over the alarming increase in child weight.
'The health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was only a 77% increase in obesity among boys and 47% increase in girls. There was also a dramatic increase in overweight," said an IMSS expert.
He stated that one of the reasons for the search for indicators was the assumption that the population of the country differed from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetics, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in genes that are responsible for developing diabetes and overweight.
He explained that general obesity genetics are commonly explained as an inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they receive an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thus establishing whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of wrinkles of dark color (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the probability that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-sugar conditions.
So far, the information is confidential, it is handed over in writing to the parents and explained to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make in order to avoid disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary way of life that means a lack of daily physical activity, a day’s sitting in front of television, and the use of means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Overweight also causes large caloric intakes, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no potholes in Asphalt from UNAM.
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalt with polymers and creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If paving was properly cared for, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each period of rainfall in the Valle de México Metropolitan Region, Rafael Herrera Najer, a scientist from the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt paving were adequate, there would be a significant reduction of potholes, or even could be completely removed.
In his lecture, the technological cause of the potholes he gave during the International Year of Chemistry announced that the laboratory under his direction develops modified asphalt with polymers, which should create a mixture with similar characteristics as asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with an extremely warm climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, thus improving functionality and reducing the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is the formation of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a large molecular mass called asphalt, and others with a low molecular mass called mortars. Together, they give asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of the asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperature, alerted the expert on chemical engineering.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is an asphalt liner, made up of small stones embedded in asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms the insert is covered with asphalt.
When passing cars or creating pressure, it is possible for the forces in the pavement to decompose well.
If it were modified asphalt, they would decompose even better, he thinks a chemical engineer.
He added that the last layer, called the cloak, consisting of fine stones, is placed on the asphalt insert, i.e. sand also embedded in the asphalt.
As this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt liner and ensure friction of the road.
As a part of the paving, the casing must be of sufficient thickness and be careful of the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to bear in mind. In particular, water has a large impact on the functionality of the asphalt liner.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads in and it is hard to get out, it causes softening of all layers of paving and thus the formation of potholes.
He explained that during the construction of potholes, the first film of the casing will be damaged and only then will the asphalt liner be damaged. However, it does not occur at one moment, but it is a slow process that should stop at the first signs using suitable maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tiles must correspond to the load of vehicles and it must be ensured that this load will not be exceeded.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that as far as asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available in other countries on the market and enable us to easily repair potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing a candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analyses of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to acquire Miss Colombia's crown.
Valle thus gets the 14th title of the first multimiss.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has not reached the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, gained a silver crown and sash, on the basis of which she became the new first moremiss of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, which won and the sceptre took over Miss Atlántico, the department in question won the 14th title of the first multiplemiss. Melina joined the crowds of women from Valle del Cauca, who reached the reach of the winning crown, but eventually were declared by the first moremiss. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
What was missing?
The result is the defeat of a great favorite, who has shown in all previous rounds that she has the power to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain became the Queen of Police and the most beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles have been achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took the title Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury had decided to appoint it only First Moremiss is the fact that it did not convince its answer to the question: "What book did you like best and why?", which was put by Martín Murillo Gómez from the Leamos literary editorial.
The candidate answered the question:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I believe it is one of the forms of culture. The book that affected me most in childhood was the "Little Prince", a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment", a book that is part of the world's literature that we should all know, and today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author, called "El Ardor de la Sangre".
This response was not liked because of the term "culture" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain to her what the individual books mentioned had done to her.
After the closing ceremony Melina declared that she was calm and happy about the outcome: "The world is wise, what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read, if you can, the little prince is a beautiful book."
One other hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the position of the favorite.
The Bogoté journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate had been the most popular, most celebrated from the beginning and that she had received all the previous prizes (the Gastronomic Challenge of Oster, the public title for the best art dress and the Queen Mother) had aroused the envy of other candidates, stressing the queen who was then on fire on the scene.
This was evident during the first presentation of swimwear on Hilton Beach and during two shows before the final coronation.
Although she was shining on both of them, it was obvious that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on "As at home" at Canal RCN believes that Melinda's first moremiss title confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not end up leaving with the Queen's crown".
In addition, Valle’s attitude toward the media has been rather unkind in recent days, and that has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
On the plus side, two days before the election, the international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of her country's social needs.
"The beauty of Miss Colombia is not enough in itself, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is important to focus on social feeling. It is important that candidates be involved in such projects before they enter the competition", she explained.
It is also speculated that candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and the fibrosis that was visible on her buttocks. However, this is quite contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernan Orozco, who prepares queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but problems with fibrosis on her butt, which in my opinion was not very obvious, took her points only last day".
Meanwhile, a journalist named Guido Hoyos from Cromos believes that a native of Valle made a mistake in undergoing several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they failed in Vallo.
The body was never her strong suit, and here it took its toll."
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Assembly, there was a harsh prediction that came true after the swimsuit show. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo allowed Melina not to eventually grant her the highest crown.
Whether it's true or not, it's certain that Melina started her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be appointed the National Competition itself.
However, it will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the impressive success in Cartagena, did not get to the highest crown.
That was the work of the people of Cali who identified Alfons Cane's corpse.
A fingerprint expert from Cali has entered history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cana.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th of last year, a fingerprint expert from CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader Farc: "Alphonse Cana", by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working with CTI this week, it was Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejad, who has worked for 21 years in the field of judicial research.
At the beginning of his career González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to go through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses had to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital city of Valle and after taking the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. the palms of hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against Alfonso Cane, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmiro.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to take Guillermo León Sáenz's fingerprint card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it because of physical appearances, which he looked quite different from in the media.
He didn't have a beard, he was dressed like a villager in the area, with no glasses, much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Along with the galton magnifying glass, the ink and the transplanter and the light, Eliaszar began to compare the dactyl records of the corpse to the card entries.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm to the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, whether he really was the supreme commander of Farc.
Track Search
For the Sijin de Cali dactyloscope, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos showed to Eliasar González at the press conference of the Operational Service against "Cano" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying the corpses, these people help in researching crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they get caught, a lot of delinquents present fake IDs or have no papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and search their database.
The investigator said that in the event of injuries, he had to remove a piece of the house wall, because in this place the thief leaned on to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to get a whole handprint and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicion in a murder case.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although there's no way to confirm that he was really the killer, it's obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A fingerprint expert from CTI explained that the objects are "marked with chemical or physical reactive substances".
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are not recorded anywhere," said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as it turns out in the CSI TV program.
Like everything that sparkles, there's no gold, not everything you touch, there's traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
"Indignation" protests in New York City
Hundreds of manifestants were cramped in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square, where they were taken this morning, and then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of manifestos were cramped in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allowed "indignants" to return to camp. The second part of the movement responded to the evacuation by taking up the park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle in order to return to Zuccotti, both through gatherings and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the movement "Obsížeme Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray made it clear that the answer to the "indignant" to the eviction of the camp, which was ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to trial, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced eviction of the site and allowing the manifestos to continue camping here.
In addition, "indignation" also occupied another park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the parish in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and intercepted some of the manifestos. Bray did not know the exact number, but said that he saw that the handcuffs had also been placed on some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on site, and a delegation of religious leaders has also come to express their support and try to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced manifestos even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even handed them over to members who were guarding the square, which triggered "some small clashes", said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police officers were beating the manifestos.
The court order forbids the authorities from evicting members of the Ocupa Wall Street movement or using "laws that were published after the commission began, or prohibiting manifestos from accessing the park with shops or other places they had previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg said to the press that in view of this court order, the city has suspended the reopening of public space and the manifestos have warned that local laws do not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city's senior representative personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation that detained 200 people and was approached because the manifestos "broken the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it became "a place where people did not go to protest, but to break laws and in some cases hurt others", because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors feared for the quality of their lives".
"The early evacuation was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," said the spokesperson for the movement who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also stated that they plan to organize "big events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two months after which the protests lasted, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will present Our Lady on a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he appears in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", bunny in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now actress and model will be Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show Canadian television.
A private TV station CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs by Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear in the television programme "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1, and will embody the Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV shows footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from Internet home pornographic pictures, appears with his ex-husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a baby doll representing Baby Jesus.
As Josef, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, has recently served as host on the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a special Christmas broadcast of CTV will feature Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York City a fox.
Japan Returns to Life After a Destroying Earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to household consumption and thus ends the period of falls that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have estimated material losses to be $300,000 million, a wound that, despite the difficult global situation, is healing well.
After three quarters of falls, the GDP figure reached a position between July and September that it was possible to turn the page definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year starts in March 2012 - assume the greatest growth rate compared to January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the restoration of earthquake - destroyed areas and subsequent tsunamis.
Enterprises increased their investment by 1.1%, spending by 0.9% compared to January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on an impulse that forces us to use the crisis to come out of it to strengthen, or to restore infrastructures, and it is about taking advantage of the lack to start from scratch.
Japan has woken up, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, thanks to increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
Flows were placed in the hands of the internal market when the yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "save values" for investors who run from the eurozone debt crisis and from the worrying US forecasts.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony blamed their weak results in July until September on the Yen course.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government is cautious.
"We must look out for the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen", said the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that predicts inflexibility in the world economy has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even gone below the average, which is at 100. It has reached 99.13 points.
Athens Spreads Insecurities Again
Papadimos says austerity will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that once again prevailed, Greece is increasingly entangled in the labyrinth that leads to an exit from the major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "conflict" of the new transitional Greek government is given to the requirements of Brussels rather than to the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received in his appointment would probably be short for their application, President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that the new austerity measures would in no way support and reiterated his request to launch new elections on the expected date of 19 February.
'The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26 October', said Papadimos yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow by voting on government confidence.
The package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samarase's message does not clarify any doubts about his position: 'We have committed ourselves to helping a transitional government, but we have no further commitment'.
The President of the Conservatives went a little too far in his speech to address the EU and the IMF, which are supposed to unlock the 8 billion they urgently need in Athens, but he also said that he would not support and sign any commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, already angry at the impact that Papandre’s referendum games have caused, pointed out yesterday that its demands are impermeable: it will not block any aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties do not sign a 'written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible'.
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafai, explained that the inspectors of the Troika will return "very soon" to Athens and will discuss with the new government "what they need to pay for the sixth part" of $8 billion.
The Greek spinner has a little more to knit with.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain’s privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain 'has achieved a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance'.
Yesterday Queen Sofia reminded us that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is 'that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is an instrument based on trust in man'.
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th global micro-lending summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the targets to achieve a reduction by half of the number of people living with less than one dollar per day, i.e. the amount that sets the threshold of poverty".
Spain 'will continue to work' and expand the volunteer network 'in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly', stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, 'will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women, to which these loans are intended in particular.
'We have achieved a great deal' and 'many challenges are still ahead of us'.
The micro-lending summit is supposed to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is to give 175 million poor families access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and to get 100 million families above the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of microloans spread to Spain and to other countries of the world after a pioneer of Muhammad Yunus's idea had embarked on this journey, said the Queen, adding that it was an act of justice and the necessary recognition.
She described the father of this instrument as "an admirable idealist who set out on the road to combat poverty", 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get to know his lending policy on the spot.
The first global summit in Washington and other meetings, such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to find a constant development, the queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned her the title of "head of the family", which she was given in Valladolid "movement of the poor".
Queen Sofia ended her speech by inviting participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions, thereby allowing them to continue to fight poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity 'is an ethical imperative' which must be governed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the period of balohobyte, because this cooperation is a 'permanent duty'.
Jimenez believes that microloans represent a 'serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty', and now more than ever, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, micro-lending is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept of giving confidence to the people to whom everyone else is closing the door. Mayor Valladolidu, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed participants in a city that "opens its gates to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
The CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of universal electoral law
Without serious difficulties for Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig on the first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU).
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it did not happen until autumn, especially to satisfy party members who consider government policy today towards the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians to be lax.
The proposal on the President of the European Commission submitted by the management was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes of standing ovation at the end of Angela Merkel's speech and then a few hours later Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in a slogan: the answer to the crisis is 'not less Europe, but more Europe'.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
According to the Chancellor in Europe, the time has come for changes.
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon allowing the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the universal right to 'give Europe one face'.
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, which is clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom opposes, and CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same stance.
But the direction is set.
Likewise, the delegates rejected, by a large majority, the proposal to assess the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in Germany’s weight strengthening.
The Chancellor made several references to Konrád Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she did not try to gain a congress to talk about "small" European states or states in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of 'French-German friendship', Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud in incapacity for work?
Following the aid, the UMP and the government are launching an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will address the topic of combating social fraud and solidarity redistribution since 2007.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigour, but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to force private sector employees on the fourth day of incapacity for work before they start taking disease support.
Clearly, without the company's consent, a staff member who gets sick would lose four days' wages, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing many bad blood, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring about 280 million euros.
And a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic scope: to give civil servants one day of unpaid incapacity for work (until now they have no inability compared to three days in the private sector).
While these questions are being debated, the right-wing majority also launches the theme of fraud aimed at this time at misdemeanors linked to work incompetence.
"Controls will be much more extensive and additionally: if you are caught, you will be returned", warned Xavier Bertrand in an interview provided by RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about iniquities in work.
In fact, they have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political strains that have produced their fruits.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM) more than EUR 237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008, daily compensation, with its EUR 11.3 billion, represented 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternal contributions and accidents at work, and 54% concerned incapacity for work, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to the Alma Consulting study, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which contains some deviations: another poll published in 2007 at Monster.com's job opportunities website showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed replied that it had not chosen any day of incapacity for work.
Another study, this time carried out by sickness insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of work incapacity was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
When compared with their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone to incompetence than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated between 10% and 11.8% in France against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating incompetence is only a very small part of the job compared to working black.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only small-scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has caused systematic checks to be carried out on incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM stated that at 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of 285,000 were carried out due to short-term inability to "unauthorized or too long", i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incompetences longer than 45 days, 11% of cases of "non-adapted or unauthorised" were counted to 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "illegal" cases for several million employees who had incapacity for work.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work on black.
According to Mr Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent 9 to 15 billion euro missing from tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily compensation and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke these words before Parliament and added that a hundred days of unity given to his government would not be enough to fulfill this task.
'To get our economy back on track, we need support from our European partners and a new bailout budget plan', said the Prime Minister when he gave his first public speech on Wednesday in opening the debate to vote on trust in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the euro area summit will be the 'main task' of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is at stake, added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "in the area of 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for an already approved measure on Monday in order to try to escape the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party did not commit to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras emphasized at the meeting with Members on behalf of his New Democracy party.
We have agreed to the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are opposed to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economics and Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the envisaged measures, said Antonis Samaras that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the committee of experts
According to the report of the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are denied death.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires that governments, health institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives on the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and taking decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report of the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in different areas, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend criminal law in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice appears necessary for a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning, experts quote a recent survey by an independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada has placed 10th place, the study notes that "the medidicization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are told by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die at the hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this figure is highest with 86% of the people who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything in the criminal law concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also subjected to control all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this criminalisation causes any abuse in application, i.e. in practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons not competent or disagreeing.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more than many cases of these missteps in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized yesterday at teleconference.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are inclined to euthanasia
Let us recall that according to an inquiry conducted by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the life of elderly or handicapped persons is less valuable.
With regard to persons practicing assisted suicide, 41% of the persons questioned consider that they should not be prosecuted.
In the matter of maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The expert committee also requires professional doctors to be educated to respect end-of-life treatment rejection without fear of prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires that governments, health institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Finally, in the matter of palliative or final silence already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission demands that it be considered euthanasia and that it be subject to the same procedures when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society’s expert report.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of experts-signatories of the report as "extreme", inter alia, because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask to help him commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the résumé reports yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it seems as if the authors of the report put the autonomy of a person above all the other values that shape the social fabric of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a "manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, a member of the Royal Canadian Society herself, doubts especially the data of the report on the absence of misconduct in some countries, where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the state of Oregon.
Jordan's king calls President Assad to resign

Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The followers of Bashar al-Assad manifested in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria were intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who resists them with Russia's support and talks about a "competition" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership of the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, have taken a stand in favour of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan's king Abdallah II was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the military forces of the regime were killed," he gave power.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a country adjacent to Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
On behalf of his party, the head of Turkish diplomacy Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation in the Syrian regime undertaken since the beginning of the year were not crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said with a reference to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is increasingly pursuing a tougher line.
The United States rejoiced in the "enhancing consensus against Assad and the dishonest conduct of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are increasingly pursuing a tougher tone" against the repression in Syria, commented Mark Toner, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces died in Deraa in the south of Syria.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians died"in the shootouts and concentrated shooting of heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the area of Homs.
However, during the press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouall estimated that the country had "set out on its way out of the crisis".
After all, he responded vividly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus's membership, which, according to him, is a "dangerous move".
Syria will not bow", he added with assurance that "competitions plotted against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently considering a "civil protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favourably in favour of the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime that he believes is "paranoid".
The new special meeting of the League is called for tomorrow in Rabat to take a stand on a resolution plan that was decided on 2 December and that was supposed to specifically withdraw armies from cities plagued by strife and the liberation of imprisoned manifestos.
Yesterday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the Arab League's decision to be "mistakeable", while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while completely avoiding supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifice from the Italians
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start applying a program that includes "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in Berlusconi's last months.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with political parties before meeting with trade unionists and employers today.
It should build a relatively slim cabinet consisting of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the proposed prime minister.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber of Deputies expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament to vote of confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti introducing a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked for time.
In the "democracy, precise terms apply" as regards the preparation of the government and its programme, stressed and added that it is "sure that markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment as president was initially favourably accepted by the markets, but his concern reappeared after the unexpected September decline in industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should put together a team involving technocrats in particular, even though he emphasized that he would like to adopt "policy" into it.
He expressed his conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the next election date.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have Parliament's trust by Friday.
Mario Monti promised to act with extreme urgency after taking up his duties and in order for Italy to become a strong link again to Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesman stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy is not changing".
The European Union believes that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
The head of Confindustria Emma Marcegagli, who meets Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy", for a country that does not show growth cannot comply with deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, a "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorials, the "call for seriousness" and "other Italy", represents a "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The time of his team's life will be the great unknown.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place government bonds for EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran’s nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop an atomic weapon detonator, announced on Tuesday an American NGO specializing in atomic risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from this UN agency to identify a scientist.
Last week, the IAEA communicated its "serious concern" as regards the possible military dimension of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute drawing widely from IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked at the Soviet Military Research Centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for three decades since the 1960s, where he should have been involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by means of an explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was to leave the Centre to set up a business in Kiev producing "nano-diamants".
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was then to cooperate on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In his latest IAEA report, he recalls "clear data that the development of the Iran-implemented detonation system" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked on this technology during a substantial part of his career as part of the military nuclear programme of the country from which he came".
Anti-Muslim crime and crime have risen 50%.
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or increased.
According to these figures, the total number of abuses committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase compared to a 13% increase in anti-Catholic violence, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews, and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6.628 cases, 47.3% of which, according to the FBI, were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
"After the loss of 2009 it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again," the Human Rights First organization, dealing with human rights, emphasized, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", added the organization in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hateful crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds one of the leaders of Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must do more to deal with these misdeeds", adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on "hate crimes".
"Hateful Crime" in American federal law is the legacy of the time of civil rights struggle.
This rule of law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence associated with race, color, religion, origin and now also sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and resembles more Facebook
The Twitter Microblogging Service website introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of its successors, which somewhat resembles its Facebook services.
New offers of "activity" and "name" enable you to better and directly know the activities of other people who are following you or those whose answers ("tweets") are monitored by you.
This allows you to know whether they allow you to monitor posts, whether they log in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "to a small percentage of users in August" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, a spokesman for Twitter Carolyn Penner told the AFP agency.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeated dissemination of someone else's contribution, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre usilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre aninsi a un public plus large avec un manager plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network users immediately in their "tweets" assess the importance of this innovation differently.
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it's too much like Facebook," says @jemb123.
"Activation will help me better follow some of the elements of my Twitter", sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
entering the golden rule on a balanced budget in the Constitution
On Tuesday, the Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided to put the "golden rule" of budgetary policy in a constitution in order to reduce the public deficit in order to avoid any reduction in Austria's ratings by credit rating agencies (AAA).
It was socio-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting in a situation where Austrian public debt, with its 74.6% high above the criterion, is at most 60% established by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than those of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by only one step from AAA to AAA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more each year," argued the Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria follows the request of the Euro area Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State or Government strongly requested that the reduction of public deficit and balance of public accounts be entered in the Constitution or in the law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the 'German model', Germany was the first European country to adopt such a 'rule'.
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and by 2017, the federal government’s public structural deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Länder and municipalities will have to balance their budget.
The aim is to get public debt under the 60% criterion laid down in the Maastricht Treaty over the period 2020/21.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention on foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again on foreign exchange markets if only he had to continue strengthening.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find excessive volatility" at the yen exchange rate, explained to Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to historical values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to lower the value of Japan’s currency, which had only recently broken the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has regularly been supported by purchases of investors who consider it a "safe port" in uncertain times of world economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar was again below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This outbreak of Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and lowers the value of income obtained by foreign Japanese companies when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, emphasized Y. Noda, who fears that this price increase will not kill the yen in an egg yet fragile recovery.
The third economic power of the world restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% in relation to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of households burdened with disaster.
But the Prime Minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan".
Japan’s finance minister Jun Azumi called on Japan’s central bank (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the multi-governor of this institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, pointed out that BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures" indicating that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Emissions Institute increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euro) and increased to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euro) the ceiling of the amounts it spends on purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
The euro area:
Rates are rising, exchanges are failing
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new government leaders in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European exchanges still concerned about the stability of the euro area are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday 15 November today.
In Paris at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax Index in Frankfurt is losing 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
"With new tensions around the yields from euro area countries in difficulty, the stock markets around the world continue to yield only part of the recent profits".
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, a broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a drop of 0.7%, which was suffered due to concerns by market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the shift will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have proof that the situation is stabilized", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This relaunch of uncertainty about the future of the euro area is damaging the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570 in retreat by 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currency backed up after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU accepted a proposal at her congress on Monday for the possibility of leaving the eurozone for countries in difficulty without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds is 6.85%, and the yield of Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to remedy the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by the level of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the eurozone summit would be the 'main task' of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate line of markets when elections to the House of Commons are held in the country on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("Spread") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
Expecting euro area growth figures
Statistical figures say that France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised downwards figures for the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it's the fourth quarter that concerns economists the most.
Germany registered growth of 0.5% from its side during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 o'clock, while the European Commission has just drawn attention to the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must triumph over the dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that occupies energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will trigger a duplication of electricity demand by 2050 if we do not want to rid a significant part of the world's population of an important part of life.
At the same time, there will be a lack of fossil resources to continue generating electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse-effect emissions to combat climate change, a theme that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains itself in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case with Belgium, which is subjecting its decision to find some other source capable of replacing itself or Switzerland, which it considers appropriate to build only power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by restoring the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts that.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European champion in wind power plants, from which 30% of its electricity is collected, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher by 65% and 50%, respectively, than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay our electricity invoice 40% higher than the French household payment.
While energy costs in a globalised economy are a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of industry on national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the most cheap electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would cause a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful declarations about the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they do not fundamentally oppose this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has enabled the sector to stand up to 125,000 direct jobs and 41,000 downstream jobs.
A large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad, are behind them.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a considerable number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lost the €6 billion a year that the country receives for the export of nuclear equipment and services.
What power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while its manufacturer was scheduled to fail?
When solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for producing energy, even that there is no devilish one.
The development of low CO2-emission installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations carried out by the French industrial group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
Fifty years later, the nuclear industry experienced three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island took place under normal operating conditions and remained without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, drama caused the concept of the reactor and inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this accident, as it did in the previous two.
The fruitage of this step and cooperation between the French and German nuclear security authorities, operators and engineers is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to competitors of AREVA and EDF and by releasing the way to take over the leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
Immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the congestion of police, courts and administrations subjected to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of the "country of human rights", which France boasts.
Recently it was administrative harassment, the object of which was foreign students, which became current when the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waitresses".
But so far, it has rarely been discussed at an economic angle.
It must be said that there is a rather broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
To the right, in 1976, Jacques Chirac stated that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where 2 million immigrants are located" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "can't accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the hordes of Polish plumbers in French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the level of generosity that we are willing to provide to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to trivialities when it states that joint development will enable us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and problem may apply in elections, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration cripples growth and harms employment.
Fear of the effects caused by migrants is based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitute workers for French workers by performing work in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
A Positive Effect on Wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants cause the arrival of immigrants to have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that growth in migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
It does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalized immigrants among US Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, on average, to 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany one immigrant aged 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 in public budgets for his entire life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his wish to go for the missing percentage of growth with his teeth out.
The teeth used to discourage immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, left to think about European democracy
Democracy is rare and very fragile.
The European continent should remember this, even though it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, Holocaust, gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece during the XXth century.
Some people could have believed that it would be enough to make a choice and make it as direct as possible to triumph democracy over its enemies.
But it has been known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
General electoral law, although a necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient and can become a "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic one, but it is just as it is and since the start of the crisis in politics and democracy.
Admitting the error of a yes-no Greek referendum will have the value of double disclosure in this regard: revealing the need for a great return to political power, but also revealing the disturbing sense of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we require a number of national referendums organised according to necessity and disorganisedity.
A blank exposed to a European absolutist monarch or a leap with tied legs into the void of a nationalist depth: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would no longer know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole Europe bowing down to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transferring sovereignty to Europe - but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it every one of its peoples.
It is urgent to return the management of the European democratic sovereignty project.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of the rule of the markets and prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will anticipate decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it will bring us to disaster.
After we have long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands a European economic government.
So be it.
But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to be a Republican.
The revolution in interest couldn't have been enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building a Europe of more political democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, on Tuesday at Villepinte near Paris, the world trade fair for chip cards will open.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an increase of 11% on more than 6 billion units in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM phones).
The most significant is the segment of contactless technology, which allows to pay in public transport or deal with purchases by simply approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold worldwide 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should rise further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
After being on the APEC for a long time, Europe gains the terrain in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 non-contact Visa cards were issued.
But big business chains work for two.
So Carrefour issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard contactless cards this year.
In order to rank a higher gear, from now on, banks need to equip their clients with them.
"Two large French companies have committed themselves to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their clients in the future", announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Paying With Cell Phone
But this is only the first stage to the payment means of the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required for transactions is now equipped with only a small number of instruments.
"They're getting late."
"But their real boom should take place next year."
"For 2012 we estimate their sales in the world to 80 to 120 million units", explains Marc Bertin, President of EuroSmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 iPhones and co-workers will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société générale also announced yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay by cell phone without contact.
The terrorist front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-term suspicion that there are ties between the terrorist group Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algiers had been sure of it from now on.
"The way both organisations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them", he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help to illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being kidnapped by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their hijackers in an operation conducted by special French troops.
In the rubble after the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several telephones with chips belonging to terrorists.
A Terrorist Axis
The analysis of calls made leads to several persons in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a northern town in Nigeria, which is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is said to be close to AQMI and sect.
"It's progress, but no doubt we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active", temperates the statements of Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more obvious in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same kind as those used by AQMI.
Since then, the international community has put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little good interest.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means "Western education is a sin", approves the founding of the Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
Such a connection is a rapid success in this poor region.
The sect is being politicized and requires strict compliance with the Islamic law of sharia, while its supporters are initiating a fight against the 'central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars, and authorities.
In 2009, supporters of Boko Haram became extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government's response is still the same.
The army surrounds the city and results in 800 deaths.
Founder of the Mohammed Yusuf sect is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group radicalizes and leaves its assignment in the north.
At Christmas 2010, Jos will assassinate 80 people, then another in Abuja, the capital.
In June it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the United Nations local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now worrying all security specialists.
Now that the Al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the iger and Somalis of the Al-Shabaab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France is in a state of alert and is ready "to pass on all information".
The world according to candidates for president
On issues relating to China, Iran, or Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are overdoing their simplistic and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by crisis, manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
By listening to the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated the harrowing statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or aid to Israel blend together.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the Republican "Grand Old Party" nomination race, threatened the Chinese's profession before the World Trade Organization and their accusations "because of the manipulation of their currency", which is a supporting topic in America, fueled by the migration of entire parts of its industry into Asia.
The worse, if this must contain the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama's ambassador to China, and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost got stuck in an attitude that's "move" emotions.
It required a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is in the last place in the polls, remains incorruptible.
In President Reagan's image
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop his nuclear program.
"If elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in fanfaron.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel’s military aid, accusing Obama of failing in his duties toward that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, second best placed candidate, shows embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China's military threat, because Beijing's tried to develop nuclear capabilities - obviously the ignorant fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
Everyone is far from the Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, heavy weight in foreign policy.
The current president's adversaries say Reagan had simple thoughts, too, and yet he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the 'boys' from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus attribute to him the label of the weak
But the attack isn't easy.
The population is assessing President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to entanglement.
And with arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking to the right place.
Nord Stream, the new port of entry of Russian gas into Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline connecting Eastern Europe directly to Russia and led down the Baltic Sea has begun to work.
They must supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated in Nord Stream’s inauguration, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte have jointly turned the control around the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas will start to flow to Western Europe every year with the first 1 224 km pipeline connecting the region of St Petersburg with the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomora.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will allow the supply of a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is the quantity equivalent to the whole of French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route is already mentioned.
For Gazprom early completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany without being led on the ground by a third State (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing somewhat of their power: the possibility of pushing Russia through threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed it most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", with an appeal to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means saying that it is a subject politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained greater confidence in its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project created cracks between Europeans from east and west.
Russia has barely been able to assert its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries with high gas consumption, whose deposits are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us", confirmed François Fillon during the opening ceremony of this pipeline and demonstrated the point at which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The undersea pipe is made of steel with a concrete casing to protect it from the anchors of seagoing vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the time of World War II.
"For the sake of security, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as 242 Eiffel Tower, which is not interrupted by valves or maintenance stations at all.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were not eager to see the Russian state society permanently settled off their coasts.
"In case of a malfunction, we stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute", explains Jens Müller.
In case of leaks, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by builders, for welds were designed to create leaks once every 100,000 years.
An offshore pipeline is controlled by a boat-drawn submarine robot, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device circulating inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 metre is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is pushed with gas.
In the finish line, it will provide accurate information on possible deformations of metal parts over three whole days of journey at 3 m/s.
The long-distance pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
Circulation of gas is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom, who holds a 51% stake, remains the leader.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased all its gas transport capacities to the company for five years, which may be renewed.
"Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity, whatever the quantity of the actual gas being transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez group, investment costs thus increased to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will come back to them, because Gazprom alone takes the risk.
The pipeline exits from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
The valves at 4.5 meters high form the exit gate of the gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - designer notebook
The Italian Moleskine company, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to give again the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable with its black rectangular plates and its white leaves as if aged over time.
After all, Moleskin's notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo based in Milan decides to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes up the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is used for example for surface adjustment of benches.
This type of notebook was greatly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has rekindled an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the XXth century", relates Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leading person of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is a remote secret production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to build an artificial portrait of the buyer, because the notebook attracts businessmen as well as students or professionals.
The image of Moleskine's notebook includes that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early years, now has almost a hundred and since 2008 has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to a bookstore and through a chain of FNAC shops to small boutiques in the middle of cities where he could assert his identity.
"We followed the spirit of the time and this need for new writing, through the turbulent development of e-mails", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened an exhibition "Zacházka", where architects or artists display their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also introduced new records of a notebook resembling a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand is extended to a variety of carriers.
The success that aroused envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of handicapped workers so high?
Around 19% of handicapped people are looking for work.
Today opens 15. Week for employing handicapped people.
Despite the voluntarist public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed handicapped people is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it daunting?
"No, underscored by Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, who organizes Week for employing handicapped people."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At the time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It must be said that there are numerous obstacles to unemployed disabled people before their entry into work.
These are elderly: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% of them do not graduate, and out of 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are handicapped.
Finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for handicapped versus 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to employment and which represent the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, founded in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are unspoken ways of thinking that certainly evolve, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité Association found that the questioned managers have a "weak level of knowledge about handicapped people" with "an exaggerated idea of people in a wheelchair and psychological or mental deficiencies".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the objective of employing 6% of handicapped workers as set out in the 1987 Law.
The last known numbers, which date back to 2008, indicate the status of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, responsible for collecting fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof is the number of " fined" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 provinces to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What luck"
Before on Tuesday evening (20h45) they invite French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that would bring them this friendly match.
We're not going to go so far as to write that there was a conspiracy between them, but it's a symbolic picture.
Sitting next to each other in the stands of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made up.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke only words of praise to his player.
"I am very satisfied with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country".
"I want to move forward," assures the French player Lille.
When it comes to the difference between his performance in club games and the national team's matches,"it is one and the same, it is justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
The gambling against Romania on Thursday night because of this match against France comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "glove".
The term "joy" cannot be ignored.
To play against Bleus, which he encouraged since 7 years and in their winning campaign in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
All the more, because opposite are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", recalls.
"We've crossed straightaway."
"The power to play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Leekens was kind enough to mention even "proud."
"Proud" to fight the game - a holiday.
"Proudness" also states in the quality of the "neighbours", that France has become a team of very high levels a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna".
"Laurent Blanc did a great job," he sighed.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with the French heading... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he underlined.
"We're building something right now, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next match." Including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts this Wednesday in Lisbon with great optimism against Bosnia (22h00).
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of doubt for him. Portugal’s football team, which has been at the helm since 2010, qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
There's one game left and one opponent - Bosnia.
Knowing Friday's result (0-0) in Hell, the Bosnian Zenice seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of dominance, but it was unable to score such a rare goal that would relieve it.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we didn't score a goal outside."
But at home at their magnificent Stade de la Luz in Lisabona, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of an audience that should create a boiling boiler there, although the match certainly appears to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but a keen thinking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being on Euro 2012", however, relativated the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
The indecisive Friday game in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
An indecisive match can suffice for Bosnians who also need to score a goal.
"It is a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we did not score a goal outside", regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities", he added.
Just like in Zenici, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so that they won't give them time to think."
A good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
