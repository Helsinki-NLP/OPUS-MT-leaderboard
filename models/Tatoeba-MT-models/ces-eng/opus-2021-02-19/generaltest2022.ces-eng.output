The great return of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel Frenchman was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Frenchman, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, returns to the NHL.
A thirty-one-year-old Pilsner native will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
Former goaltender Litvínov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Right in the middle of the game with Vegas alternated and since then, he has not yet introduced himself at the NHL rinks.
The incident occurred the moment the experienced goalkeeper moved from one stick to another.
"Pavel French will be out for approximately three to four weeks with injuries in the lower body," he announced the whole of Denver at the beginning of October.
His return to goal in the NHL eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time was called from the farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL, he credited 94.5% of the procedures.
The Pilsner Hockey Breeder finally wants to assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the world's best league.
He had problems with hips in his senior year and did not catch a single match in his shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL “France” caught 36 games, his success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on his Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose as this year's Christmas card a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan.
Prince Charles also published his wish, who used a photograph in which Camille’s wife at the races helped to put on a mask.
On its website, the BBC news station in Britain reported this.
Wishes are sent to friends, coworkers, and foundations that they work with.
The photograph was created somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color and the dress is also worn by Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing just like Prince George and Louis wearing shorts and a shirt with a collar.
Whoever took the photograph, William and Kate didn't mention it, it's not even clear when exactly it was made.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood in their country estate in Norfolk county.
Prince Charles and his wife Camilla also published a picture that will serve as a Christmas card.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, wearing a top hat and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask in colour matching her light dress.
Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title according to efotbal.cz.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case reportedly worked with the accused former Vice-President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, who should have been promised a million crowns for the league title in 2018/19.
He informed the efotbal.cz server that he had access to a part of the police files.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice Club Jaroslav Třitík said that they did not commit any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia mainly includes its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who finished in the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential red and white official was in frequent contact with both Berbre and the former sports director of the second league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoznica, who is also among the accused.
Criminalists reportedly worked with information that Slavia promised Berbr a financial reward for getting a degree.
2019 team SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) should have a promised million-dollar bribe for winning the league from the officials of SK Slavia Prague, quoting the server from the file.
A day later, according to CSIs, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the Chairman of the Board of Directors Slavia Třitík.
According to the server, the file no longer indicates whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Claimed that he refused to do any kind of corruption.
From 2015 to 2017 we actively tried to change conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, we have not sought to influence referees contrary to fair play rules, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," he said.
In response, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former players of the Dark Skin Slavia and also slanders his former boss, Třitík.
Last mid-October, the case of alleged influence of the matches was triggered by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FACR.
The highest figure in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, as well as former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoznica was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The cannons will be new, but in principle worse type (the cannons must be from the armored cabin and carry the cartridges manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - on a decent level, in addition they managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat-decent, but at the end of the lease, traffic - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I've got a wank right next to the city.
There were nutrias coming from the river, and they were doing damage to the crops, so I sat there.
When I came in, I saw there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I just sat back and I guess the guy didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before anything came out, but, of course, there was a fox in the moment.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his forehead all over the place, so I called on him to say it was a fox.
He was gone before I got off the set.
Even a meadow can be a pain in the ass.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in thermal imaging that almost everyone has today.
So, in a visible place, expensive things you put to your feet in a sleeping bag, and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
In-house got respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in one day the amounts for the respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
What authorities acted economically?
And why did others buy bulwark?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the server editor iRozhlas Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate soldiers and armies (I don't think I'm affected by memories of ČSLA, which have been experienced by older generations), but the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from the compulsory military.
We don't even have large warehouses of techniques that can take up the training, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, and modern technology is still more complicated, so the ability of bookmarks will be rapidly lost in time.
In addition to modern conventional conflicts, where they can be deployed, they will take place very quickly, and there will be no time to train again.
And finally, backers/territorial defenses are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrillas and it is also a stated necessity to deter the enemy.
There will only be a struggle in the territory of the Czech Republic in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where gerila will be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography.
We don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is half of them play like they have it.
Then there's this situation where you look like a dude who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago, runs into an attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss people, and you say, "Wow, what do you think's gonna happen now?"
Well, of course they're gonna rip him off like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "bringing a defender" is so terrible that I found myself honestly surprised to see our attacker playing one player.
First swallows
Covid’s pandemic is slowing down, but experts for the next few weeks are not expecting a major turnaround.
The strain in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is known: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-stinfective immunity acquired by previous illness is helping against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral of molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by a drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, apart from the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As has been said, the first to reach domestic patients is molnupiravir by Merck.
The company ended up on tape first because the drug developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for equine viral disease in the South American continent.
This research often ignores the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying 'how our beak has grown'.
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of them will tell you that they are not.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and they vote sides like AfD.
He's afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing his job and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they'll really find out what people think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, they both have over 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three by Czech and completely identical.
Identical because of the spinning of the units, so the soldiers don't have to relearn where everything is, so all objects on the hair are the same.
One of them is the Atom Brdy Museum, and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that sssr didn't want to have nuclear warheads in its own territory, either because of the safety or the speed of deployment of warheads due to the west position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were stored, not the entire rockets, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special task force arrived to pick up this warhead and install it on some kind of carrier device.
Besides the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolated state.
At secondary school we had a classmate named Cigan, we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he often showed up too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, often went out and wanted to explain something, missed little, went out regularly, engaged in sports with us, did not steal snacks or telephones, walked cleanly clothed.
He used to go to schools in nature, do all kinds of monkey stuff, but he was fine, hopefully never any trouble.
In eighth or ninth grade, siblings, cigars joined the same class, other classes.
Shortly after that, the teacher was beaten up, the police often handled things there, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an ad (old things, something I don't need, etc) and I've often sold to the Cigans, they always had money, they didn't try to draw me to the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, a guy called in a month and said he'd already signed it over.
I say I'm not racist myself, I don't care if anyone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they behave like they belong in a decent society (working, working, not beating, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, reaches out, houses and apartments, messes around, makes trouble... no matter what color it is, but I'll mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start doing business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatick
"The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and, unfortunately, she succumbed to her injuries on the spot despite CPR," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for South Bohemian medical rescue workers.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who drove the girl.
Eighteen-year-old Peugeot driver probably drove in the direction of Žíchovec to Bavorov and from yet undetected reasons drove in the opposite direction at the turn.
After the collision with Škoda Octavia ended Peugeot vehicle on the roof off the road, Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
A young Peugot driver suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
There were multiple injuries, and he remained incarcerated.
After he was rescued he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in stable condition he was transported by air to the Czech Budejovice hospital, said the paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl also orders from abroad several times a month.
He's mostly getting collectibles.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars higher, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," says the collector.
Since October, ordering small shipments has been slightly expensive to him, newly they must add VAT and post office data to customs.
He gets an e-mail telling him customs are expecting a package.
Then it is sufficient to fill in the consignment details, and if VAT has not already been included by the trader at the time of sale, it will be measured by the customs office on the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide the customs procedure itself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I'm gonna click one or two padlocks, put in two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a question of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of parcels received from abroad fell from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to the calls for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
If people had filled out all the data they needed and filled in on time, we would have been here about half the time, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Solution for inflation
See the headline, how would you suggest addressing current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation, and it is expected to grow further.
What do you think the State should do to slow this growth down or compensate?
For example, in Poland, we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable about where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
I was added 2% in gross this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I operate during my job.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent behind bars for, like, six months?
This just doesn't take my mind off how a court can only put an animal like that behind bars for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Isn't that a deterrent to a potential future rape report?
The man from the grave "burned" his girlfriend from the boner.
The Grave Man inadvertently helped the officers secure his state-wide wanted friend from Kosttomlat, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He called them to her.
But he went around the corner.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he was robbed.
The officers arrived on the scene after calling 911 and were not surprised when the alleged "stealer" told them that he had invented everything to make the officers come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to advise the officers on how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman was on the wanted persons list, on a national search, and was given an arrest warrant.
The case is therefore dealt with by the Czech Republic.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavonic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are no longer ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I agree with me, of course, that Churchill failed to ensure the liberation of Prague USA :)
Of course, I don't deny that we have Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's kind of a question of whether a rational person can actually trust something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate in the world, if I'm not mistaken, about 10,000 different religions.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that there's at least one god in one of those thousands of religions that will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
But it is in the Ten Commandments that there is no god but Yahweh.
So wouldn't it be more rational in such a case to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the thousands of gods wrong, and the one true god I just missed will send me to hell or some other place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months of one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All the ACR files could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak as follows: The cooperation between the educational sector and the industry is constantly growing, the companies are hunting in schools and there is some kind of interlinking, where labour is migrated from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing all the time, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar blending should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between a citizen and an army, an institution that guarantees that Russia, a German or a Mongolian raider will never come here again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is something carved in stone, we have allies, and they'll defend us if there's trouble.
Oh, my God.
All it takes is one election in the U.S. that cuts their budget and all of NATO goes to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown up once to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long worked as a guarantor of independence is an armed army and a population that can control the military technology of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remotely controlled assets, so what can't be done?
We don't need border fortifications, that's bullshit today, but a playful teenager behind a remote device can handle it.
How Not To Drown In a Boxed Tsunami
You open presents under the Christmas tree, and suddenly you're at home covered in boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is once again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
A map of the shops that your used boxes will welcome has therefore been created.
And it's not just Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring a cardboard box, plastic or paper filler to the connected store (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently scarce in the market and also saved money, as the packaging carton has increased by 50% over the last period.
Moreover, in the eyes of eco-minded customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such shop is TIERRA VERDE, producer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics.
The boxes and filler material are brought to Popůvek near Brno by individuals to whom they pile up at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have scheduled regular collection of cartons.
We will use everything to package shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we make a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for generations to come, says Petra Lopušníková of Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMSNIM.cz shows not only the sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand in expired medicines, tires, retired electro, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can end up in the right place, plus reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
"The collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places are gradually increasing in it, helping to find use for things that would otherwise become waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Učliďme Česko association.
Rather, it seems to me that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use computers or phones play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
A problem has recently emerged (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones generally just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technique from childhood, but let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency before the weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke over an hour in which he revealed the Presidency's logo, called for protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they could not be done in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and voters like it that way.
Macron's supporters of the spread between the right and the left agree on little, but Europe does.
And there will be a new election of the head of state in France in April.
The election calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticise that Macron was concerned about pro-European propaganda and rewrites history.
In fact, he's trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The extreme right-wing candidate for French President Éric Zemmour is now circling France with the idea that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has quite a success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for one history book seriously, and let's not look at what's going on in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are learning history as a story we versus them and never as a whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they do not have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know the broader context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mouses" did not win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won the award for directing and for the best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he kept to the top of the spectators' list.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like having the flu/being dead for a couple of days, and I didn't feel much like smoking...
It was worse than the common flu.
I don't have diarrhea in flu.
(Only a personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has it that way)

Trains start running according to a new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains start to run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to ride instead of České dráhy.
For most lines, only the time of departure or their route will be adjusted slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The carriers started selling tickets in the autumn.
České dráhy plans to broadcast on average 6783 passenger transport connections daily in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to the national connections within the new timetable, the routes will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Further new trains will be sent by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
From next year, the carrier will traditionally increase fare prices by an average of 3.2 percent.
The runways take into account inflation in their tariffs each year.
The biggest change in the timetable of RegioJet is the entrance to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace České dráhy here after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will be on the line every day with a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations as of Sunday.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, despite planned exclusion work, the carrier tried to maintain as similar driving times as possible for its long-distance trains.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also be replaced in some regional lines.
Passengers are waiting for changes, for example, in Českolipsko, where on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk there will be trilex trains from German company Die Länderbahn instead of ČD.
Passengers will also be able to use uniform rail fares for the second year.
As with ČD, their price will increase by 3.2 percent inflation.
I have to disagree.
Aren't we learning the look of the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were, and they had to work, they died.
I've never heard of teaching from the slave side or from that point of view, nobody defends this, just condemns it.
No one will even tell you in schools that black people were often sold into slavery by black people themselves and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one at school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from Indians, everywhere they just tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them while killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the U.S., directly in schools, both in northern schools and in Southern schools.
I didn't see anyone deliberately concealing the facts, but I've heard it happen before, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (for example, in Japan, atrocities from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about someone's feelings, it's just who they are, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from back then.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never do this again.
By the way, while we're at the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and I found it absurd to reject them.
Plus, the North wasn't much better, as a lot of people are idealizing it these days.
And a lot of people forget that not all of them in the South were slavers, and a lot of things were against them, too.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, deliberately leaving out some facts, lying and manipulating, and maybe our view doesn't exist with them (the YT also had a TV video that turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found funny at US schools was the rise in Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that at some universities it was appalling, the students were pretty radicalized and the schools supported them many times.
And if I imagine that these people are going to be much older one day, then I'm a little sick of this being the voice of the majority, because among the young, they are, and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long since achieved what it had, and it's not about the same thing anymore, has been radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists are referred to as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, so other groups themselves like LGBT and it leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Plus, the more radical someone is, the more you can hear them.
Anyway, in conclusion, I didn't see anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
More like I met with bad geography, it was but bilateral :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, overall, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary from the point of view of some personal identity.
If there's something about people that connects me to interests, insights, and experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he's preaching more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some shit about the coronavirus that everyone's ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they're Protestants, but they're actually born from Catholic modernity and they're effectively Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to Hussite worship because it's theologically very similar, but members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St.Michael's Church on Dominican Square belongs under Dominicans, and even there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. they do Mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna for it due to the pandemic of coronavir, but in the morning they took it from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing.
It was taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem's light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in each year, and I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, told the journalists present, Girl Scout Amalia Alarm clock.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
But usually scouts take the train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes on the distribution of the flame around the Czech Republic.
With Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocese bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18, the scout couriers who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains will take care of the subsequent light distribution.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take over the light in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's just like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear masks, to try to keep distances, to do as little as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just to act as safe as possible, to describe the speaker of the Bethlehem light action Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of Bethlehem’s light, which travels Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
For believers, Bethlehem’s light is a symbol of hope, a light that transcends darkness.
Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread in the Czech Republic for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including the list of places people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are economic cancer, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will make good use of the money, but I do not understand why the money is put into agriculture, industry and overall companies.
As mentioned - a useless product is produced and it demolishes the free market and "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory myself where there are a million boards of "xy financed/co-financed by project xy" in the corridors, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This isn't the support of a company that gives jobs x people, this is the braking of developments where this company is holding up and taking jobs/employees from companies that could grow after it's gone and be more productive.
It's a total yes, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet era also gets caught in a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think online ads are going to move me, but then I get caught up in the fact that they've affected me, too - it's just so sophisticated that you can't always resist it.
For this reason, too, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to put a complete ban on programming (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all crap, in the words of the classics - I'd ban the Internet.
I have a feeling from this vira ma roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that most people believe and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion of which I'm going to say it's a covert thinking."
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
TV has fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere this year has two hundred
Los Angeles – Cinemas, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English - speaking countries have fallen through the trend of Christmas films, and this year they will present to their viewers a record of more than two hundred.
It's calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring and significantly increasing the audience in recent years, so these pictures are becoming more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their name, so there will be much more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are mainly fairy tales associated with this period, worldwide also popular are pictures Alone at home, Love Sky or classic Christmas story Life is beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom of Christmas pictures started only in 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came with a special series, reminded the BBC server.
Her Advent project called Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful.
This year this station began to tune its viewers for Christmas already on 22 October and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Lifetime has 35 new Christmas films on the agenda this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't matter so much, but the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described with exaggeration.
"It is a form of escape for viewers and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world in which we have been living for the past few years," Gray added.
For example, according to him, Hallmark uses the same recipe for his films that is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which, of course, will work out successfully and those two will kiss each other.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, they complement Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, he will not interfere with the final race of F1.
Only 19 riders will go to Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not hit the last race of the season.
Haas will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season he was supposed to attack a better 20th place, which he took out in qualifying.
The Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will eventually not intervene in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prize.
He was tested positive for covid-19.
Only 19 cars will appear on the grid, from the last rung on the line Mazepin's team colleague Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively well, according to Haas stables, and shows no symptoms.
Nikita's physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, and safety will be a final priority for all stakeholders," the Formula1.com representatives said.
He won't send a replacement rider to the Haas race, nor can he.
A potential alternate would have to undergo qualification or driving in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not the first racer.
At the start of the just ending season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year they were tested positively by Sergio Pérez No. Lewis Hamilton.
You could get arrested for this, too.
And no one will give a shit that the boss said.
In terms of law, Covid is on the list of infectious diseases.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater amazes!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in my home sweaters never wore much," says Liban, who spent 3,000 hours over his work.
Silk was bought in Italy, 24 carat gold threads in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater," the creator praises his work, which is not recommended to be washed.
And there's one more problem.
“I’m completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible,” Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he'll set a world record.
The most expensive sweater ever sold five years ago cost only 720,000 crowns.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Women, explorers and drone pilots could launch before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues to protect the border with Belarus and with the construction of a planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states in the context of several months-long actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of the Middle East in its territory with a false promise of easy crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Omicron mutation spreads in the south of Moravia?
Hygiena's looking into another child's case at Adamov.
“We are currently reporting another suspicion of this variant for another child from Adamov, the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov University is not proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county this week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – performed by the National Reference Laboratory for Flu and Influenza Virus of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that they were two nurses from one department of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, and two 11-year-old students of the Adamov school.
There is no connection between cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, four of them have no symptoms.
No one suspected of Omicron traveling abroad
None of them traveled abroad, nor did any of their families, even have contact with anyone who was staying abroad.
Link with the water polo championship is none of them, Ciupek said.
The main hygiene lady Pavla Svrčinová said earlier that the international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, was being tested.

California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in the abortion ban.
California Governor Gavin Newsome announced on Saturday the plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous US state using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial anti-abortion law following embryo heart rate detection.
People would then be entitled to compensation in suing anyone who produces or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsoma’s announcement responded to Friday’s opinion of the US Supreme Court, which kept the Texas abortion ban in force, even if it was against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict, which established the right to an abortion across the US within about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court of First Instance has now decided not on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban was passed on to the public in this case, thereby preventing the Texas Republicans from attacking him by the usual judicial procedure.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (fifth) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and supported to a large extent Texas maneuver in order to protect its law," said the California governor.
"If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," continues Newsom.
He said that he commissioned his subordinates to work in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would entitle public representatives to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is the name of homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over CZK 220,000) and court expenses from anyone in California who produces, distributes or sells assault rifles, components into "the weapon of ghosts" or sets for their production.
"If it is the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets, to create a threat to private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," said the governor of California.
AP notes that California has for decades banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons, but in June the federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the State would now actually renew the ban using the Texas template, the words of the liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who, in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, would be confirmed to warn of the extension of the legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas abortion ban full immunity to judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue actions against selected officials of the South State of the USA.
Each emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where it is gradually discovered how the vaccination schedule will look and also improves the vaccines themselves, based on results.
Israel, for example, has already had a major study of the effects of four doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a 5-fold increase in antibodies, which you already mentioned has a long-term effect.
Just like any other vaccination will have its vaccination schedule after a while, it's just too early for that.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should be on the market, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises to be up to 10 times more effective.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the Union budget
According to Zibra, the European Commission would have acted in violation of the law if it had exercised new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw EUR 36 billion from the EU Fund for the reconstruction of the economies affected by the Covid-19 pandemics.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU blackmail by vetoing all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the Solidarity Poland small party, without whose votes the current government would lose a tight majority in Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in Union energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable, given that the EU is illegally denying us the funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish minister has added.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling party Justice and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes made by the Polish judiciary for Ziobro’s work threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Zibra, Brussels is building “impossible conditions, because its aim is not the rule of law, but the change of government in Poland.”
Warsaw faces a “political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” said Ziobro.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels as would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland's colony status," he said.
But to know about it... in our country in Lidlo, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yogurt several times too, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk racks I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector, all the cheeses were selected, less common and special, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If it's avoided, I don't go to any market anymore, no action, no gold store in the square, maybe they don't have that choice, but they usually have everything I need, and it's got some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidlo to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I've been watching data like manure being handled here, most of the vaccination opponents are just a little bit more off the plate than most of the vaccinationists.
While rational discussions are taking place at a professional level, only extreme opinions enter public space.
Always from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
To ban everything, to allow everything.
Colored cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples with pear.
This state has it this way, and we have it this way.

Ugh, I'm relieved.
Sorry for the outpouring, and have a nice day, all of you.
I was punished as a child by a cook.
It was never about grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (reading instead of going to sleep, fighting with my brother etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mom always threatened that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "caught" spoon she only brought and laid down so that I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I got hit on the butt (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable way and to a degree) is beneficial because the child responds much more to them than to words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child in a way a choice whether or not he will obey and receive or improve and there will be no punishment.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Defence of the system
When an important Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalistic question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him – whether he was inclined to accept the sacred charter he swore to and which he had been taught at school, or on the contrary to the agreement that could be changed if necessary.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and better save them from changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, he glossed on the question of Vojtěch Cepl.
However, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes has become increasingly common among lawyers recently.
For years it has been tested by situations that its creators (which Vojtěch Cepl belonged to) could not predict, for example with the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be thought out.
The constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a sort of rule of governance, consisting of individual rules that lay down the policies of the game.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies to bans.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have power.
Covid does not choose, in Brno they fight for the life of a few months old
Although the coronavirus is known to be milder with children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with most recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik told the New Chief of Medicine of the Department of Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
However, there are children patients who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children in need of mild supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic of childhood infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on the ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were in the department according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, i.e. pneumonia, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease interferes with adults, both adolescents and several months old babies.
In hospitals there are also children in severe condition due to coronavirus.
"At present, we have a child of several months and adolescence," said the doctor.
However, he is pleased that at the children's hospital FN Brno so far no children's deaths have been recorded on the coronavirus.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – it is an integral part of the cooperation of the psychologist.
It also draws attention to the fact that, as with adults, vaccination reduces the course of the disease in children and also reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the vaccination dose in children," the doctor said.
You can only walk marked paths in the peace zone.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
You can see them on the tourist map on map.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the peace zone you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the field).
Skiing/riding a bike in a forest outside marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
Music runs in my head, laughing Josef Kurfiřt.
He's breast-fed with the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer he can sing virtually all repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberec Theatre F. Šalda, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He cooperates with the Wall Philharmonic, with the Film Philharmonic or with the Podkrkonoš Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression of a controlled disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jirous: China is building the impression of a controlled disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has gone on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected criticism for failing to stop a plague that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports a zero increase in the infected.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective aids, and Chinese doctors often help to fight the coronavirus, for example, even in the worst of Italy.
How do you perceive Beijing’s willingness?
Is this friendly support, or is the communist regime trying to improve their image in the world?
A friend of mine meets a friend and says to him, "Hey, you don't want an elephant?"
I got him, and he's awesome.
My wife likes it because she saves the grass, she washes the car with a trunk, the kids play with it.
Well, just great.
If you want $5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
All right, let's high five, that's gonna be great...
After a while they meet and the guy who bought it complains: Dude, what did you sell for an elephant?????
The lawn's cracked up, the big shit everywhere, the car's split up, the kids fight him, and the wife wants to get a divorce.
The guy who sold says you're talking about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that...
World events are controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the powers that determine the international course.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
It is still operating at economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still no military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different, and it will succeed.
It occurred to me, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a wordsmith.
I'm just assuming that ellipse usually involves 2 different units on the same level.
I will take an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas it is no longer clear from Mandarins that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base it on the fact that the sentence is "all American forces", including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are only operated on by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad term and there is no need to further specify it for the American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying :D
Either way, it's a pointless request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey cosman Milly
Scary footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed her down and laughed at her.
Holland monkey also fed sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of their actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate Court in Gwent has now for life banned her from breeding animals, reports The Sun.
Experts on the rehabilitation of the monkeys who care about Milly after her abuse said they've never seen such a terrified cosman before.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating with Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now she's playing happily again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
Four times a mother confessed to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison at the Magistrate Court in Gwent with a suspended sentence of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, she was banned from animal husbandry for life and had to pay CZK 12,000 in court expenses.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue even further.”
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, the view of new people can still cause panic.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly's abuse came to light after the Gwent police discovered some horrifying footage of the woman's phone raiding her apartment over a drug charge.
In the shots, you can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
The next video shows Holland offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) confessed to possession of cocaine with intent to sell it.
In her house, £1,600 worth of cocaine (less than 50,000 crowns) was found hidden in Kinder's eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months, and Holland got a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from the prehistoric three times in a row if you bravely skip the 20th century?
You mean you're gonna take away the same things you did in sixth grade?
And it's all killing the idea of flirting, where no one, honor exceptions, doesn't care if you can or understand.
Just take a test on 1, and then no one cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can determine the nature of the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even scratch it, and they'll tell you they're totally fucked.
Then what the fuck is he learning for?
I'm a big fan of general knowledge, and the fact is, people don't want to, and they don't need to.
And at that point, it's pointless, and you'll never get it in them anyway.
It's partly learning for the many people who need the thing.
But, like, the note that you really don't need all this to stand by the machine, I meant it completely because you just don't.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Our communist past is probably involved in this, and we are being hunted against the educated and elites) However, the price of these machines being built by barbarians is simply high.
Maybe if the press could count, whatvid here would never have reached this level.

Which is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately," Andrea replied on the instagram in Stories to curious fans' questions about what was so disappointing to her about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
It's been gnawing between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move to see her, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! He was upset by the turn of Kadri in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
Kadri's alleged sincerity now displeased his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stand up for her brother publicly.
I don't normally say things like that at all, and even in my family, we never said things like that to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I love so much, they just can't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do this this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed him most, despite how young he was.
I'm even more sorry to have to read such untrue information, which is probably quite out of context.
I wish I could have known Kadri as much as I, our loved ones and our family, stood in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am truly grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what's written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and we know how it really was, delivered indefinitely.
A drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it was for.
Cao began his robbery in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the information available, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he had no better idea than to climb up to the fifth floor and climb into the apartment through an open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
The footage from one of the security cameras shows him walking down the street from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner woke up this morning, he found out that the bananas weren't where they were and called the police.
That's when Cao was detained.
The man confessed to drinking alcohol on the day he was incinerated.
And since he needed money, he was drunk and decided to rob.
The whole thing's still under investigation.
Drunkard climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.

Then they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all that stuff people write to you.
You're just playing dumb so you can have someone to argue with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had raised, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like the 30-year-old.
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and church have nothing to do together
The man fell upside down from 12 meters.
He survived the crash on concrete.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, where rescue workers intervened.
Workers of the Regional Operations Centre received an emergency call one hour after Saturday midnight with initial information about a man’s fall from a height.
Two crews of the ZZS – medical and medical – immediately set off.
Upon arriving at the scene, the paramedics found that a 27 - year - old man was to fall from a window about 40 feet [12 m] high and land his head on concrete!
There was coal in Vítkovice.
But not the way it should, and the fire department went into action.
At the time of arrival of the rescue team, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The interventional physician intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures in pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care of the Ostrava trauma center, informed spokesperson of the WSA MS Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more concerned than I am about coronavir because of inadequate reactions by the public and the authorities

How serious is the situation from their point of view?

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala full of interesting results.
Things were going on at the UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña managed to defeat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who hadn't found a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in lightweight, showed a great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept away Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This brought a women's game of bantam weight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
An American entered a battle with one another as an imaginary "dwarf", for Nunes had not lost for seven years and had brushed her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the start of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her way to victory very actively and even provided the opponent with a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
But Peña did not allow herself to make another mistake, and she unsuccessfully tried to attack herself using leverage.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both rivals had a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Plus, Peña put Nunes on the ground where she started strangling her.
She had to give up and knock it off.
So the American girl had a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
At first, although Poirier was better off, the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to hit the opponent with a hand lever.
Although he did not succeed, then he created a lot of pressure, got the opponent on his back and sprinkled him with a series of blows.
That's how he won the second round.
In the third round Oliveira showed the rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then he had to tap the strangulation.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, on the contrary Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley, who had already put a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
Then he beat him with a series of precise strokes and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now she lost after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's not complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical genera, and it is therefore not difficult to determine whether it is male, female or middle.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns, where the genus is not established.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
As they bow down, they gain double ends, and in some cases they remain in an incoherent form.
For example, the words "quick" or "quick" are both male and female, in the first they are translated according to the pattern of "machine", in the second one according to the pattern of "song".
In the case of another group of essential names, different shapes are already in the first fall of the uniform number, such as: ‘row/row’, ‘keptub/kedlub’ or ‘potato/potatora’ (in terms of food).
Both shapes are written, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may vary regionally, such as "curly" in Bohemia and "curly" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, similarly other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "divine" and "divine", "cobli" and "cobli" etc.
Some of the words that penetrated English from other languages were originally inflexible, but gradually they adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is both male and female, or the word "bufet", which remained inflexible in the middle family, but in the male family it has endings according to the pattern of "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants who are trying to move on to Europe.
Thousands of people began to travel to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians are promising to support Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to go on a uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We haven't seen blue skies in three months, and we've been choking, describing a journalist from Sydney.
The devastating fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the inhabitants themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent drastic effects, as critics claim?
And what will the countries have to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a journalist from Sydney Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been, and they're pretty rare.
That's why everyone's always written about everywhere.
It's unpleasant for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they're trying to book it.
I don't personally know anyone who's been framed.
But I know a lot of people who were raped, and I've seen how they're often treated by their surroundings or even by the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that the victims are finally opening up to their traumas.
Still too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who will be falsely accused.
It's gross and spit in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but spreading the idea that "a large part of the charge is fictional" and that it's "trend" you only help sex offenders.
Czech Republic floods built houses, families have no money to finish
Construction material prices have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have been put in a difficult situation.
Because it does not have the means to complete the built-up family houses, and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already built family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the better case, people move into undeveloped and unconstructed homes.
In the worse case, the buildings are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them, because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and pay rent," says Štěpán Křeček, economist BHS.
In a year, we build two or three family houses, and 50 percent of it happened to us.
As a construction company, it's hard for us to keep some things contractually, even though the material has been more expensive.
So we do without any profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they're counting on building a house worth $5 million, now it's gonna cost them seven.
I think some of them will be waiting," he said.
Copper, iron, and plumbing and heating equipment were the most eroded from the material.
Construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of construction fields are missing, and the influx of foreign workers is holding back pandemics.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issue of a building permit is more favourable.
"The construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're fine, and we're gonna be even better.
Real visions are missing, says the commentator CRO – myRozhlas
In addition to classical celebrations, the accession to the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, apart from the Prime Minister and President YES Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, both the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
As I find my thesis super cool, I have my own topic that I chose, I follow up with my bachelor, I always work on it all year round, and then in a week or two, I write down the written part.
The state statesmen are at peace with us, unless you're a total worker and something's left in his head, the committee won't overwhelm him for a theory.
For example, I was studying for a week at state school, and when I was at the end of my life, the committee always tried to lead me on to some logical derivation that came right to me, and I had it right.
Otherwise, about these projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we've done it a lot, really beneficial, learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they've done it.
I think it's great when at the end of the course there's a test that shows the knowledge acquired within the project, not just the defense.
But don't overwhelm your e-mails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be as much a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they'd risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something might happen to them.
But you can build a statue of Putin next to a statue of Pooh Bear.
Maybe you put it in a way to touch Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws sticks at artists.
Once you don't give up stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your ranges will go down to the bare minimum.
Plus, it keeps changing what kind of function is more important, like, comment or saving.
It's been pissing me off lately, so I might have to lower myself to the tick, where a lot of artists in my line of work are successful and barely willing to let it happen.
In the end, I might even like something user-friendly that doesn't suck all creativity and energy out of artists.
Declaration by the Workers' Party on Donbase
The union – yes, breaking – no, the opponents of the SSSR breaking express their opinion on the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
In the White Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevich, without any legal powers and violations of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open clemency of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "The Union of the Union as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one cut of the pen, they “returned” a huge country with nearly 300 million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia’s population has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the past 70 years in one sitting in the White Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created by the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately deindustrialized, hindered agriculture, separated fourteen republics from the world's greatest power, which had previously been economically linked into one mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the poorness of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all resulting from geopolitical surrender, the surrender of first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "vacuum of strength".
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste quickly filled and conquered NATO countries that adopted our geopolitical surrender.
And to this day, the whole world is shaken mainly because of events from the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with a large turnover may not correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to put it in the fridge, and I'm going to make it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternate reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday, the chain will lower it to CZK 99 / kg - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to CZK 69 / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by CZK 120 and leave it three days in my fridge?
I'll answer my own questions - nothing.
All this crap about when something's cheap, it's got to be definitely bad, bad or bad quality, they're so retarded, to tell you the truth;-)
I just recently went to Hlavs in Brno and there was a brochure in the underpass of the ladies, and I always take things like that to help the temps, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views of the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I knew it was going to be some sort of an agitation.
After I finished reading, I found out who was publishing it, and then Scientology came out.
Well, like good stuff, full of completely useless lessons, like washing up and not being a cunt.
It's a waste of paper, because of this, the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to accommodate that person because you love him without realizing how much the situation is.
She threatened me several times to hurt herself because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It's been a great relationship for a year, but then another six months went by, and then she started going off on her head.
Then I ended the relationship with the one that I told her that I was breaking up and he lied to her, but that we could talk about it next week to calm her down and not get any more vibes.
Such a person will suck out your feelings, emotions, and overall joy.
You'd better keep your distance.
When the insurance companies are ripping off here furiously by buying a cloud of tests and hurrying for positive ones who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're accomplishing is a complication for companies, carriers, and others, because their employees in the random number generator have been grounded for five days.
In the west, they've already stopped the clowning and admitted there's no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he has to steal something else and drive his ego by inventing bozos.
I see we've got a good old bastard coming back.
After several years of attenuating and suppressing this unfair business, MLM recruiting is once again returning to the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), initial promises about training products and business skills quickly shifted to "that's none of your business, especially get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products that I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and talk people.
When the first money came, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to fish up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, which made one feel like a door-to-door pot salesman.
What I can say, though, was a valuable experience, one learned not to jump on every fat and thoroughly examine the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in the same bag.
People are successful in this business and even good for people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I've never seen many of these things in a corporation where I work.
HR's cool, managers mind their own management, and they don't put much of their noses into anything.
Regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form that happens with us it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, we will see what came out and what didn't) - it is more self-evaluation than someone would evaluate you by some numbers, etc.
Corporate events also optional.
But we're also a little unique within our company - there's a department that's more corporate.
Sometimes you feel like we're almost-starting, squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works that way, they don't bother us much as long as the results are.
A Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police searched for the missing 32-year-old Czech woman, who was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Foreign Minister announced in his resignation Jakub Kulhánek on social media that a woman from Hungary had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
Cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not disclose more information about the case.
My condolences, he posted on Twitter Kulhánek.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on November 28th on her way home from work, and before boarding, she was to pick up the cash from the ATM.
She was reported missing by her colleagues at work five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, Interpol listed her as a missing person around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case, and what he suspected, but did not disclose.
At the end of the year, new councils were assigned in four municipalities
On Saturday, 11 December, a new council was elected in the villages of Komňa na Uherskohradiště, Lužice na Mostecku, Nová Ves na Liberecku and Rádá na Pelhřimovku.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected council has broken down.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates applied for 28 mandates.
The vote reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rádná, where 93.62% of the eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men gained the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest is 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men applying for 28 representative posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, a very monitored election to the Chamber of Deputies.
Eva Krumpová, the first Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed us most of the time in more demanding epidemiological conditions, which imposed greater demands on equipment and personnel security.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 3:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to cope with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous infectious disease here at the very beginning, but it went well without any major hiccups.
Dealing with how idiotic a large part of the population on all its layers is about it, I have a problem with it so far.
I look forward to vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to him I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not assholes.
He would be deprived of his office as President and his ability to retake her.
The chances of that actually happening are, as others say, very small.
Besides, I'm not even sure shredding a file would be considered treason.
High treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: The number of people under the age of 35 who are without sex all year long grows
More and more young adults in the US live their lives without sex.
They are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people younger than 35 who renounce sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between 18 and 35 years of age who have reported that they have not had sexual intercourse in the last year is more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, showed the study of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic impacts of the coronavir pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks, or video games that make sex less and less a priority for young people could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age has been growing rapidly, stating that they have not had sex in the previous year," said researcher IFS Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among married people; in 2021, only 5% of them reported that they had been without sex in the last year.
Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious foundation also contribute to the loss of sexual activity.
Although the spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married persons under the age of 35 still declines.
Young people are divided by premarital sex, about 30% thinks it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among single individuals in this age group there are minors, but their behavior shifts this trend," Stone says about these 30%.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital relations, religious foundation is the reason.
Since 2008, the ratio of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60% for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less believers" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and mainly social alcohol drinking during pandemic times, also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that sex is less likely for people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be to expand digital media, which seem to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replaceing” this need.
This trend was mainly followed by a lockdown at the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole command of vaccination against covid is about whether society should force a part of the population into behavior that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question that I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether if we don't order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80-year-old who didn't really know, we didn't explain it to him well, he heard some disinformation, and as a result, he didn't give himself a shot, and he finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we're responsible for the death of an accursed anti-vaccination offender who's here at the side of the SPD and the PC shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the other group, so they will really be responsible for this themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up to fight drought?
This year's winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic so far.
Operators of ski resorts can not do without technical snow, weather also complicates the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story to tell, but it's not about a churchboy.
One day in high school, our teacher led us all the way across town to the shipyard so we could go for a boat ride on the river.
On the way there we walked down one quite wide street and who we do not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but I had a conversation with a friend.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
There's not much going on, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honours.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis, caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border, is worth addressing with the use of diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the “Normanda Group”, bringing France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine together.
Morawiecki said that he informed the Chancellor of the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and used people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we record a hundred attempts to cross the border (illegal).
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor so that Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of the Lukashenko regime with refugees.
A drunken Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it.
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but another nun tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver’s license for not giving her priority in driving and driving away from the scene of the accident, the truth came out, TVN24 said.
She admitted that another nun hit the vehicle and asked her for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestine.
They gave her a breath test and immediately took her driver’s license after they found out she had more than two mills in her blood.
At the same time, she was told that she would confess her actions in court.
Dog Hugo's doing the best he can.
But Juraj Shaymovich did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen American stories about dogs.
But in doing so, they forgot the important thing: the laws of the film craft.
After a cheesy film by F. Brabce Gump - the dog who taught people to live, the audience emotions in the cinemas are now running for another film Here we watch.
The co-author of the script and the director in one person Juraj Shajmovich Jr. is loosely following up on his previous film Here I am watching from 2012.
On the scene returns talking dachshund Hugo and some famous characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, owners of the Šumava guesthouse, who is dying, and so they start calling him a dogger, Julie's father with a partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director with her partner Beatriz Shajmovicova (who is also a film producer) struggled with the storytelling procedures already in the previous dog picture, but there were at least entertained children and dogs.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker scenario that evokes a mixture of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's review.
Julie, although a scientist, is subject to dark delusions in her desire for a child and when the proper "constellation" comes, she is copulating with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined – on the hood of a car or church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), the retired Colonel Mojmir, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia), who falls into a coma, then is taken away from the hospital by the family, so that in the heart of Šumava solitude can take place a miraculous process of dog healing.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pet animals.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer wonders, though, what a content pelmel full of incredulous situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, dog contests, a Šumava charlatan, cops arriving to report looking for “drugs” and discussing herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal – and which the baked family in the guest house will of course get drunk.
When a heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and then sits in a tufted and makeup with a cigarette at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and slacks as a cured vegetarian, you can't laugh.
On top of that, the viewer explains that “this happens sometimes after a coma.”
Sajmovic's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of work with text, ability to build load-bearing situations, a sense of character and point and overhead management.
Actors' performances are unbalanced, the cut is baffled and the overall impression is wrong.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand up for their party, they have little to play.
Poetic shots of the Šumava nature of cameraman Vladimír Holomek and two dachshunds remain the only set of the film.
It is not enough to draw a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone more popular vulgar expressions by which the characters commit themselves.
The argument is not even an old membership of the Dachshund Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
Good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of a man with a dog must include knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
There's a little too much erotic and minimal feeling for the genre for a good family picture.
Even as a canisterapia ad, this amateur-like piece of shit wouldn't go through.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, you can see how you understand shit, but that's just because you never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to kids like that all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which case the brigade for the profit.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time in a year when it rains.
"The total absence of rainfall during November, as we noted at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Weather Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas scene, the inhabitants of Nazareth were happy Wasím Ashkar.
The rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, they are impacting and irregular.
The winter rains depend on the forests.
Without them, they dry and are prone to fires.
It is not only about the forests, but also about the supply of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, Lake Galilee, was filled to the brim with the last three rainy winters this spring.
Since then, the level's been dropping.
Water managers warned about the drought a long time ago.
"It is to be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a reduction," the spokesperson for the Uri Schor Water Management Authority predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or recycling of waste water.
Economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there are increasing tankers.
Water ducts and private wells are drying out.
"This year my orders increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years," Sulejman reported in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, there were clashes between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed was completely waterless.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Action Against Iran
The Israeli Minister of Defence stated that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring “any progress” and that he informed Washington of the preparations for the attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz stated on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to persuade Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida Gantz, he said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring “any progress” and the world’s powers “understand that the Iranians are playing with them.”
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I've been prying the lady a little bit and grilling her interview to see what she wants me to do.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, so I made a little more doubt and questions and finally thanked and left.
You can tell me I'm a punk, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, waiting for them enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first greater strain of those interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the week there is no need for snow and some ski areas have started operation.
She did not discourage the rider or the obligation to prove herself in the lifts with the Covid certificate.
While ski lifters do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rentals report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went into the cross-country trails and the slopes on the weekend.
The skiers enjoyed the weather, which today offered excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports complex, praised the interest.
Hundreds of people went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the Centre in Branná na Šumpersku were opened.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today came an estimated 400 people.
The terms are great.
The sun was shining today, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praise of the representative ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski-area operators can only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or who are within a period of time after losing their covid-19 disease.
Except for the exceptions, people are prepared for this and prove the necessary documents, told ČTK René Hroneš from the ski centre Špindlerův Mlýn.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski rentals and shops.
Fortunately, there is an interest in ski rental.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava shop Skiopava.
More pressure is expected during the ski course period.
The director of Snowbear, David Shinták, is also feeling that there is no interest in renting ski equipment as before because of Covid.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowing.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, said ČTK Šinták.
According to him, people got lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by a rental in Novako on Boží Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and interested parties must order them in advance.
"We start lending this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a great deal of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also a ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, we must have the opportunity to live a quality life abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
There are clever and clever people who leave abroad who have no property.
The owner of the company isn't going anywhere.
But he's totally in agreement with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one beautiful day, reigning for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the election at all.
If things get bad around here, some traditional V4 freak can win here, too.
The young and educated will leave, remain his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood for a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic was in full swing autumn, in Thailand the crew of the film Ostrov led by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody picture of the face on social media.
Is this a real injury, or is this a filming trial?
London police are still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is nothing like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor, of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, around 19:45 and headed home to Camberwell.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her coworkers on December 3rd.
According to British media, she was a nurse's assistant at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to Guy's and St Thomas' hospital.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical establishments said in the tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help find her to contact the police," continued the message.
The public also calls for cooperation from Mrs Harriet Harman, who pointed out the Srnc case at a press conference on Saturday.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are of course worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a special responsibility to try to find her, because she was out of her native country, away from her family and worked here for our health care," said Harman.
Police have previously detained a man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC news site, however, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man was suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
That's not how I underestimate Ukraine.
These aren't "big quantities", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of the invasion and starting to get sick of our entry.
I was quoting upstairs.
I don't know what made you think that Russia wanted a war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is out on so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare that to the first Punic war and the "anexie" of sicilia :D
I imagine that, after Ukraine announced that it was not going to comply with the agreements from Minsk, Russia annexed those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would be.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague since Sunday, they will touch mainly suburban connections
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, which relate mainly to suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslav is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday stop express trains from České Budějovice in the station Garden City.
In the suburban train transport, trains S7, which pass through Prague's main railway station on the route from Beroun to České Brod.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will be stopping at the recently opened station Praha-Zahradní Město.
PID will newly spread to other areas.
Among other things, buses will take you to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Old Splavů and Turnov.
Buses in Mladoboleslav will be included, including lines with a transfer to the Liberec and Hradec Králové Region.
During integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operations will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will come out of Zličín in Prague, which will go all the way to Žatec.
There was also a new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník, when the express line number 404 will start.
The new PID system includes lines 400 and 410 travelling to the Liberec Region.
They leave from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The return line 400 goes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoně and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the new operation is cancelled or restricted on dozens of Central Bohemian local lines, including Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín.
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Praha – Beroun, Praha – Lysá nad Labem and near Kolín.
Changes are also waiting for passengers in other places.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or the section from Dobříš is extended with connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko.
The route of lines 540 to 543 in Nymbursk was changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Horovicka in the Pilsen Region are modified.
Healthy snack/ lunch at the supermarket office
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only way to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little bit further to Lidlo.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to practice after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I'll buy pizza buns and yogurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a metre of snow like you, that's how it is.
And it's not the trees you need to see.
Only the top of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they forbid us to ride off slopes, but it's one of them.
Confession of Dara about the relationship with the Bear: I wasn’t looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has lived nothing but a revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been hanging out since summer, and the famous football player even got a divorce for the singer.
Dara now sent a comprehensive message to the fans explaining why she had kept her love from them for six months.
"I allow myself to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, i.e. sorry, Nedvěd," Dara Rolins joked, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player.
They say he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are accustomed to public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse.
Whether those who don't care at all, and it's coming out of the can, or us, whose lives are being dissected in detail.
It's like one of you wants to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are really good for each other, or you insisted that everyone really knows the list of your former partners and was familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's cool, that's what you want, that's what bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
The bear has long served as vice president of Juventus Football Club.
They didn't come out with the truth until now because they were waiting for Ned's divorce to end.
He and his wife Ivana were separated for three years, not married in paper form but only three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We're just people too, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and like him by me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, she shut down Rolins.
Hey, the other commentators probably already said everything, just confirming that colleges are great until the beginning, my classmates usually met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found subleases together, which seems like the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments aren't usually advertised too long in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but it won't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, avoid not only Cejla, but also the surroundings (streets such as Vranovská, French etc., that is a very bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student, the King's Field and it's fine that way, except it's close to most BUT faculties (I don't know where you're going exactly).
I never got rent, but I'm a native of the Brno, so I can maybe advise Brno as such if you lack any more information :)
What an example of "normal" thinking.
In fact, because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is quite all right that the state is not funding enough for some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it on their own, or they go by the state and they pay for it.
We cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he will raise a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution and that will enable him to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim somewhat loses weight when written by a person who, two days earlier, expressed himself in this way about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a voice against someone having an abortion is the same as a voice against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise I have already experienced during cataloging/digitalization that (and even long-time professionals) it will either throw it from the eye somehow, or write something in the form of xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and in the note that it is illegible.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I don't really recommend it.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note based on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look up some sign databases and look up the nearest one.
But since you seem to be drawing from a book, I'd guess the author or printer simply created his own character that fits what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it more Odry Empire than OdryNsky?
PSS: Someone's already cracked it for you.
Check out that comment with
Politicians have no idea what will be the 'them' of our Presidency.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is funny.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, but some basic knowledge of English is not enough, that is a matter of lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with English it is quite interesting, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't get the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for three years, and I'm totally fine.
How many times do I come home from work at 10:00 p.m. and never have a problem?
The fact that he's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's never been there in his life.
Yeah, probably most of the Romani population of Brno live there, but all they do is interfere on the sidewalk and park where they don't have :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb the street in the evening.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap apartment with good access to the center, I'd go for it.
Many apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovacek (78) without Dáda and Gelem's mistress as a stake in the fence!
Who's he gonna spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the Advent wreath lit their first candle, Felix Slovacek didn't.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw the dady wreath and I'm sure Lucie has some too, said to Lightning saxophonist, who so confirmed the words of Patras that he often visits her.
She visits, but she doesn't live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after he left.
Slovak still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We met recently with Annie, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slovácek and Lucie Gelem: AGAIN!
Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelem: AGAIN!
But we talked all the time, so we didn't make it to Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I keep buying gifts, and I'm sure I'll buy something for Dáda and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the christening of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to hang out with, claims Slovacek, who was happy to meet his wife Ludek Saturday Adriana or singer Kamila Nyvlta.
And he made it very clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is strategic enough that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to take over this territory.
And I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know any other file that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are short, and they can't afford it, so the firemen themselves, and nowhere else is that high a percentage of medically trained people at that level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend only Ostrava goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, it has been begging for new toys for long enough.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic has been going through the worst drought in years.
According to scientists, the waters have decreased in mountain and sub-mountain areas, with less rainfall being recorded in places where there has been no shortage of moisture.
Climate change is the cause of drought in much of Central Europe.
But the impact is also enhanced by the way we manage the soil.
What is there to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's gonna be that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what hockey is, and the tactic (what I tried at Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total bust.
And whether you're the "bear Russia" or "lama China" hockey team, losing by two goals, even if you don't have to win at all costs, it's different than when it's tied.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators who poke, what judges notice, whether male or female hockey, it's all weird, but it's probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the other way around, it's like always, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "scent lost" vs. "We won".
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
A total of 34 451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 1967 for 100 000, 871 for 100 000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new diseases have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It's the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain faces an "inevitable" large wave of contagion caused by Omicron, said on Sunday television, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the British Health Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to grow.
So far, no one has died of omicron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labour Chief Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson's government defended that the quiz took place "virtually", over the computer.
However, it was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is increasing to remove Johnson from prime ministership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, the Johnson Ministers organized numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial television for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won by a vast majority in general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from his post as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary awaits elections in the spring that can end Viktor Orbán's 12-year government.
It will be an election of European importance.
How much do you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be free, because they weren't even the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz side controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to profit from it, and makes other smaller or bigger tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesza to bind voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they're not gonna be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
It used to be, not if Fidesz wins, but how much and if he has a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
That's a big habit for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play harder to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér has leaked to independent media, where he tells secret service chiefs that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are those the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
Everything starts with the tongue.
I've been beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has long, but then he explodes extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and angry as a little girl, to the point that I was lying on the ground in a cramp and it was all blue, so they took me under the shower twice to calm down.
Sometimes they gave me education, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things with violence now, as a child, I've been fighting quite a bit, now I'm hitting something for discharge, and as a younger parent, I've been slapping my hand like that (so I don't get too much in the face), so I never get anything extreme, but I always get the urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosive, but I'm sure the upbringing has a part to it.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose patience with my kids, too, and deal with it the same way.
I think hitting kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially when it wasn't "educational" anymore, but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just fucks something up, it's probably not possible not to fuck their kids up a little bit, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
The laws are to be clear and unambiguous.
I'd call cunts the ones that make up the law in that quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're worried about a blackout?
Can you really expect people to want and buy a product and you'll have something to pay the mortgage for?

Where will Slovakia move the process with the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the trial of four defendants for the murders of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connection to the top Slovak politics and justice.
How crucial a turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
It's the press's fault for this.
How is it possible that this petition had more media attention than the counterpetition of the deans of all medical schools that came out a day or two later?
No, they went crazy, and the company took the fall.

The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be reworked.
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš's government is at an end and there is still no law to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of a deep storage of high radioactive waste.
The Legislative Council of the Government has interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government after the long-term delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against the deep repository, but also with the Association of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-administratives expect a greater strengthening of their options in decision-making on the repository, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and required by the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to redefine the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, who has the Platform at his disposal, criticises municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the choice of the site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Management of Storages to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned prior to the initiation of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a substantive intention almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of municipalities practically mere statics in the authorisation procedures.
The design lacks system compensation settings for municipalities for the whole process of searching and selecting the location for storage, its authorisation and operation.
According to today's legal norms, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit their comments or appeal, but the Office or the Minister in whose interest it is to issue an authorisation shall decide.
Any action shall not have suspensory effect on the performance of research or construction work.
The codecision of self-government that the Platform asks for is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those where they have already advanced in storage authorisation, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, moreover, another failure of the state administration, which hires external law offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., concluded by SÚRAO and following contracts with Jan Zemánek.
According to the contract register, the total amount for these works is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, Vice-Mayor of Cejle from Hrádek and spokesperson of the Platform against the Deep Sea Storage said: After the Ministers of Industry, who settled the position of self-government against the state authorities in search of the deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste only pushed on their successors, we expect a stronger turn from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental building similarly, as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The deep-sea storage platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not only be limited to deep-sea storage.
The Platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of the site for possible storage should be conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced to lose weight fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although for years he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle, the doctors eventually frightened him.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He bragged about his new character in Los Angeles during the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the Roseanne sitcom is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body caused the crackling of furniture.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in an interview for AARP in 2018.
I wanted to do it slow this time.
Move, practice.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit in a place anymore, he said for ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If there's a text on the platform that's expecting readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text and a college text, I'd probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There's more than one kind of boss for everything.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses, right, and so is "boss" something like a master / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, Hidden boss), who are not at all needed to beat the game or level has been completed, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player does not go straight with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that at all?
Well, then there's the mini bosses.
It is simply not possible to translate the boss in one way or another, Czech and other languages do not solve it (it is interesting only in Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game generally significant, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for missing Petra from London.
Czech police also participated.
The missing Petra Srnc has been wanted by the British police since December 3rd.
Czech police also participated in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Hungary has been searching since December 7th.
He's also helping the British police through Interpol.
Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow memo for her.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
"We share information about the case," she added.
A BOLO on Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse at one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such disappearance is very unusual for her.
Mrs Harriet Harman was involved in the search for Petra.
She's involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, the British police have already apprehended one suspect.
But it is not clear who he is and what he had to do with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While the data in October pointed to a slight decline in offensive campaigns, last month, with the approaching end of the year, the attacks increased significantly.
We've seen a major campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail should attract the user’s attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment in the name had the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the correction receipt for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login data, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the coming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
Spyware Formbook remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically focus on the Czech Republic and security specialists captured campaigns with global reach in November.
Compared to October's data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still stands behind almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook contained the most frequently an annex to the .exe extension, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
The annex in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Significant decline and dampening of activity are recorded by security analysts in the programme Fareit, which was worth 1.6 percent of the attacks and in the Czech Republic has had no major offensive campaign for the past few months.
The brainy demo today that doesn't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade of Prague was bigger than the media said.
Based on the footage of the waterfront parade and my experience as a protestor, I'm not afraid of an estimate of about 10,000 people.
The people in the parade filled the waterfront and the bridge and opposite waterfront communication.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by are spontaneously added to the parade of some 4,000 demonstrators.
I'm saying something new is being born here, writes Radek Wet.
That the constant dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led them to find common ground.
Only antivaxers themselves, anti-guilty men and associates would not be able to fill or pay for a parade this big.
The actions of the "Dead Dog" association have an increasing popularity, reminds me of a million moments for democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement this dissatisfaction would be, depending not only on the money supply, but also on whether a three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not become a square or more batch.
It certainly won't be the leftist or the center, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The geniuses of scientists that humanity is rightly proud of.
The end of the heel, Bulgaria has a new prime minister proclaiming change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev commissioned Kirilov Petkov's new government from the anti-corruption movement.We continue the change that won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition that should take office in a few days.
The country’s political crisis has lasted since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the winning parties declaring the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not agree, so there were two more early elections.
What do cats do when no one's watching?
The "secret" shot is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, concerns grew about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, after which London police have been searching for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, the current employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived calls for information about a child hospital worker.
"The disappearance of Petra is nothing like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor, of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, around 19:45 and headed home to Camberwell.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her coworkers on December 3rd.
According to British media, she was a nurse's assistant at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to Guy's and St Thomas' hospital.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical establishments said in the tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help find her to contact the police," continued the message.
Šumper's amateur painter of children's rooms Zdeněk Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councilwoman) reported anonymously that he was violating copyright with his paintings.
The court, however, acknowledged that Krteček's paintings in the Šuperian rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a green moon hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was a death.
The Magistrate referred complaints about the ŘSD, which the road belongs to, and because it said it did not respond, the hole was still green.
Finally, the authorities cleared up their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the HSD "started to deal intensively with the situation".
