Members of the Welsh Assembly fear that they will “look like Muppets ”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are appalled by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal are plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could be mocked.
A member of the Labourist Party said that his group is concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said that his group was approaching a change in the name “with an open mind,” but he noted that MWP was close to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced in the same way as the letter "u" in Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now preparing legislation for the introduction of name changes, said: “The final decision on what the members of the Welsh Assembly will, of course, be on the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public meeting on proposals, where broad support was given to the option of calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of members of the assembly, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the most support in the public debate.
The members of the Assembly are clearly proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can bring concern to President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a draft legislation within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members and a proposal for a system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the question of their title in the context of the discussion of the new legislation.
The Macedonians will vote to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether the name of their country will change to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
People-to-people vote should resolve decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of a northern neighbour represents a claim to Greek territory and repeatedly protested against applications for membership of a country in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes plebiscite about changing the name, said he would not abide by the vote.
But referendum advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will shut up because the churches in Harlem are struggling to survive.
"The old people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner," Adams says.
"Today there is neither."
He thinks bar disappearances are understandable.
"People meet in a different way today," he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go."
With regard to churches, he fears that the money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started.”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such types of people who will not be much help to the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and so soon the day will come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who will move into the apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation whose religious activities were held nearby.
St. Martin took over the black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote black people.
The fire had severely damaged the building in 1939, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered the chimes.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the chimes of the poor.
The expert who played the chimes in July called it otherwise: the "cultural treasure" and the "unreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first wind chime in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a bigger wind chime in a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says he wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, a complicated story of architects and builders took place at St. Martin's, some of which were called by the lay representatives of the church, others were called by the episcopal diocese.
In July, the Council of Elders – the head of the parish, consisting of lay officials – sent a letter to the diocese in which he expressed concern that the diocese would “try to pass the costs” to the council of elders, although it did not participate in the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency from the diocese.
A shark wounded a 13 - year - old boy in California diving for lobsters
According to official report, a shark attacked and injured a 13 - year - old boy who was diving for lobsters in California on the day of the lobster season.
The attack took place shortly before 7am near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour when he heard the boy cry for help, and then he paddled to him with the whole group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that the call first considered the joy of a lobster catch, but then “he realized that he was screaming ‘ Bite me!
He bit me!""
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that “he had torn the entire area of the collarbone. ”
“I shouted for everyone to go out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” adds Hammel.
The boy was delivered in critical condition by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles at the press conference said the shark was spotted in this area weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities for investigation and security have closed for 48 hours access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's wants to stand up to Boots, Superdrog and Debenhams chains with cosmetic alleys in the style of a department store where special sales girls will be available.
As a result of the strong entry into the UK cosmetics market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion sales and domestic needs are falling, the cosmetics lanes will be tested in 11 stores across the country.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to supermarkets’ efforts to find use for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwaves, and home supplies.
Sainsbury's reports that it will double the range of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and first mention brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also be given to existing range from brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees thanks to branded locations similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket also reintroduces its range of make-up Boutique, so most products will be vegan, which young customers increasingly require.
In addition, two Saintsbury’s stores will test the franchise of the Fragrance Shop perfume retailer. The first such shop was opened last week in Croydon, south of London and another one will be created this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping on the Internet and moving towards buying small amounts of food everyday in local shops means that supermarkets must try harder to attract people.
The CEO of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that stores will look more and more like department stores because a chain of supermarkets are trying to better offer services and non-food products to combat discount dealers like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of Argos stores and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are chains that he bought two years ago, making food sales more profitable and making acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to redecorate the department with cosmetic and pharmaceutical assortment ended infamously.
At the beginning of the millennium Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of drug sales revenue in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s three years ago sold its 281 pharmacies for £125 million to Celesio, which owns a chain of lloyds pharmacies.
Lloyds has a plan to play his part by adding to four stores an extended range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
The business director of Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the look and style of the cosmetic aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all needs and tempting environments and convenient location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is "angry" after Holly Willoughby resigned her contract for £11 million.
The star of Dragons Day Peter Jones is "angry" after television host Holly Willoughby resigned from a $11 million contract with his lifestyle brand so she can focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothing brand and Truly accessories.
This couple's business was compared to Goop's brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
Thirty-seven-year-old host of the show announced that she was on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby enraged Dragons Day star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones “roasted” when the TV star, at a tense Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of new contracts – worth up to £1.5 million – would no longer be able to devote enough time to their label of home clothes and accessories to Truly.
The company was compared to Goop by actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of moderator Willoughby at an estimated value of £11 million.
When 37 - year - old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly’s brand, Jones set off from Britain to one of his summer residences.
An unnamed source states: “Truly’s brand was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would secure her for decades to come.
Her decision to leave was completely shocking to all those involved.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was going on, the launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of goods ready for sale at Marlow Central."
Experts believe that the departure of the moderator of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to a fat investment in pillows and candles to clothing and home clothing and a possible further delay in branding.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and in March she joined as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become an M&S ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin when hosting I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business."
Difficult behavior "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from journalists as a comment that some consider “unworthy president” and for the positive way he speaks of North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his mocking "voting" voice.
"I didn't give up on anything."
He noted that after their first meeting in Singapore in June Trump appreciated it as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea, Kim was interested in the next meeting.
But the nuclear-weapons negotiation is deadlocked.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, a prominent North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “corresponding response” from the US on its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, the US continues with sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
According to him, his efforts to improve relations with Kim resulted in positive results – ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside of this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of us.
A tsunami wave and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
In the event of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs have learned that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have been driven out of their homes, there has been no national disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it very clear that they did not require international assistance, so it is a bit difficult," she says.
The Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work here.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutupo, said that Indonesian workers are evaluating the situation in Paul to see if it will be possible for international organisations to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the earth is still woefully unprepared for the wrath of Mother Nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not common on other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of sirens in Paul’s warning against tsunamis likely contributed to the loss of human lives, even when a warning was issued.
Even in the best time travel among many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that docked in Lombok and helped earthquake victims is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days for it to reach the site of the new calamity.
Improving poor Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and the President spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
Next year, he will seek re-election, but his government is plagued by financial outages.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members adopt a more conservative form of faith.
Street struggles between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than thousands of people, and tens of thousands have driven people out of their homes.
Look: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a balancing goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored at 89 minutes on Saturday in London’s Stamford Bridge, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 yards outside Chelsea's gate when his team lost 1-0.
He threw the ball on his left and fired at a remote stick.
The bullet flew high and headed to the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually jumped over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I wanted to buy as much time as possible.” told Sturridge to the LiverpoolFC.com server.
"I saw Kante coming towards me, so I didn't think about it too much, and he fired at one touch."
Chelsea at halftime led 1-0 after the goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent his passport back to Mateo Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the field and sprinted halfway across Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball.
Then he sent the ball down the beautiful aisle to Hazard in the lime.
He escaped defense and ended up with a left to a remote pole next to Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 15 o'clock, Liverpool will compete with the local team in the Champions League at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will be playing in London on Thursday at 3:00 with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian Disaster Authority stated on Sunday morning, the number of earthquakes and tsunamis had risen to 832.
The 7.5 degree earthquake struck on Friday, sparked waves of up to 6 meters high and imprisoned many people in the ruins of collapsed buildings, said Sutopo Purwo Nugro's spokesman at a press conference.
The city of Paul, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old male suspected of stabbing a woman.
A female body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A woman 44 years of age with stab wounds was found at 7.55 p.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called on people in the neighborhood who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: “The investigation is only in the beginning, but I would like to appeal to all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras may have recorded something to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation,"
Police spokesperson confirmed that a dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the scene who think they know a woman to ask where she was found this morning.
Police say there's an investigation going on, and now they're informing the victims' relatives.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
The residents have now learned that it will take several hours for them to return home.
One person was told by a police officer that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
He keeps saying, "That's terrible."
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans behind the tape, and another was waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers in the closed area who monitor the house.
Anyone who has any information can send a message to @MerPolCC, call Line 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and give a code 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament has recently become a hit because of an argument about "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be a well-deserved punishment for his fanatical Puritan followers in the Taliban style destroying a lot of English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolish" and "trying to rewrite history."
The chairman of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, notes: “In the current discussion on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of Westminster Palace was inevitable to become one of the targets.
Cromwell did not order or perform iconoclasm in English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell, authored by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is proof of the 19th century's view and part of the history of the character that many think still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although a little less today than at the end of the 19th century, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of constant historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure that represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig tore up Chinese farmers
According to local media, the market in Southeast China has been attacked and killed by a pig farmer.
As the South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man with only the last name “Yuan”, was found dead with a severed artery in a pool of blood near a pigsty on the market in Liu-pchan-shui in the province of Kuizhou.
The pig breeder is preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs in the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Si-ning, China, Qinghai Province.
Reportedly, he arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the next province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next pigsty was open.
According to him, there was a big pig in the pigsty with a mouth full of blood.
According to the forensics, it was confirmed that a 250-pound pig tore the farmers apart.
"The cousin's legs were all bloody and torn," Guiyang Evening News quotes a cousin named "Wu".
The security footage shows Yuan coming to the market Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousins.
The manager of the marketplace told the Evening News daily that the pig was closed so no one else would think of it when the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Market officials are allegedly negotiating with Yuan's family to compensate him for his death.
Pig attacks on humans are rare, but they have already taken place in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and critically injured a man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig pushed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and drove him back to the farmer’s wife.
After eating his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoby told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a "starter".
“They’re just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them enough respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains will bring heavy rain to the Southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecasting to weaken and move above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the next few days, it will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and to the southwest of the United States.
At 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, and was 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low pressure trail is forming and moving eastward to the west coast of the US. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, she will take the form of a tropical storm and start pushing tropical moisture northwards into the southwest part of the US.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain on Monday.
Tropical humidity, as it approaches the low pressure furrow in the following days, will cause heavy rains in the southwest of the US.
Precipitation between 25 and 100 mm locally causes dangerous floods, debris streams and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall to occur between 50 and 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the south-west of the US, especially over most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of rain is expected.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, floods may occur under rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Given the dangers of tropical rainfall, it would be very unreasonable to walk into the desert.
Strong rain can cause canyons to become raging rivers, and storms bring local shock winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure wake will bring heavy local rainfall on some parts of the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation over 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller currents of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, unique tropical showers begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evenings and Tuesdays, the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Horns and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the US, because the Arctic will begin to cool, but it will still be quite warm in the tropical zone.
This sometimes leads to rapid temperature changes at short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the US on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few today, they will try again to expand the continual summer heat.
In most areas in the middle and east of the US, a warm start is expected to start in October with temperatures of around 27 °C from the southern plains to parts of the northeast of the US.
New York City could be 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above average temperatures in the east of the US in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interview was followed by over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday's captivating testimony of the candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, and the announcers interrupted routine programs with news of a sudden Friday's twist: the deal that Senator Jeff Flake brokered for Arizona, about the FBI conducting a one-week investigation into the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate's court committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was touching her drunk at a high school party and trying to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in his heated statement that he was 100% sure it hadn't happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen were watching the event.
The company counted average ratings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for other stations that broadcast statements such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble accounting people who look at offices.
For comparison, it is a similar number of viewers who watch football matches in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest ratings of all stations when, according to Nielsen, an average of 5.69 million spectators watched him throughout the day’s hearing.
The second was ABC station with 3.26 million spectators.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2,52 million viewers.
Interest remained after the end of the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After this moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras picked up on Friday morning shouting protestors at him when he was going to take the elevator to a court committee meeting.
CNN was streaming live as he stood with his eyes down for a few minutes and let himself be called names.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are helpless. ”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he added that he'd say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later broadcast live when the court committee was to vote for Kavanaugh's nomination to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate by next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without an investigation, Republicans wouldn't have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "politics" on Brexit.
In an interview for the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "politics" over Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was close with the Prime Minister on the front page, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect their customs duties against each other was “absolutely senseless.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of the death of an LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in a case of the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and arrested on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the Sims police, he lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the WABF channel under CBS, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde after being questioned by the police.
According to the attorney, bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Refugee Police Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of LSU Joe Alleva thanked local police for “the drive and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
Last season, the average was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that Wayde's death had "shaked" the team and "shocked" him.
"This is what you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spews ashes in Mexico City
The ashes coming from the Popcatatepetle volcano hit the southern district of the Mexican capital.
The National disaster prevention centre on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after volcano activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a series of thunderstorms and tremors.
On social networks, images of car windshields covered with a thin layer of ash appeared in some areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in volcano activity, located 72 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of the capital city. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a power of 7.1 degrees.
Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, the police met the Catalan separatists.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protesters for independence met with the police and thousands of people participated in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence, which divided Catalonia.
Orderly officers blocked a group of masked separatists throwing eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists.
Later, there were skirmishes that police had to use batons to calm down.
In a matter of hours, groups supporting independence sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in the face of the protesters of the Union who called "Live Spain".
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured during the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate it, tensions in a region seeking independence remain high.
Voters voted largely for independence, but participation in elections was low because opponents of secession boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police in violent clashes throughout the region tried to end the vote in the polls.
Groups supporting independence stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
The sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who and his wife participated in a separatist protest, said he no longer hoped for independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we had some of the best moments.
My parents wept with joy that they could vote, but now we are at an impasse," he said.
Despite the important, albeit close victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence-encouraging parties had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their best-known leaders either went into exile themselves or wait in custody for their contribution to the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old fitter Joan Puig recorded a protest to support the police on his phone and said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tenser," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting in prison for trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will be running for the European Parliament next year.
"The candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and repression that we are witnessing by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after the car hit the house
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were imprisoned after driving repeatedly into a Londonderry house.
The event happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, maybe someone fired a crossbow at the car.
Meng's shot secured Livingston's victory 1-0 over the Rangers
Dolly Mengy's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who advanced from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and only awarded Steven Gerrard a second defeat of 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit turned out to be crucial when Gary Holt's team made it to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team doesn't have a victory in the Premiership League on the guest field yet, and next Sunday, the first Hearts will stand up for losing eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has expanded a number of undefeated games in the division to six games, so the head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miler last month, hasn't experienced defeat yet.
Livingston didn't take a chance against the bland guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal, because his straightness caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed at the gate, then Alan Lithgow just missed Craig Halkett's head in front of the goal.
All the landlords had to do was watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could torment the guests with standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against the Rangers was ordered a free kick and Livingston created a loophole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent out Menga, which ball in the middle of the penalty zone flowed and scored.
At this stage the Rangers dominated in possession of the ball, but the home defense for them was impenetrable and goaltender Liam Kelly usually did not have much work.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers Allan McGregor's legs, and Lithgow missed another standard Livingstone situation.
Centres were constantly flying into Livingstone’s fine territory, which players kept cleaning, and two penalty kicks came to nothing – after Halkett’s attack on Glenn Middleton’s understudy and others.
Livingstone’s “Financial” – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and continue to overcome expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and team has hardly changed since returning to the top, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has stirred up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was tremendous, leading a well-arranged defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert all the time.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they're no longer up to these standards.
Their endgame was weak – only once penetrated the home side – and it should be a wake-up call for the Rangers because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan had a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), the sky was blue and everyone smiled.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to correct relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting outside the mosque, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people were also heard – many of them Kurds – protesters against Erdogan, who condemned his policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposing protests reflect the controversy of a visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
Deptford Accident: A cyclist died after a car collision
A cyclist died in London after a car crash.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street with busy Evelyn Street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and an ambulance arrived soon, but the man was dead on the spot.
The death occurred only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the site of Saturday’s tragedy in an accident on Childers Street, when the driver fled the scene.
Metropolitan Police said that police are now trying to identify the men and inform their relatives.
The road is closed, buses are on alternate routes and motorists are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in the riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured during a riot in a high security male prison.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and still last.
To cope with riots involving eight prisoners in the same wing, special guards from the Tornado team were called.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on site.
A prison - service spokesman said: “In order to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison workers were deployed.
Six staff members have been treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend longer time behind bars."
There are over 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was announced that the warden ended up in the hospital after the prisoner was attacked.
And last October, riot squads were called into prison for serious riots in which the staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the floods of Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (areas where there is drought can benefit)
It is not usual for a tropical low-pressure wake to hit Arizona, but this is probably what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and risks the floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning on Mondays and Tuesdays from West Arizona for South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix, Twitter, reported that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm status or pressure below within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Center for Hurricanes predict rainfalls of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona with up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Panes, it is likely to fall from 25 to 50 mm, with local aggregates of up to 100 mm.
For those who are not threatened by floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, because drought has struck the area.
Floods are a very serious thing, but these rainfalls may also help, because the Southwest of the US has just hit drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, the server weather.com reports that more than 40% of Arizona experience at least “extreme drought”, which is the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa's journey will lead first to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still on the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning it will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and thus loses its strength.
They're expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or night like a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, the rainfall will be strong, which poses a great risk of flooding.
"In the area from Baja California to northwest Sonora, a total rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected, and can occur up to 250 mm," reports weather.com.
Rosa will then travel as a tropical storm across Mexico north and arrive on Tuesday morning at the Arizona border, then pass through Arizona and enter South Utah late on Tuesday night.
"The main risk of Rosa or her remains is expected to be very severe collisions in Baja California, northwest Sonora and desert southwest of the USA," the National Center for Hurricanes reports.
These rains are expected to cause deadly floods and debris streams in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old male were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area at Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As reported by the police in Avon and Somerset, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
Cops are looking for witnesses who might have a record of what happened on their cell phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "experienced wickedness and rage" Democratic Party
"The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the unscrupulous and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "experienced wickedness and rage" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, where he decidedly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she was sexually assaulted a few decades ago when teenagers were teenagers.
At the hearing on her charge, Ford testified.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day “the Americans witnessed Kavanaugh’s greatness and quality and courage.”
He said to his supporters from West Virginia that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer with excellent public service in his accounts.”
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it was for Republicans to participate in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats opted for "resistance and obstruction."
A Republican Party Advisor told CNN Station that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate floor is expected on Friday at the latest.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims is still growing.
The authorities announced on Saturday that after an extensive earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of whom were swept away by huge waves that flooded the beaches.
Hundreds of people met on the beach in Palu on Friday. At dusk, however, the coast hit up to six meters [6 m] waves that killed many people and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people continued their activities on the beaches and did not run away immediately, so they fell to the waves as a victim," said the spokesman of the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugro at the briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave didn't go alone, it took cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami wave spread on the open sea at 800 km/h.
He said that some people fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pal.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster relief agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed by bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The consequences shook the coastal city even on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by Friday’s strong shocks was about 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could increase the tsunami wave even further.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found wedged under the ruins of collapsed buildings, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the amount of casualties and damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is close to the earthquake epicenter.
According to him, the communication was "totally crippled without any information" from Donggala.
In his statement, the Red Cross stated that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers are heading to the affected sites.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," it says.
The Agency received considerable criticism on Saturday because it did not inform that a tsunami wave hit Palu, even though the authorities said that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
On amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building screaming desperately alerting people on the street from the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the coast will hit the water wall, which will carry buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the alert immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a major power outage that disrupted communications around Pal, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army began to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for transport assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was supposed to visit the Palo evacuation center on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in the city of Paul, where employees were hiding in the shelters of the celts built in the yard of the office building, they saw images of destruction, says Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups began their sad disaster relief activities, some complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies, and personnel from abroad can only begin to flow to the site of calamity when a national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," says the spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, Aulia Arriani.
"Once the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can start international aid, but it is not yet."
When Paul’s second night came after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing, they kept hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that lighten the bleak stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the paramedics freed a woman who was trapped under the wreckage next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon described how in the lessons that followed after the paragliding community learned about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages through WhatsApp to contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, instead of a pair of blue checkers, ended with a gray mark.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling up the ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves estranged $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning in addition to an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the car driver was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to put more money into it.
When he did that, another man "runs out from behind Brink's employee" and steals a bag of money to be put in an ATM.
Witnesses reportedly saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
If you have any information on the identity of the suspects, please report to Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West is changing his name – to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: “A place formally known as Kanye West. ”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time now, and he used the pseudonym as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
Change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album Yandhi.
The show will be replaced by Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "feeling reasons", as the programme creator said.
West had previously said that the word for him, in addition to shortening the current professional name, has a religious significance.
"In my opinion, "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, which means "you," West let himself be heard at the beginning of this year when he spoke about his album with Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
It has changed from Kanya, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
Many other famous rappers changed their name.
Sean Combs was known at different times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
Former West's associate, JAY-Z, also alternately wrote his name with and without the link and with large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the approaching 50th anniversary of the bloody intervention against students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlátelolco Plaza that “he would never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when left-wing student movements were spreading throughout Latin America, soldiers on October 2, 1968, began shooting people at peaceful demonstrations in the square and killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those who are studying and by opening other free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education drag young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
According to the investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published announcements about AI, although the US as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced a plan last year, according to which it wants to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are much further away than the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC that doubling funding could double the chance that the next big discovery in the AI area would be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book “Superpower AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980’s, he worked on the AI system that surpassed the best American player in Othello, and later he was the head of Microsoft research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated the previous technology competitions of the US government, such as the Robotic Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants.
"Academic tops are not taken away by China, but by corporations," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been employing the best university experts in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help to improve efforts in the AI area.
"I think that the holders of a doctorate in AI should be offered green cards automatically," he says.
The Council of State of China issued the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to that of the National Science Council and other government organizations giving money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners in the industry and academic environment, and the White House announced the creation of the Selection Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF Foundation is concerned, it now invests more than USD 100 million a year in AI research.
But US legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", which would resolve a several decades-old dispute with Greece, blocking applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour is entitled to its territory and therefore vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether at least 50 percent of voters would come forward to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you up for NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of former Yugoslavia. to join organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the roof of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the result of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no problems were reported within 13 hours.
However, the vote was only 16 percent compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters eventually cast their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voters from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the Macedonian referendum on a change of name that would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and pulls out chairs in front of tents built by people who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads held high, not the servants' door," Kavadarkov says.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, the result of "yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, a referendum could take place between 30 and 43 percent of voters – less than the required turnout.
In another survey organized by the Macedonian station Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its onset last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City came for a goal through the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defenses on Saturday to secure Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguer's presentation, his goal looked ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
It all started with a pass that Argentina's attacker got in the middle of the field.
He sprinted between three Brighton defenders and got into open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the edge of Brighton's fine territory, he bypassed one defender and overcame several others.
Next pass to the left, he found Sterling.
The English attacker nailed the ball back to Aguer in the penalty zone, who, with his right hand, beat the goaltender Brighton Mathew Ryan with a bullet to the right side of the net.
"Aguero has leg problems," the city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky he scored in that moment."
The initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League game was arranged by Sterling.
This goal went down in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to the remote pole.
Attacker Sky Blues dropped the ball into the net just before he slipped off the field.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there were not many reasons to re-emerge.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the place of a pitcher in a game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday – only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West by one match over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have the chance of a playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night by winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, we can at least play games, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the other team will play with the most effort I will experience this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in it?"
Nationals haven't announced who's starting on Sunday yet, but they say they're inclined to pitch Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer it would be the 34th start. On Thursday he would train and pitch on Sunday, when he usually has the day off.
The right-handed pitcher of Washington has 18-7 statistics this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump got off at a meeting in West Virginia
The President indirectly commented on the situation surrounding his candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republicans taking part in the mid-term elections.
“In November everything we have done will be at stake.
We have five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones - I don't run, but we're still on the move and I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power with whatever means necessary, you see the wickedness, the repulsiveness.
They don't care who gets hurt, who they have to roll over to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not gonna give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats opted for "resistance and obstruction".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, saying, "the Democrats are angry and evil and repulsive and lying."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Commission, the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to the loud mooing of the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, what?
No, uh no, wait -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse stream of opinion.
He is intolerant of those who express their views
When Momento activists in my local party voted in favour of my admonition, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MEPs to whom they have told that they are not welcome – because they have expressed their sincere opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically similar matters on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Friday's meeting of the Labour Party at Nottingham East said that "we want the meetings to be open and productive."
Most of the eight years I was a local member of the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today do not take place, and the promise of a more "loving, kinder" policy has long since been forgotten if it has ever been started.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is assessed as to whether they are acceptable to the Party’s leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues, who I had previously thought had similar political views, suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and hold positions with which I could otherwise not agree – whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't matter what I say – then there is a tirade of swearing on social networks, calling for my appeal, condemning Wednesday policy and telling me that I should not be on the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me are usually political.
I have respect for professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face a burst of sexist or racist insults every day, but will never budge.
One aspect of this era of politics, from which I am most disappointed, is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the diverse current of opinion, and with every proposal to censure or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I've been told many times to stay away, not to answer so much, and then "I'll be fine."
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student of the school, provoked by the negligence of Margaret Thatcher's government, who literally let my general school class fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most – whether as local councillor or minister of government.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised at my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only say that when the country is breaking through to Brexit, which will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not for the Moment in Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of appeal or pragmatism will deter me from acting on what I think is the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr ascends to the top
Two late fives have distorted the final result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
Now they're at the forefront of the tables, the only undefeated.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of the chances that helped the domestics to win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"In our fights we passed great tests and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All the honor of Ayra, they took a better chance than we do. ”
Grant Anderson's five at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for the Scottish representative Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numbers and Jason Baggot won the unaltered five.
Climo raised Ayr's lead by penalty and then scored and turned solo at exactly halftime, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and five Patrick Anderson, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the playground on the stretcher, and when the game started again, Ayr jumped again thanks to the five Stafford McDowall he turned Climo.
Acting captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and Melrose again used the extra player thanks to the unaltered five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
The landlords returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking Clim without the ball, MacPherson from the penalty lineup laid the ball behind the advancing maul Ayru.
Climo turned, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing to pick up the fifth five landlords.
Star Still Game launches a new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of Still Game Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality business and has been found to have been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-six-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show that he writes and plays along with Greg Hemphill's longtime comedy partner.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last series of the series, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the extract from the official register, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the report, but the source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to participate in a "prosperous business in restaurants" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol outside the naval headquarters of La Paz, which is decorated with rigging.
Above public buildings is a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the motto: “The sea is rightfully ours.
It's our duty to get it."
Throughout inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coast that the country lost in favor of Chile in the bloody war for resources in the 19th century – as is the desire to re-trave the Pacific Ocean.
These desires may be the greatest in decades, because Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision that should fall on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has energy, the spirit of unity and calm and, of course, expects a positive outcome," says the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of MSD on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after many decades of interrupted talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate that Bolivia will provide sovereign access to the sea.
The charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia Evo Morales – who has a controversial battle ahead of him for re-election next year – is also very interested in Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely for the court to rule in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, not much would change.
This UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to anyone and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that MSD’s decision comes only six months after the latest arguments have been put forward shows that the case was “not complicated”, as Paz Zárate says, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, they haven't only supported Bolivia, but maybe they've slowed it down.
"The current Bolivian government seized the question of access to the sea," says Zárate.
He adds that Morales' offensive rhetoric weakened all remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will act again one day, but this will make it extremely difficult to have discussions.
Both countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia a “exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance “to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual advantages,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused to use the question of the sea as a political crutch – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"Judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless the US can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to make promises made to the summit of leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be rebooting nuclear diplomacy, which is deadlocked, for more than three months for the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a “flame of hope” that ongoing sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about consenting to the declaration unless Pyongyang takes significant steps to disarm first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
Of course, there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris shows show that your fashion shops will soon arrive with the latest trend of giant headcovers
If you want to expand your hat collection or block the sun completely, your search is over.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a number of crazy giant head covers for their Spring/Summer 2019 collections at a fashion week show that captivated everyone.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their exciting creations to the piers.
The exhibition piece by Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge reminiscent of feathers that flooded model heads.
Other oversized accessories were embellished melons, witch hats, and even pineapples – but are not intended to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with great fashion – you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that giant hats could even reach fashion shops.
The oversized hats come after "La Bomba", a straw man with a half-metre wide cremation, which was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind this very impractical hat, which flooded social media, sent another huge creation to the catwalk – the straw beach bag, which is almost the same size as the swimsuit model that carries it.
A dark orange rafter bag lined with rafio fringes and equipped with a white leather handle on the Paris Week of Fashion was an exhibition piece of the La Riviera Spring/Summer 2019 collection by Jacquemus.
celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for the next summer – given that the designer has had such great success with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for excessively large accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have had a number of academic achievements and it continues in 2018 with other outstanding exam results. Individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other community activities only underline this.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is representing over 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, and is trying to provide their pupils and parents with the best possible level of service.
Independent schools are preparing their pupils for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually adapted school education plans, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes right to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes right into his heart."
It is an important observation that if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
The latest results of this year's exams show that languages are at the top of the tables, with independent schools having the highest success rate.
In total, 68 percent of pupils learning a foreign language achieved the best A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS Member Schools show that 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students reached the highest grade A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subjects chosen by pupils are in the study plans of independent and other schools as well as STEM subjects (sciences, technologies, technical fields and mathematics).
The survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of employers’ lack of language skills are due to the problems of job vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are a necessity in a globalised world.
Whatever career you choose, if you learn a second language, you will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person speaking more languages automatically gains an advantage over competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, namely 15%.
Therefore, it is important for today's children to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially those of emerging economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have several languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what awaits them in the future.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country in a global business environment, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity, and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will introduce himself in the Lakers jersey for the first time on Sunday in San Diego
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James joining the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time will soon be waiting.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in the Sunday opening game of the San Diego preseason against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes it's going to take.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably only play for a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
"I don't need preseason matches at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is opening a wave of campaigning in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
It's the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the suspension of the vote to confirm his candidate for a vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in the November elections.
What time does Trump's performance start tonight, and how can you track him online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 Eastern time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be watched online below via live YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about hearing the candidate for Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court this week, and he's been very tense about the allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, and it's expected that the Senate's confirmation vote will be postponed by a week before the FBI investigation.
But the main goal of this wave of meetings is to help the Republicans pick up the pace before the November elections.
According to Reuters, campaign organizers President Trumpa say that these five meetings next week aim to “encourage volunteers and supporters so that the Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives”.
"Control over the Senate is so important for his agenda that the President will go to as many states as possible during this busy season," said the spokesperson for Trump's campaign, who did not wish to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could come to the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling today's meeting and be watched by the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, in which he gained more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey who is lagging behind in the polls.
"For Morriseye, it is not a good sign that the President must come to help him in his surveys," says a political scientist from West Virginia University Simon Haeder, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed that it has the stomach to fight to keep its hopes up before Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, Saturday’s couples can be just what Ryder Cup needed.
A swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe it, and most of all at such competitions.
So where does the pendulum go now?
"They took six points and now it's four, so we take it that the pendulum is probably moving a little towards us," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, it leads by four points, and there are still twelve.
As Spieth says, Americans feel that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day long and each can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly when he went from batting to green, and he set an example.
Celebratory screams were even stronger in the continuation of his round when he mastered the key heel to win the whole game when he and Tomas were two holes behind.
His putt, who won them a game of 15 holes, met with a similar roar that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players left.
18 holes for leaving a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder cup.
The strange, but adorable couple from Europe are four out of four, and they can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who missed the hole on Saturday afternoon, but missed Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning again."
The course and way in which energy flows both towards the stormy audience and from it confirms that these are players destined for Sunday's victory, and that by sundown over Le Golf Native there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best both on a different hole at the same time.
But talk of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergio Garcíe, the hero of the morning game with four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The hole and two doubles on the front nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in the abyss from which they no longer climbed.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you.
The games of two pairs on two balls are so fascinating when you closely follow the interaction of people in pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give themselves, and the way strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the last day, but this game of two couples has also shown that the US team has a stomach for a fight that some, especially from the states, have doubted.
To the final day of Ryder Cup Europe leads with a score of 10-6 points
Europe gets a healthy advantage by the last day of Ryder Cup then from Saturday’s games pairs to two balls came out with a 10-6 head start over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly almost won twice over Tiger Woods, were determined to make four cuts at Le Golf National.
The European Party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games on two balls with an American side that failed in the 3-1 series.
The US showed more resistance in four, won two games, but couldn't get into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's party needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who after a sensational weekend have been nicknamed "Molliwood", are only the second pair to win four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating the Woods and Patrick Reed players in the game of two balls even then smoothly beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who stretched out two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in a two-ball game and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after playing two balls in the morning, went back to partner Henrik Stenson in the doubles game to 2-1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world ranking.
But Europe did not have it on this pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris won across the line.
Three-time prime winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas took two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and came back later to beat the pair Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a pair game, despite losing the two first holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a double game, although as the defending Furyk side only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, the Sunday counterattack seems to be behind them.
North Korea says that “no way” will be disarmed unilaterally and without trust
On Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister said that continued UN sanctions have deepened their mistrust of the United States, and in such circumstances, the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see a corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances it is not possible to disarm itself unilaterally."
While Ri repeated the famous North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to the “progressive” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization just because Pyongyang had been through it in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 when Kim undertook to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump pledged guarantees of security to North Korea.
North Korea is pursuing a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the calls to release severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US insists on “denuclearization first” and increases the pressure on sanctions to force its targets and even object to the “declaration of the end of the war”, said Ri.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem is, however, that continued sanctions increase our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which American leaders emphasized at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were to be denuclearized and not the US, denuclearized the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles in US territory was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN Trump, which threatened to “total destruction” of North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take action to disarm, but he said that much work still has to be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is completely denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, however, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that: “The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without ceasing until we are fully aware of the complete, final, verified denuclearisation.”
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to suppress the financing of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Pyongyang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly and Pompeo said that next month he would visit Pyongyang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and declared that progress had been made only to be declared by North Korea within a few hours that he had made “gangster demands”.
North Korea pledged to meet Moon this month to dismantle the missile site as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He stated that Kim had announced to him that the “corresponding measures” he hoped for were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and was heading towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course to teach them enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University forced all of its students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of macho studies all night long, when students do not sleep and encourage caffeine.
The academics found that students at the world’s most famous university are often clueless when it comes to the basics of self - care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and the female hospital, who he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, explains to students basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's medical services, said that the university decided to set up a course after finding that the students had been seriously ill during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of student dormitories, where students click on cups with coffee, curtains, sneakers and books on the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In another part, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "studying all night" still exists, he added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
Enough sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon” of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation switches the brain into a hunger mode, so that one is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology in California, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that one of his classes attended last year during her first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended that students consider setting the alarm for the time when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that may upset your circadian rhythm, leading to difficulty falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Goal sunk Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Menga's hit confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with defeating 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox tried to record its first victory from 4 to 1 February of the triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team only caused Gerrard’s second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from the leading leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers lineup seemed uninhibited and determined to settle.
While the Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston is climbing to third and right behind the Hibernian team, as opposed to one goal.
And there could be other Rangers problems after a bar referee Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side that swept past Ayr into the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up the Hearts point last week and would be happy to see his well-trained team suffocating their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have taken hold, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were only supposed to score two minutes after the start when Meng first let Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder buried his big shot.
Then he found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only have tried the rear position.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have a penalty for a quarter-hour lead when he and Steven Lawless collided, but ref Steven Thomson took the Colombian challenge off the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots at the target in the first half, but former goaltender Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassana Coulibala and the tame shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's 34-minute opener may have been against running the game, no one can deny they deserved it for all the hard work they've done.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Menga to an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had almost an immediate result when the wing collapsed into Morelosa, but impressive Kelly fought his way from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors into the game of exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkettt hit one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Understudy Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to punishment when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and it is still increasing... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger Counter was then also a permanent pop culture, as in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly improbable scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What on earth is this? ”
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms effluent by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: “Oh, yeah, now he's really cracking! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can see a protein that's common to many cancers and then rivet injected again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine, who teaches the immune system to detect dangerous cells, disappeared ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so they can “see” protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-injected into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “controls the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were removed from patients and “taught” them to focus on cancer cells, was already promoted in leukemia treatment.
Kanye West attended the pro-Trump sermon, in his maga hat, after his performance on the SNL.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was booed at Saturday Night Live after a confused performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, wearing a make America Great Again cap, he started spitting at the Democrats and repeating his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, “How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?”
If I were into racism, I wouldn't be in America any more," he said.
SNL started a show of parody with Matt Damon in a lead role in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's rape charges.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's theatrical speech footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West.
West also complained to the viewers that he was able to eat his head off behind the scenes.
“Behind the scenes, I was bullied.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
That's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place," said Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on his superman suit because that means you can't say what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments only earned the buzz of the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL looked offended, embarrassed, says Variety, and one person even said, "The whole studio has gone silent."
West was invited as a late replacement for Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing a song I Love dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest characters: THANK YOU FOR CONSTRUCTING DAVA."
But the guest talk show Karen Hunter tweeted that West “was just who he was, and that's absolutely amazing. ”
“But I DON’T WANT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’), which I believe represents and sends to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us," she said.
Before the performance rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly named Snoop Lion and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant should stand trial in Belfast on Monday.
The charges filed will be reviewed by the State's Attorney's Office.
The game Thrones star Kit Harington has embarked on a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
However, the actor, 31 years old, stepped out of the macho hero stereotype and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be tough to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believed that "something is wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the era #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his Star of the Thrones of Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was “very strong” on this issue.
"At this moment I personally feel, quite strongly - what happened so bad with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach teenage men about the problem we are seeing here now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic malehood due to its very male characters.
He went on to say: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do guys learn on TV, on the streets, they make them feel like they need every man to have a side like that?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change that?
Because a young man must have changed for the worse.
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel Game of Thrones after the completion of the series, because he had had had enough "fights and horses".
From November, Kit will be playing in the restored Right West of Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose for the best that came out of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the set, so he gave me my future family and my whole subsequent life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this fantasy show award-winning Emmy.
A couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family house in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official numbers, over 820,000 people are affected by this virus.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, reported by Chinese medical professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China rose by 100,000 people year on year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
In view of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from the lack of sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies letting the staff escape the GOP Senators' data, lashing out the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, American MP Maxine Waters condemned the claim that a member of her staff had sent personal data from three Republican US senators to the Wikistranks of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were supported by "ultrapravic" scientists and websites.
"Lie, lie and other despicable lies," Waters said in her Twitter statement.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for US senators, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on the allegations of sexual abuse by candidate Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred sometime after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which source contributions, is linked to Waters office and has published information about Waters staff members, says Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly earned online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests he doesn't have the temper to be a member of Congress."
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They must not be defiant.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
They must be calm and not get excited."
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to democrat criticism toward Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it were true, it would be something,” he tweeted.
Waters stated in her statement that her office warned “the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions, which are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all my personnel."
Johnny English strikes again reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with British tendencies, which seems to be the case with Johnny English again in a series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this insolent satire be about how obviously bad a nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this bulging, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to screw things up in a whole new way - the name more than anything else by signaling that it is a broad comical creation designed for a non-English speaking cinematographic audience.
Of course, he's the dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a big piece of that guy who did a single note in Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The figure is also originally based on a traveler and an international mystery man who was once played by Atkinson in forgotten TV commercials by Barclaycard, who left chaos behind.
In this latest issue of JE there are one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached a helicopter in medieval armor, and the rotor blade was briefly dinged over his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite undersized and strangely redundant, especially when "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like it's intended for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy tramps are as resourceful and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in Mr. Bean's person.
The permanent assumption is that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated a British super-secret spy web network and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the horror of an agent on duty - far too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and biased figure who already suffers from a complete breakdown of political popularity: Emma Thompson plays this would-be Theresa May character as best as possible, but there is not much in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that once every active spy of hers is in danger, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now a CEO at some luxury facility, is also passing on record lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his long-suffering partner Bough, who was played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an affected figure that Vicki Pepperdine may even be wasting his talents on.
So Batman and Robin are back in action, packing her Majesty's secret service assignments, meeting with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously subject to the magic of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the sinister Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin with their odyssey full of farces: masked as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when smuggled aboard Volt's luxury yachts; and English triggers pure anarchy when they try using virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volt's house.
All the aces are definitely ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and stormy it is, it has something about children's television.
It's kind of a moderate thing.
And as with other Johnny English films, I couldn't think: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour deny that they would develop a plan for the English to work four days a week and get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan in which the British work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to hand over savings to workers that will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they'd still take the same reward.
Sources claim that this idea would "flip" into the party's economic agenda and plan to tilt the country to the benefit of its workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to use changing economies.
A long - term Labour member said for the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits the party's attitudes towards balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not our party's policy and does not take it into account".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from "anonymous directors" and "experts" in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not return to their overall share, because the Labour Government could carry out "clouds" on the basis of perceived wrongdoing.
It also confirmed the plans to put workers on the board of directors of companies and to create own-ownership funds, which will transfer 10% of the equity of private enterprises to employees entitled to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on "60 Minutes" whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might have changed their mind.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and begs the question of whether the Bureau's findings could swing some Republican senators into dragging their support.
In an interview from Sunday's "60 Minutes," correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to a hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the accusation came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, clear."
Graham's decision is unshakable.
"I've already made my decision over Brett Kavanaugh, and it would mean a very explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she named could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, offering a very impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission for the end of world poverty.
In the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival welcomes tens of thousands of people meeting in Central Park to enjoy not only artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poretta project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to obtain free admission to the event (if you were unwilling to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, email to the world leader, phone calls or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before he reached his goal?
Is it really the idea of rewarding people with a free concert in a way that convinces them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet will make a difference?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by his supporters, trying to achieve various goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and measures of more than $37 billion to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the hedged funds still have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a British partnership of investors and realists, who committed themselves to “helping children grow to their full potential,” promising Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of British government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can only make a note in history of social injustice in the form of malnutrition,” Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman Project told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions that called on U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website, asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty? ”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movement, we will succeed before us because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the performers in New York this year who will host Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy for a "blockade" that would prevent Russia's energy exports - the Home Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke revealed, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it is acting on the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to convey energy, as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States have the opportunity, with the help of our navy, to make sure that the maritime routes are open and blocked if necessary, to ensure that their energy is not directed to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed participants in an event organized by the consumer energy alliance, a non-profit group that is considered a "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less an investment in or the replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-purpose" player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes because the Trump administration is on the mission to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replaced Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, has turned Berlin into "the hostages" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s eager opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US took a position from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German Industry Organization, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the third state interfering with our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to take a closer look at the presidential candidacy in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the mid-term election, she would "closely look" at the presidential candidacy.
During the Holyoke City Hall meeting, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for office.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and repair our broken government, including the top female position," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will take a closer look at the presidential candidacy."
Warren mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that she was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I fear to the core what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open to her criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted that: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters do not think that it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-ranking democratic names that were mentioned in connection with the potential candidacy by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision in January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin to meet Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq following his listing in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, may concern other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries with which our soldiers are returning," she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "a elephant in the room" and said about her son and other war veterans that "they're coming back a little different, they're coming back tough, they're coming back asking if there's even any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the army is giving their country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with a domestic assault on a woman, interfering in a report of domestic violence and possession of a drunk weapon, reported Dan Bennett, spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal call for new US government measures that deny asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts on Friday in Washington issued a short report on Friday to support asylum seekers and question this measure, NBC said.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Organization against federal policy in August was not revealed.
She said that her partner “and his sons and members of a violent gang” abused her, but US officials refused her a request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace’s advocates described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing ubiquitous gang and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the US reversed the decision of the Board of Appeal for immigrants from 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Prosecutor General Karl Racine of D.C. stated in Friday's statement that the new measures "ignore decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a barrier violates this principle," said a short friend.
Lawyers further briefly argued that a policy that denies the entry of immigrants harms the US economy and says that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary work”.
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing from domestic and gang violence in June.
"Azyl is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or because of political opinion," he said in his statement of 11 June.
Asylum never aimed to alleviate all the problems - not even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palo, where the number of victims has risen twice already, are racing in search of survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusum, who comforted her feverish boy at the evacuation center in the parched city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance will bring more bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, choosing through drenched things, trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were paralyzed.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture to the spine and shoulder, rested at Palu's army hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued strong subsequent tremors.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the feeling that a violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared a room with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall," Haris said to the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
The US ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page ad in the American daily dedicated to the mutual advantages of US-China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump mentioned the China Daily bonus paid in the Des Moines register - the state of the biggest sales paper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the American elections marked what US officials said that Reuters was a new phase of the escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to advertise trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that manifests itself at the level of mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing injured American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China is now doubling this bullying by publishing propaganda advertising in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's valuable tradition of free expression and free press by placing paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find limited dissenting voices in the Beijing street newsstand, and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic career, given that the media belongs to the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish an offer” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are leaving their voters to vote for Kavanaugh's debacle. Analysts are warning.
As many top Republicans defend the candidate for Chief Judge Brett Kavanaug, who faces several charges of sexual assault, the analyst warned that during the upcoming midterm elections they would see a response, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this case were extremely high, and most Republicans on the record already say they want to continue the vote.
These things cannot be put back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) at the last minute was going to pursue an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down the voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "The November is coming!" at a demonstration in the senate hall, where Republicans who are in charge of the judicial commission decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it's been high, that's true."
However, it could be higher, especially between reluctant female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, but often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual assault charges against a high court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, resistance might follow.
"It became a baffled mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote in committee or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh will sit on the table, it’s also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, US priority director, a group that helps to vote for Democrats, pointed out the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in the opinion of whom to trust in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with somewhat more sympathy for the other appointed.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After pressure from Flake's FBI, he's currently investigating charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web network plans to start a new internet and beat Google and Facebook to it
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Berners-Lee Open Source Platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the goal of the Inrupt project was "world domination."
“We have to do it now,” he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all simultaneously.
What is exceptional about a personal online data repository is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
Society calls it "personal authority through data."
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to the CEO of John Bruce, to bring resources, processes and corresponding skills to help Solid platform to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some of the employees working on the project, collaborated on the project and community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, technological developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in his contribution to the media published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A celebration of the clergy who received the Victoria Cross during World War I
Celebrations of 100 years have taken place since the only spiritual Church of England gained Victoria’s cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, and he never knew that he had received the highest British military award.
His two grandsons revealed a memorial stone to him on Saturday at the Rushden parade, Northamptonshire.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “geniusly symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s triumphant work.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Lt Col Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense fog and heavy fire from field guns and machine guns."
Later he got to the front line and with the "highest courage" led the line forward before he threw himself into the firing field and knocked out three separate units.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72 - year - old Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, but at the same time something that was humiliating.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, after the show led by the youth group Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said that “he felt a great honor to participate in the parade,” adding that“ the trepidity of a true hero is manifested by the support provided by many people. ”
The MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206 instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine, you waited all night to watch the bloated Bellator 206, just to be denied the main event.
The San José receipt included 13 points, including six on the main card, and live broadcasts took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match, viewers in Great Britain were amazed when the news turned into a show about Peppa the Pig.
Some remained unexcited after waking up early in the morning for the game.
One of the Twitter fans described the change in the show for kids as "a sure form of a bad joke."
"According to government regulations, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., and therefore children's programmes must be broadcast," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communication of Bellator after being asked for this transmission.
"Peppa prag," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said that they would work on the program so that in the future the audience in the UK would be involved.
"I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably do it," Cooker said.
“But there is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not make it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when that program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We reduce it to five games instead of six – as we normally do – and we tried our best to keep the promise given to the fans and we failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less valuable" because of sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to follow success.
A 24-year-old athlete reported that he did not realize until he entered high school that “they are not all like him. ”
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, introduced by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hopes."
He also said that his ability to become a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, had a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared to be a survivor in Laverno's first program, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said: “Up until now, these feelings of inferiority and otherwise were real things that gave me strength and power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone", he said not to disappoint anyone who would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Bronze Olympic Medal has become a champion of LGBT rights with a high profile and has used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he called because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
This three-time world champion said that he was falling in love with a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “he caught him off guard.”
Daley took the Oscar holder, 20 years older, last year, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age – he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was not easy to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, a couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley said that he had "changed his whole angle".
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been all “I want to get a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't agree to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him - you won't be in the first place, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and only the moment he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
A year later, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that I had dreamed about it my whole life – jumping in front of our house owners at the Olympic Games, I didn't feel better," he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first song – Heather Small's stream – which resonated with him at the opening of the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on the bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson would have made a record on Sunday when he played the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he would have to tune up the form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the events held every two years at record number 12, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's fourballs and foursoms to the bench.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the US, a five-time main winner spent his day alternately between cheerleaders and working on a game in a row that he hoped would fix what troubled him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, not even at the top of his career, so he is not the ideal choice for a narrow field of Le Golf National, where long rugged terrain routinely punishes stray shots.
And if the golf course isn't disturbing enough in itself, Mickelson faces the exact British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who won all four of his games this week on the rookie Tommy Fleetwood team.
If the Americans, who had four points less, had started 12 separate swords, had escaped a quick entrance, Mickelson's machine could have proved to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband and gave nothing else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, pats me on the back, put his hand around my shoulders and said that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“They trust each other so much.
He is a member of the Hall of Straw, and in the past and this week he has been so beneficial to these teams.
I guess I just couldn't imagine him playing two machos.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson beats Nick Fald's record in most of the Ryder Cup Wests played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup, which never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson achieved 18 victories, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence of the team brought some intangible results.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great partner in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed the fun of seeing him this week, which was fun to observe.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the great lead leading to the singles of the last days in Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dan debuted at the game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they made it to the finish line with a very tight 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
"You must keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only close," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching when they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday in 2018 to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of that team showed me that it wasn't over.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Get in there and do all the right things.
It's not over until all the points are on the board.
We have a target, and that's to try and get the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, pleased with how his players did on a complex golf course, added: “I could never do it on my own.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
They're preparing individual performances tomorrow, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out with your partner when things are going well, but when you're there on your own, your golf player's capacity is fully tested.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players play better as individuals than as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these big twists when he was part of the winning team at Brooklin to end up a loser when Europe reached "The Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players to head to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklin, as in Medinah.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts considerable pressure on the middle games.
That's how we set up the routine and made the boys feel like you know, like we're supposed to be doing magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to counterattack Rory McIlroy in a top game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I went with that group of boys in that order, because I think it covers the whole journey, Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
German new warship postponed again
The latest German naval frigate was recognised in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and snowy shores, reports local media.
According to Die Zeit, the leader of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, a brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigate, was now postponed to the first half of 2019.
The vessel was to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems after delivery made the fate of this ambitious project difficult.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside home ports.
However, constant delays mean that the top ships – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas – will be obsolete by the time they were put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The infamous F125 frigate made it to the newspaper last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel in operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturer after the handover.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of major "software faults and faults on metal elements" faults that would make the warship useless when deployed into battle.
Software glitches were particularly significant, because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will operate a crew of some 120 sailors – half of the staff needed on the Bremen class frigates.
It has also proved that the ship has a considerable excess weight, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy’s ability to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfal ship will be twice as heavy as the class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides faults on metal elements, the price of the whole project – including crew training – is also a problem.
It is said that from the original EUR 2.2 billion, the price has risen to a staggering EUR 3.1 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates have become significant, particularly in the light of recent warnings that German maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, confirmed that the naval army was indeed "running out of ships capable of deployment."
This representative stated that the problems were constantly being packed because the old ships had been decommissioned, but no replacements had been provided.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's frigates are capable of being part of the Navy's equipment.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new research is being conducted at the housing estate of bats in the Highlands of Scotland to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt food.
There is hope that research findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help to manage future activities for the preservation of this species.
A study conducted by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will watch bats whistling and smallest and brown long and watery in the botanical garden of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas in this bat settlement, which will monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will detect the frequency of calling bats and what individual species do.
Subsequently, a habitat map and a message will be released to create a detailed landscape image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural resource conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are the most important for bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and best practice in maintaining wooded areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain have been largely dwindling in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and territorial development that affect colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of building materials, as well as cat attacks, may also pose a risk.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful in hunting prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, colony controls and sometimes rescue work.
This organization even established the first and only reserved bat reservation in the housing estate of Three in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten bat species in Scotland.
David Thompson, the estate manager, reports that this is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Three we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees and the best habitats.
But there is still too much we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand better what they need to survive."
It emphasizes the importance of checking bats before starting maintenance work in real estate, because it is possible that unconscious destruction of one motherly nest can kill up to 400 females and cubs, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to join in and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many species that we do not know how their populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape charges "false reports" and said that people "want to make themselves visible" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, who reported these charges.
This Portuguese man and attacker for Juventus were accused of raping an American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he subsequently paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, informing the daily Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the press release of the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers and called the information "false news."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-time winner of the Golden Ball for the camera.
“They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are about to charge the daily Der Spiegel with unfounded charges, which they called an "unacceptable announcement of suspicion in the private area".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for “moral damage equivalent to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations of recent times.”
The alleged incident was to take place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel suite and in the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting her at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the arcade, where she was reportedly raped anally, according to documentation filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her that he was a "99 per cent" of a "knave" and a "one per cent" of a failure.
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed he paid for sex, but he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "feared of retaliation" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims she's now seeking retrial because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronald at the time of the charge of attack one step away from the transfer to the Real Madrid Club from Manchester United and this summer it was bought by the famous Italian club Juve for EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Great Britain will forever regret losing car manufacturers
Great Britain “will regret forever” if it loses its world leader status in car production after Brexit, said Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of border delays in the absence of a Brexit agreement could cost jobs.
At a plant in Burnaston, where the cars Auris and Avensis are manufactured by Toyota brands – they produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would have seen production stopped at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW reports that it will close its Mini car factory in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers call risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is in operation on the basis of deliveries "just in time", with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU delivered for cars produced on order within 37 minutes.
If the UK left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a border breach, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, said the company, and thus would have stopped production.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plans to revitalise future relations with the EU are "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls."
“We need an agreement. We want the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the grasp of this opportunity,” he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The proof not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run, it warns that added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the trade union in the race, said that the members of the trade union are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that they will never come back once these places have disappeared.
The government spokesman said: "We have set up a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, reports the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with General Rod Rosenstein's acting attorney could be "delayed for another week" because he continues to fight for the position of supreme judge with Brett Kavanaugh, told the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the special council of Robert Mueller, who examines the interventions in the Russian elections, the ties between Trump's lieutenants and Russia and possible obstructions by the President.
Whether Trump releases the acting general agent and endangers Mueller's independence, Washington gossip has been feeding on it for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed carrying a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday at that time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he'd rather not release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid colliding with the Senate's court committee hearings where they gave testimony to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate vote again.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox Channel news on Sunday.
When asked to meet Rosenstein, she replied: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, perhaps it will be necessary to postpone another week with regard to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I will always communicate current information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not caused by the aversion to the "theatre" of TV reporters, even though she said, "I disagree with the fact that they will perform."
Subsequently, she suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without giving evidence. "We looked at the numbers."
The conferences will continue to be held, Sanders said, but “if press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly have been better than talking to me.
We're trying, and you've seen that we've been doing this in the last few weeks, and there's going to be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with attending senior officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why, with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
The health minister writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland to avoid fear of Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU employees working in NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to SMEs less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to settling the costs of requests for the state of settlement of EU citizens working in the public services transferred.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between Great Britain and the EU are continuing at a distance, and they are moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the British Government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible scenario of distance without agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reassure you once again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Fellow Members from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to the patients and communities to whom we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and our fervent wish is for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie progresses emergency surgery after head injury
Deployed defenseman Tigers from Tennessee Christion Abercrombie advanced an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's defeat 31-27 from rival Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sidelines and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Coaches and paramedics put oxygen on Abercrombie's sideline and then put it on a stretcher and prepared for further assessment.
A functionary from Tennessee told Chrisz Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details about the type/range of injuries” are yet available and that the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, sophomore in red T-shirt, takes the first season for Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday he had five total interventions, which means a total of 18 operations in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when purchasing real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax if they buy a property in the UK, while the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corby's move to attract young voters
The increase in the obligation of higher property tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
Expecting an increase in the Treasury by £120 million a year – to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they buy a real estate in the UK, while extra money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May announces today.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and focus on high-income people.
The increase in property purchase tax will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, while money will also strengthen the government’s efforts to fight sleeping without a roof over their heads.
The surcharge, which is an addendum to the current obligation to pay property purchase tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago at other houses and the purchase for rental purposes, can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury is expected to increase its funds by up to £120 million a year.
Estimates say that 13 percent of citizens who are not UK residents buy newly built properties in London, which drives prices away and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the ladder.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital city – have become "spirit cities" precisely because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new principles only appeared a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction on the purchase of real estate to help more young people to their own first house.
He accused large construction firms of holding real estate prices high by taking up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to correct the “favor of home” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a striking series of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the termination of the "negligible" evictions.
It also wants to increase the powers of the committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to devote my efforts as prime ministers to restoring the British dream – so that every new generation would have a better life.
And that means fixing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and shape life.
However, it cannot be right for it to be easy for entities that do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to be able to buy houses as well as hard-working UK residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the shame of sleeping without a roof over their heads is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to run Scotland"
Head of Sunderland Jack Ross reports that it is his "highest ambition" to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
42-year-old Scots enjoy the challenge of restoring the Northeast Club, which currently holds a third position in the First League, only three degrees below the summit.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after last season he brought St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership League.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the rank B and it was done," said Ross at BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and that’s always something that pulls me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I was successful in running the club."
Ross’ predecessors as Sunderland’s managers were Dick Advocates, David Moyas, Sam Allardyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any anxiety about the succession of such established names in such a big club when he had previously rejected foreplays from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success would be measured for me at that time by asking if I can return this club to the Premier League.
Due to the structure and equipment in this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to put him back there, but I'd probably feel successful if I could just put the club back there."
Ross has only been in the lead for three years, before acting as assistant boss at Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
Then he helped Club Alloa recover from the descent into the third group and transformed St Mirren from the beginning decline into the winner of the champions’ title in the following season.
And Ross says he's got a much better feeling now than he's ever had in his career players in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"They were probably real intersections," he recalls the time when Allo took over.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than acting.
It sounds weird because I was good, making good money and enjoying a reasonable height.
But acting can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I keep going through them in terms of the stress and the pressure of the job, but I just feel good about the management.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and I feel like I feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life."

Research found that the perfect time for a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased the incomes of British pubs struggling with difficulties, but has increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that pub and bar groups recorded an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July – but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s consulting firm, who produced the final reports, said: “Stable sunshine and longer than expected participation by England in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to that of the previous June, when pub attendance increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June worsened even further in July.
Up until now, pubs and drinking bars have done the strongest in the way the restaurants have offended themselves.
Pubs, whose main sales are from food, have also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent per month, while the sale of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, of an analytical company of leisure activities and hospitality, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
The weather and influence of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the food chains continue to fight, although the annual drop in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of the ongoing pressures on costs.
A long hot summer cannot be a worse time for food-gathering operators, and time will tell whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much needed relief."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the British sector of pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, which is an established industrial benchmark in the sector.
One in five children has a secret social media account that hides from their parents
One in five children – only 11 years of age – has a secret social media account that hides from parents and teachers, showing research
Research among 20,000 high school students showed an increase in "false Instagram sites"
Reports have raised fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of pupils reported having a “main” account that parents know about
One in five children – at the age of only 11 years – creates accounts in social networks that they hide from their parents.
A survey among 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in “false Instagram accounts” in which they share photographs.
Reports point to concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the pupils said that they have a beautified “main” account that parents know about, and at the same time they have a private account.
One mother who stumbled onto her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website found that her teenage girl was encouraging others to “rape her.”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, while half admit to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Scottish athletic committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an inefficient director at the annual General Meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most prized lightweight athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in charge of sports like those for whom her far-reaching international experience will be useful in the past decade.
"Eilidh has extensive respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community, and we are sure that it will be very beneficial for athletics in Scotland to be a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be the voice of athletes, and I hope to be truly beneficial and to help lead the sport in Scotland. ”
An American who won a total of four gold medals at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, won a total of 200 and 400 metres, and is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after a transitory ischemic atation.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had an attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I was going to get better or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've made a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing exercises!
Thanks for all the encouraging news!"
The milk-sucking apparition of mothers to cows divides opinions online
The company involved in the production of suction pumps divided online opinion by advertising, which compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
As part of the launch of Envi's "first silent suction devices in the world", Envi released a music video with exaggeration showing the freedom that the new suction device gives to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn full of hay with cows for a song, saying, "Yes, I'm going to eat, but you don't see any tail," and "In case you haven't noticed I don't have udders, my boobs are here."
The choir continues: "Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, feed my beloved milk."
However, the advertising that was posted on the company’s Facebook page triggered controversial online reactions.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of whom reported that it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“A very poor decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth," says one of the comments.
Elvie suction is applied discreetly to breast-feeding (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added: “The ad is completely off. ”
Even those who defended advertising have appeared, while one woman admitted that she considered the song “infectious.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I was still breast-feeding.
Suction makes me feel just like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's a good thing.
It is a brilliant product," wrote one user.
Another said: “It’s a fun ad focused on mothers who suck their milk (often at work or on toilets) and feel like “cows.”
It is not an advertisement to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all dance with discreet suctions hidden under their bras.
The campaign concept is based on the observation that a lot of women who suck their milk say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's suction machine is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and hides beautifully in a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold a child and even walk while suctioning.
Ana Balarin, a mother’s partner and ECD, added the comment: “The Elvie suction machine is so revolutionary that it deserves a strong and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and milking cows, we wanted to point out the suckling of milk and all the challenges associated with it while showing a fun and reliable incredible sense of freedom that the new suction will ensure.
It's not the first time Elvie's suction has ever been in the sun.
During the London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers, designer Marta Jakubowski, appeared on the pier, who was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrants' children detained has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially because hard rhetoric and the principles introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most of the companions were traditionally made up of non-documented immigrants who were afraid of endangering the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to be one of the children.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households had to provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had requested the status of escorting single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of those who are sponsors or members of the home of sponsors are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to prosecute them," said Mr.Albence.
According to asylum workers, officials have introduced new rules in order to process children’s affairs more quickly, requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained instead of earlier standard 60 days.
Many appear through calls within the video conference instead of personally declaring their case to be a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who, according to the report, are not entitled to help will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely he is to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbursts of rage or attempts to escape, claims asylum workers, and reports from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say that these concerns are raised in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where there are indications that the child is suffering, more likely to be ignored, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or farewell to friends could cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria has announced that US, French and Turkish “occupational forces” should withdraw immediately
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also called after the return of Syrian refugees home, even though there is already the eighth year of war in the country.
Moual, who is also acting prime minister, said that foreign forces in Syria are illegally under the pretext of combating terrorism and that “it will be handled accordingly.”
"He must surrender immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism in Syria was almost over,” with more than 360,000 deaths since 2011, and millions more lost their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegally present foreigners."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the territory of a war-torn country.
When giving up refugees, Moualem declared that there were good conditions for them to return and accused “some Western countries” of spreading “unrational fears” that caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We approached international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no help for Syria to recover until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protection zone in the last refuge of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward in political debates.
Russia-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by the Syrian forces shielded by Russia on the province where three million people live.
Moualem pointed out, however, that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that the military intervention would be aimed at jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters with ties to Al-Qaeda, who would “be exterminated.”
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of the new committee, consisting of members of the government and opposition, will soon take place to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "controlling the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning against intervention.
Why Trump will win in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would have won the next 2020 election if, as many liberal observers would have hoped, the prosecution and scandals would not have ended his office prematurely as president.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidential period in history! ”
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, ratings in prime time have more than doubled to 1.05 million per CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average rating of 2.4 million in prime time, an increase of 1.7 million four years ago according to Nielsen and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has increased the ratings on cable TV to 3.5 million watching the main night news.
"It's a heat that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the operator of "Designed Survivor" on ABC drama about the Cabinet Secretary, who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
Why? she asked
"He said, "Because he's funny," said Mrs Scovell.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story of Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wada, whether the immigrant families can reconnect and for the benefit of the global economy.
Tuning is a luxury that only the most privileged watchers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you're an informed citizen when you've been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses the "deep backup" resources for his book "Fear," ostrich Paul Manafort leather jackets worth $15,000 ("dressing arrogance" as Washington Post said) and the consequences of the disgusting depiction of Mr Trump Storm Daniels's "anatomy".
Among other things, I'm not going to watch Super Mario the same way again.

When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny out on the north bank of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't tear himself away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we did all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money flows to the tightest home races in the mid-term elections
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a financial inflow through the reorganization of congressional districts, which generated two holders of office in the fight for the same chair.
This recently led to the reconstruction of the suburban district of Pittsburgh by Democratic Republican Conor Lamb – who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania issued an opinion in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans, the maps were redrawed.
The race in the new 17th district started with a fierce financial dispute between the financial branches of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special elections to the 18th Congressional District.
This chair has been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and Donald Trump has won by 20 points in the precinct.
Policy experts give the Democrats a slight head start.
America is considering fine Salvador for support of China, then retreating
Diplomatics have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged Beijing under moderate pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners court-imposed Trump's organization team.
The representatives of the State Department decided to call off the US Director of Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “unfortunate decisions not to acknowledge Taiwan anymore,” said Minister's spokesperson Heather Nauert in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the fines were only considered against Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million of US aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included reducing financial assistance and focusing on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
With ongoing internal negotiations, North American and Central American leaders postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading for the US.
But by mid-September, the leaders explained that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively complete any fines under consideration for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of solving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the signal that the administration puts in the meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without having any new hard news from Washington.
White House spokesperson Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst close to government executive and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
Robert Mueller's report from the Special Commission on the possible obstruction of Mr Trump's law enforcement, which is now in public records, could be the ultimate nail in the coffin.
In his investigation, Mr Mueller is said to have turned to whether Mr Trump's campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia to attack our elections.
If there were an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr Trump would have to take responsibility for this institution, just as he is preparing to re-emerge before the voters, and in the end he would probably be expected by a jury composed of his colleagues.
This is a whole series of 'if', and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as is the case with such politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice ahead of us that will affect how much longer suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to hold a coup against Hitler, all they needed was for the Western powers to stand up to him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the relentless course of democracy.
The Americans are now facing several similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein here, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been on edge since the report announced that he had secretly proposed to record the president last year and speculated that he was in no state of health to hold the presidency.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inaccurate.
“How do we react if the newly requested F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh investigation is not complete or fair – or what if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, will we vote for Congress in the middle of the term of office, which will put Mr Trump to account?
If we fail these trials, democracy will have a long dark night.
But I believe we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles on a swastika table.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians would give them a great deal of hope for the G Group of the European League after an impressive draw in Spain on the Villarreal field earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented backup Graham Dorrans from appearing on the field for the first time in the season until 2-2 with Villarreal. However, they believe that the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team,” said a 31-year-old player.
“We went into a game of faith that we could grab something, and we took away a point.
We may have been able to reproduce it at the end, but overall, the tie was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half, we got better and we were better.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be hard, because in the last game they played a good result. But with the spectators behind my back, I'm sure we can push and it'll work out fine.
Last year was pretty tough, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team's strong, and the guys are really enjoying it, the training's good, too.
I hope we'll get back to it now, get over it last season, and be successful."
Women are worried about their pension savings.
Although the surveyers had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the people in the national study said that they were discussing the price of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said she was talking to her kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they are not willing to discuss it with him," explains Holly Snyder, vice president of a national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless you reveal your wishes in advance.
Together with your advisor and family, discuss where and how to receive care, as these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Invite your financial advisor: A consultant can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed by, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance that will help you pay for these expenses or by own insurance using your own funds – as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battles while you can.
Select a healthcare representative, who will be a trustworthy person to supervise your medical care and ensure that doctors respect your wishes if you cannot communicate on your own.
Also consider drawing up a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who will take financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid in case you are not qualified to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your old parent urgently needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Put these details in the written plan so that you are ready.
“The game is not just finance, but what are the names of the treating physicians, for example?" asks Martin.
“Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready at hand."

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the authorities are expected to increase the number of victims.
Since communication is out of order, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Regenty Donggala, which is the area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
After the outbreak of the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pal.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and its population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the northwest island of Sulawesi.
The regency, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main components of the economics of Central Sulawesi province are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also significant in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunami has hit Palu and Donggal several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
Tsunami struck west Donggaly even in 1996, when she claimed nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and earthquakes regularly occur here.
Here's a list of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh Province.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 degree earthquake hit the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 degree earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: The 7.5 earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 metres high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake hit the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh Province and caused destruction and panic because it reminded people of the devastating effects of the 2004 death earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami formed, but more than 100 died because of falling buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29 - year - old Palin, living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, intruding on reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin has been sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, reports KTUU.
According to a network report, he appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself “definitely innocent ” when he was asked to comment.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and to a fine of up to USD 250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with class B infraction punishable by a one-day prison and a fine of USD 2000.
It's not the first time Palin has to face criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged assault on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin, on the phone.
The case is currently before the Alaskan War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics associated with the incident.
He allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups when her son’s violent behavior was linked to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday.
The 7.5 degree earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks are off-line, and in the coming days, casualties are expected to rise.
The earthquake struck directly at the friction of the island of Sulawesi, which is located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There were videos on social media depicting the moment of disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding an exceptional death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York apply for the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died – an exceptional punishment that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly launched an attack on a bicycle trail along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan with a rented Home Depot truck that was swept away by pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a number of injuries – this is how the terms of the intention to grant the death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York Court.
According to the court documents, both of these figures would constitute the possibility of granting the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury accused Saipo of 22 crimes, including murder charges in favor of extortion, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and allegations of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and preparation," claims the prosecutors, describing the way Saipov carried out the act as heinous, cruel and perverse."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," he says.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York court last issued the death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with a federal case in New York City in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, who were proven to be a conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal regret during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipo's accusation, he told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching Islamic State videos on the phone.
Police also announced that they also requested the flag of the Islamic State to be posted in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipo, said that they were "obviously disappointed" by the plaintiffs' decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a plea and a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
A team of Saipov's defense attorneys had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
According to members of the Conservative Party, he should be entrusted with the Brexit negotiations of NIGEL FARAGE
During today's protest at the Conservative Party Conference, Nigel Farage pledged to "mobilize the army of the people".
Former UK Independence Party leader said that politicians must feel pressure from Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s own Members suggested, he should be conducting negotiations with the EU.
A number of conservative MPs, Peter Bone, declared during his march in Birmingham that Britain would be out by now if Mr Farage were to be secretary for Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in making up for her own ranks, where there is a deep division, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting to stay in the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his compromise plan from the Chequers going under the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who remain in the Union and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that they continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the "chaos".
Mr Bone said that the Leave Means Leave group will gather in Solihull, where he wanted to "screw the Chequers".
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
MEP Wellingborough added: "I'll stand up for Brexit, but we have to ditch the Chequers."
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to have to listen.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone has rejected the proposals that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to remain is completely misguided."
Conservative supporter Brexit Andrea Jenkynsová, who also participated in the march, told reporters: "Simply I say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and our party members do not like him or our activists who currently fill the streets so that we can be elected.
Forget about the Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp report to Mrs May, she says: 'Minister chairmen will keep their place when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage said that conservative politicians must "get into an awkward situation" if they want to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - people - and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we stand here today to say to them, "We will not let you do that."
He added in the report to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"Now we are mobilizing an army of the people of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Great Britain that rules itself."
Meanwhile, advocates of staying in the Union marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners to the Conservative against Brexit after the weekend opening of the party's operation.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives because of the party's security issues after the conference began.
"These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"The whole thing's a farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit,” he added.
Warren's planning to think twice about running for president.
American Senator Elizabeth Warren declared that after the November election, she would “think carefully about running for president.”
Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts has spoken about her future on Saturday at the city hall in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is attempting to re-election in November against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself at the center of speculation that she could confront Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning on applying for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means a woman in the highest place. ”
He was arrested by a suspect in the shooting of Sims from LSU.
Baton Rouge Police, La., reported on Saturday that she arrested a suspect from shooting a basketball player at the LSU Wayd Sims team on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00.
A video was released from Friday's shooting requesting identification of the man caught on tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which was incompatible with life," Police Commander Murphy J. Paul told the media through the 247sports website on Saturday.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to moving around the scene, had a gun, and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was wiped out without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
6 feet and 6 inches tall Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, of which 10 were last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russia’s Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of World Champion when the team director put him in the hands of the victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished qualifying Saturday before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team director would play a big role in the race.
From the field position Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two corners he defended his position and challenged Vettel to attack the team partner.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton catch up with the cars circling the tail of the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider drove into the depot one lap later and after the exit he was behind Vettel. However Hamilton went forward and in a close battle the Ferrari had to reluctantly leave the inner runway open so that he could defend himself in the third turn after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen set off from the rear row of the driving field and at the end of the first round he was in the lead on his 21st birthday.
Then he led for a large part of the race, because he kept the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the quick finish and to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally he drove to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer raise the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the reward is the first two jobs," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's assembly for insisting that she hadn't published a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the testimony given to Ford before the Senate Judiciary Commission, instead he stated that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil and repulsive and lying.”
"One thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has been happening in Senar these last days, when you see the rage, when you see these people being angry and evil and repulsive and lying," he said.
“If you look at the release and publication and they say, "Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you blame the leak?
Remember her answer... did you post the document - oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Well, wait a minute.
We published... No, not at all," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent Ford a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and information leaked early in September – but Feinstein refused to let her office leak.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, nor did I disclose information about the case," said Klomi Feinstein, as he informed The Hill.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, her words seem to not be believed by the president who commented on the case at the meeting on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this is a really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it's definitely the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate for a Supreme Court judge accused of sexual harassment by three women and indicated that the Democrats were using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back the power by any means possible.
You see the evil, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to stomp into the ground to get back to power and the helm," he quoted.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars fixed Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's rematch in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took over the two-goal lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier's interventions.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle for homestead before Dwyer brought the Giants back to lead.
Francois Bouchard then straightened up for Dundee, then two goals Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for the team Adam Keefe, who managed to beat 2-1 on Friday in Belfast Dundee.
Both teams met for the fourth time in the season, and all three previous matches were dominated by Giants players.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m., under the assistance of Kendall McFaulla, while David Rutherford scored the assist on Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got the landlord back in the game in time 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who compared it in time 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabins for the first break in the lead after he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The landlords have regrouped and Bouchard has once again managed to match the goal of the power play at 27:37.
The joint work of Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen to swing the lead on Dundee later in the second period of the game for the first time, and the same player insured the leadership of his team in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play another game at home on Friday at Milton Keynes.
The air traffic manager died to allow hundreds of people aboard the plane to escape earthquakes
The air traffic manager in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died while overseeing the flight with hundreds of people on board safely to take off.
More than 800 people were killed, and many are missing after the great earthquake that caused the tsunami rocked Sulawesi Island on Friday.
The severe aftershocks flooded the area, and many remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Pal.
But despite the fact that colleagues of 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung were fleeing to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in a wildly writhing control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower down when he thought he was sliding down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for air traffic control, told Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We've arranged a helicopter transport from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, where he was taken to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for solving the disaster stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The number of deaths continues to increase, as many bodies still remain unscathed under the wreck and many of them still haven't been reached by rescuers," said Sutopo Purwo Nugro's spokesperson.
The waves in the devastated Palu reached a height of up to 20 feet [6 m]. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Both military and civilian aircraft bring assistance and supplies to the affected sites.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies in.
There's a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s military forces: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" said CNN station.
This year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that after a plane crash in the lagoon, one person is missing.
An airline operating a flight that crashed in a lagoon on one of the micronesian islands in the Pacific has now stated that one person is missing, stating in the beginning that all passengers and crew of 47 have safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported in a press release that she was unable to find a traveling man on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in search of a missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the requirements for providing details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped in the rescue of other passengers and crews after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials claimed that a total of seven persons had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the treatment on Saturday and they were all in stable condition.
But what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane had landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane was landing from a very low altitude.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that along with the others he managed to reach the emergency exits of a sinking plane with water to the bottom of the belt.
He further stated that the onboard staff panicked and yelled and that he himself suffered minor injuries to the head.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who were working nearby to adjust the dock helped to rescue by an inflatable boat carrying passengers to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
The data from Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades, 111 people have died in PNG aircraft accidents, but no accident has occurred to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution ended its speech on Saturday in this case, in which a man is repeatedly tried to burn a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The US Department of Justice in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours and provided expert reports in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury analyst sketched the script he used on the cell phone 29 of the defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he had obtained localization data from several cell phones, which showed that Tellis was at Chambers's company on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous testimony, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When his cell phone data showed that he had spent the night with Chambers, he noted that he was with his boyfriend Michael Sanford, who the police visited.
Sanford stood trial on Saturday and testified that the day in question was not in town.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was lying because my car was in Nashville that night.
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks on the day she died.
However, cell phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis erased Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it completely from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to come before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about this genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed band from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
So they want to go back to their roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have already experienced a revival in the recent past thanks to such artists as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?
A New York governess sues a couple for her firing after a "racist" text message
New York City governess sues a couple for their discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongly sent text message from her mother, in which she was described as "another black woman" text message.
The couple refused to be racist and compared the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dismay when she found out on her first day of work in 2016 that the new governess of her children, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
"NEOEEEEEEE, OTHER GERMAN," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice and said that her just leaving governess, who was African-American, was working really badly and that she was expecting Filipino instead, said the New York Post.
Mrs Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for compensation for sacking her job and asking for compensation of USD 350 for the six-month engagement for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not done," the Post said this Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
However, the couple returned the strike with the fact that they were not racists, but that ending Mrs Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure, because they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her after the insult.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racist," said her husband, Joel Plasco, Post.
“But would you place your child in the hands of someone you treated rudely, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Oh, come on."
Plasco likened a "extortion" suit and stated that his wife only cared for a two-month-old child and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Would you be riding someone like that?
That is not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Although the lawsuit still persists, the jury on social media condemned the couple very quickly for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of stories about Paddington the bear feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, showed the latest news
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, told the rapporteur: “It is difficult to empathize with someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very amusing to know that now that we know the great success of Paddington the bear."
She stated that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, she added on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became a "sweet bitter" dot after his death last year.
To Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of her family, ” she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite quiet, never boastful," she said.
“But since Paddington was such a real figure to him, it was like you had a child who achieved something that you could really be proud of.
I believe he was looking at Paddington's success with that perspective.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his achievements only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that she did not expect to get out of it," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nadia, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
So I did.
I said, “Tash, I love you so much.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart running slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was shut down.
I just had to sit around and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it inside of me."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers without showing what a difficult test she is going through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
“I kept my head down, tears were running down my cheeks all the time.
It's difficult to explain, but it was just during the flight that I felt an overwhelming understanding of Nado.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending postcards to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can look for support on.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and as a result, he took his own life at 18.
"I wouldn't want any other parent to have to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young cook with an infectious smile.
“Everybody knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile could light up every room."
However, before his death, he left work because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his sibling’s still body after taking his own life.
Says Mrs. Davis: “I am constantly worried about the impact that this will have on his life. ”
Mrs Davis suggested postcards “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they are friends.
Do not sit silent - you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is an elderly friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he was feeling down, or depressed, anything at all," he explains.
“A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his behavior.
The worst thing was on Christmas Eve - when the kids opened the presents, didn't look at them, nothing."
She said that her partner’s death was a huge trauma to them, but that they must gradually get over it: “This kind of thing can make a hole in the family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought we could get something that he was actually asking for – an investigation at a time of restriction, with limited scope – we could bring a little unity into it," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "break up" because both sides would bury themselves in captured positions after partisanism.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away from us, on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to do badly, this will lead to a major weakening in their attempts to enforce the man they asked for to stand in the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush and through him met with his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI compiles a report?
The Senate will vote on this and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Yet it is unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm in the Supreme Court.
The numbers of refugees from North Korea for Kim have "declined"
The number of refugees from North to South Korea has fallen since the beginning of Kim Jong-Un's reign seven years ago, claims the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said that there have been 1127 escapes in the last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that more stringent border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates required by border smugglers are behind this.
Pyongyang has not issued a public declaration.
Today, the vast majority of refugees from the North are receiving an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relations between North and South – which are still technically in a state of war – have improved markedly in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on halted denuclearization negotiations.
This took place in the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions of cooperation in nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister, Ri Jong-ho, accused the US of making no progress on sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to be unilaterally disarmed," Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader of the democratic minority, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate "hysterical" and said that because of her temperament, she was unfit for duty at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this remark in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if any woman had ever performed such a theatre, they would have called it “hysterical,” Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh’s Thursday statement before the Senate Judiciary Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all charges that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both still teenagers.
during his opening words, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and suffocating in dealing with his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the committee and stated that their accusations against him were a “grotesque and coordinated attack” organised by liberals who failed to get past Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because he showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he relied on the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi answered the negative question as to whether she would have tried to appeal Kavanaugh if he had been confirmed, even if the Democrats had obtained the majority of the representatives in the House.
"I will tell you this - if he is not telling Congress the truth, then she is not only qualified for the work of the Supreme Court, but also for the court she is currently working on," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential returns in the Accordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because she was considered a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would reverse any decisions of the Supreme Court as part of the hearings prior to his appointment.
"There is no time for a hysterical, preconceived person to go to court and expect us to just say, "Oh, my God, it's beautiful," said Pelosi.
And women have to rule it.
After verbal attacks, months and years of resentment, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “A woman who was a principal somewhere who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, which means that when she was angry and started to cry, she said to the person she was talking to: “Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she continued to do so.
And I think that's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office dominated by men. I once expressed my unexpressible anger by crying. But an older, always cold manager, who I was always a little worried about, grabbed my neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never show them you're crying," she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an illegitimate affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she told me, laughing after 30 years.
“Seven more candidates have been running, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
But since the campaign had been running for a long time, she couldn't keep up with the donations, so she made a commitment not to get into the game unless she got $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Does she think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, with frustration with a system that made it difficult for her to raise money and focus on voters rather than on delegates and anger over sexism, that she was completely suffocating with anger.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said about how the press responded.
“And you might think that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they were gonna write on my headstone.
"Was she crying?"
Why can the Sino-American trade war be good for Beijing
The initial salva trade war between the US and China was deafening and, although the battle is far from being fought, according to experts between being a crack between countries in the long term beneficial for Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, provided the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
But most of the most important escalations saw the light of day this week, when new tariffs were announced on goods worth USD 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion), which basically means taxing half of China’s trade exports to the US.
Beijing has always responded, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of the 60 billion-dollar imports of American goods.
China tried to repay the US with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economy would kneel on its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to get back on track, it would mean giving in to his demands, but public submission to American demands would be totally humiliating for Chinese President Si Jinping.
Yet experts think that if Beijing could play his cards right, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run, because it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
“The fact is that the rapid political decisions of Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic corkscrew in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have admitted so far,” said Abigail Grace, research colleague, who focuses on Asia in the Think Tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, claims the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
At the UN General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's situation in the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives, are now met.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million people since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored insurgents.
Europe responded decisively to the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Evria won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US Team with a final score of 16,5 to 10.5 on the field of Le Golf National on the edge of the difficulties in France.
The US has now lost for the sixth consecutive time on European soil, so it has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
The star of the United States, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then blew the ball into the water at 3 par 16th hole and let Francesco Molinari win.
Italian golfer Molinari then shined in all his rounds and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth has been defeated by 5 and 4 players from the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Top rated world player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who apparently completed his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia has become overall the best European player with 25,5 points earned in his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy to get the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He handed the cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded a career record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won the 14 biggest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can compare.
The US team struggled all weekend to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed top golf throughout the tournament.
After the unsatisfying results of his team, US captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of those boys, they really fought.
We really warmed Europe up this morning.
We really didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could be their captain.
I really have to pull out.
You played us."
Update on the red tide: Concentrations are reduced in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to the overall decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, stains of blooming water are now reported from the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this indicates a declining concentration.
The blooming water of the red tide extends about 130 miles of coastline from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
The stains were observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but last week it was already relatively fewer places.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
In Hillsborough County, low to high concentrations were observed, the lowest to high concentrations in Manatee County, the lowest to high concentrations in the coast or in the high seas of Sarasota County, the lowest to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, the lowest to high concentrations in the coast or in the high seas of Lee County and the low concentrations in Collier County were observed.
Respiratory irritations continue to occur in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Respiratory irritation was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
