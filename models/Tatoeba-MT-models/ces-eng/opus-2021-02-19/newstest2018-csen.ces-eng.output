The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advantage of Color People (NAACP) published a warning for color people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory principles of the state and racist attacks.
"The NAACP's travel recommendation for Missouri, effective from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention when travelling across the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state," says the Association.
The NAACP stated that this action was taken on the basis of the current laws of the state of Missouri, which make it difficult to defend racistally motivated acts in court, as well as the conduct of law enforcement authorities that disproportionately target minorities.
‘Civil rights are being violated.
People are stopped by police only because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," said the Kansas City Star President of the NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We still have the largest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to the state of the US.
Among the incidents quoted by the organization were racially motivated abuses directed against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in question at the beginning of this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and was thrown into custody by the police without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also highlights the recent statement by the Attorney General of Missouri, which states that black drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared - they should carry money to pay for bail or alert their relatives that they are about to travel by the state."
According to the current numbers of the FBI program for reporting hate crimes in 2015, there were a hundred cases of hate behavior in Missouri, which puts the state at 16th place among all states.
The travel warning is also the answer to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after the states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on the basis of violations of this law, which according to ACLU is to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but recently the advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family isn't at peace after 12 years!
Sally Anne Bowman's model is murdered.
A girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie in a restaurant she worked in, who stabbed her.
Both the victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then kill her.
The killer then sat in a nearby coffee shop and watched a thorough crime scene examination work.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to 34 years in 2008 for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only confessed in court to assaulting a juvenile, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie said Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were arguing on fateful nights.
The killer said, "He was really upset, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of the taxi driver," he said lyingly.
The girl, according to his testimony, should have fought back, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and she accused him.
After confessing to Dixie, he talked about his hornyness and taste for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was at his ex-girlfriend's, drinking alcohol, and taking cocaine, that's what Dexie himself told the police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," the Mirror Linda added.
And after 12 years, the family faces more vandal attacks destroying her grave.
It's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people at large who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Mirror mother of the late girl Linda revealed information about the disappearance of the urn with ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are neither violent nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who operates Prague's Intimacy boutique.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started inconspicuously, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling trip around Moravia.
One of them brought not only his bike, but also a box full of extraordinary looking vibrators.
"Miscellaneous moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend and another partner decided to cooperate with the German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which attracted Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he operates an Intimity boutique in Prague's Benedict Street, where he sells erotic aids in the way luxurious handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why not?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, this is what you talk about at lunch, you say?
Oh, come on, don't be such a puritan!
The Berlin Fun Factory, designed by the renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
It was opened in 2010, and it was a completely different concept of erotic business than everyone here is used to.
No hidden windows, all made in a beautiful, decent style, more like perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to consider how to handle Prague's business, where it should be and what it should be called.
Intimacy's name appealed to both of them.
"It has to do with intimacy, and it is also, you can say, tender," he says.
There followed the purchase of an internet domain and the search for suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
Finally, the variant, which spread the shop into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom, dominated by the bed, won.
Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio prepared it for us.
We found space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem ideal, because he wasn't on the main street, but he was sitting next to the name Intimacy.
He's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one's looking at the customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a business that would be different, with brand-new nice goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And don't make them ashamed to even enter that kind of business.
When I walked into the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like going to the sex store.
Just outside the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior I know from fashion boutiques.
Even though there's only female service in the store, it doesn't mean that women don't hesitate to ask for help, it doesn't mean a man's foot doesn't come here.
Most gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't guess the right size and choose bigger," Martin smiles over a frequent mistake.
It's the prejudices, the clichés, that women need some big tools, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith might choose an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black underwear, while women tend to tend to pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product aptly called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's like a non-contact clitoris stimulator.
I have an adolescent need to laugh with admiration at the serious tone with which the interpretation is given to me.
It's like it's not getting old.
And it doesn't actually stick.
It's at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
It's kind of the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator shaped like a seahorse.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He completely demolished taboos that may persist in some men, seeing competition in erotic aids.
"Different variations are being made," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with a remote control.
That's a favorite category.
In a love connection, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of vibration.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least it's our place.
Czech women seem to prefer multipurpose tools and buy classic vibrators, even though they use them only externally.
In Western Europe, especially with younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it'd have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin considers.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." It is mainly sold by the masturbator, in this case by the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or futuristic object.
They focus a lot on functionality and experience during use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese women were a big fan of erotic aids, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," he explained.
The ordinary one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with women using them.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboos for women." For the record, what the Japanese brand Tenga, represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not intrusive.
On the contrary, we are quite an accommodating nation.
Definitely unlike countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical business client is between 35 and 50 years old and has "a certain experience with both sex life and with some aids.
Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka will come for something nice, better to fill her partner's life with, or for themselves." Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka care so much that they convince each product that it is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to get into bondage and latex specials, because we don't have room for that either, and it doesn't really fit here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are people who've always been shy of going to the sex shop because they were afraid something like that would pop up on them.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really nice.
It is also determined by the selection of represented renowned brands.
Some of them have even won design prizes, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awarded was the mentioned sea horse 'and this triggered a change in the entire sector.
It began to be abandoned from cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with the unfailing, to produce different designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that the design of some is supported by the Czech Republic, namely popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say, I was quite surprised how many people in our country buy the designer stuff Whoop.de.doo from Anna Mareš, even though they are relatively expensive.
There are customers who come straight for Venus' marbles by Anna Mareš.
She did a really huge job by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story started out as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to control the production process and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it is not a large production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than a large series.
I may go a little upstream, but it seems important to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It could easily happen that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything," Anna later describes to me, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
He does not encounter a negative or negative attitude.
They say people are embarrassed at most.
Anna Marešová currently has a vibrator on offer, for which you can get a personal message, and this year she plans her own lubricant.
In the next year, there should be more vibrating eggs and more news.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the limits of what's right lie.
Is there anything Martin Ráž wouldn't sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What seems normal to one may seem completely abnormal to another, so we define ourselves more by a range of branded manufacturers.
None of them go into extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one final question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just this week, an e-mail came in asking for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a natural 20 cm long.
Well, we had to tell her we didn't have anything like that.
The question is whether anyone was making fun of us," Martin takes a suspicious look at me.
Even that happens from time to time...
A blow for Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Štědrý is fighting a serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend fights a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, it is unfortunately true," confirmed the sad information of Lightning himself singer.
I know about my illness, and so far, under the circumstances, I'm handling it.
"I take drugs that have associated phenomena of disease to slow down," he added, thanking the loved ones for their support.
The whole branched family came together to make Karl's life easier.
Eva's wife is trying to stay home as much as possible, her daughter from the first marriage of Zuzana and Tereza arrives behind her father in the house in Bílá Hora, the son Karel said Karlas.

"I have been told by an astrologer that I will be here by 90," said Karel Lightning.
He's a fighter.
She still wants to sing.
"I repeat the words of songs so I won't forget them," said Karel.
Actress Květa Purple is now fighting the same disease in the institution.
Do you have a Alzheimer's patient in your family?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will be reviewed by the C.O.S.
An absolute ban on abortion is still in force in Chile, so it must not be implemented for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in Parliament for more than two years," lamented Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and by the end of August it should be given a new chairman who, according to AFP, is close to the opposition.
The law abolishing the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current president Michelle Bacheloret, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would attack the law in court because, according to her, it violates the right of an unborn child to live.
Members of the vote on the bill postponed last month until it was analysed by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, Members approved the proposal and did so again after them.
According to the new legislative regulation, abortion should cease to be punishable in three cases: if a woman's life is threatened, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy has resulted from rape.
Similar exceptions existed, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, in Chile since 1931, even before women were given the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortion in 1989 was introduced by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortion.
Others include Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta, and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to 30 years of prison time for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion that the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Liberty
The critique of the statue is an unmistakable sign of regime change.
Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else - see carefully staged overthrow of the statue of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, surely knew what was coming when he set off with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the President's proposals to drastically limit legal immigrants.
It's fair to say Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller reprimanded Acosta by saying: “I don’t want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the world.
The poem, which was placed on the pedestal additionally, and which you refer to, is not part of it."
Miller's really right, but as he said, this isn't about history.
These are mainly the striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - inviting them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let me see who goes down, who is poor, who is barely allowed to breathe freely, who is a miserable worm in the midst of cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better watch these "poor worms" on our screens than ever.
Miller was not trying to criticise poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the importance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends, who, after her death, sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the pedestal of the statue, knew well enough that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the connection between the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
He also has a very different name: Mother of exiles.
Merging a poem with a woman's imagination is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
The famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jan Baptizer in Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not actually invite anyone into the country, but represented early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
He brings out a torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States."
Oddly enough, Limbaugh is referring to an important point.
The meaning of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the point of view of a exhausted and damned passenger who often comes to a new country after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean with hope in his heart.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance at a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championship 2017: Neil Black sings praise for Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the United Kingdom's Athletic Federation, Neil Black, said that a strong team of 16 Scots on the World Championship team would be a "great asset to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the World Championships in London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that something strange is happening in Scotland, and British athletics could learn much from the Scots.
"We are trying to understand it and adapt - we will work on it," said Black.
“I talked to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
That's what people on the streets think.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“A few athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of great pride and motivation.
The passion and unhidden feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist of Commonwealth, who will compete in the run over the obstacles at 400 m at her fifth World Cup, said that it was "unbelievable", that there are 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
In the last year alone, the cross-country runner Muirová has set five British and two European records.
On the MS will participate in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the track at 1500 m. This season he won the British team races and annual games.
Doyle remembers her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
The team’s captain led her to be “very proud” of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues got on the team, but in many cases they will also attack the finals and medals.
“The extraordinary thing about being captain of the team is that I was elected by the other team members. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by team members is all about it gratifying,” she added.
“I am obviously very proud of all the Scots that made the team.
It proves where we've moved to.
They're athletes who will think of the front seats on stage.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think it worked.
I only pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of domestic fans and enjoy the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race, and I'm going to enjoy an incredible atmosphere."
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Do not apply for public office unless you can tolerate voters’ criticism
Our father knew of his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not take long to criticize him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he wasn't trying to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away from us - and stupid and dumb will be led as sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Union for Civil Liberties for these crimes.
The governor's staff dismissed the suit as for no reason, and many "who cares" opinions appeared in the comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is an extremely popular Republican governor.
He can boast of the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not irritating.
It is obvious that the state governs with certainty its own and strictly adheres to the principles.
It turned out that he was also skilled in using Facebook as the main means of communication with his constituents - the exception is not even the publication of the first photograph with a bare head after receiving chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, marked official and managed by his employees paid out of taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for Washington Post Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor from blocking the comments from the position of moderating the posts.
But using an image of Internet trolls, spampers, or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed a few real people whose donations were deleted.
That is exactly what they are - real people who speak to their elected leaders; teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, no trolls.
As they all said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely remarked that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the Washington Post daily comment section.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are labeled as promoting so-called collective efforts instead of being recognised as a larger group of citizens involved."
What the governor's staff called "focused spam interest," others would probably call "defence."
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage the posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for denigrating Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born in Virginia last week.
According to District Judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment in Alexandria, where it prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook site.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received visits from ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington's time, the low shipping price had virtually the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and many anonymous writers questioned its position as leader.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people in the framework of the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions in his office were gathering to criticise his position on the Deal of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he didn't shut them up.
Freedom of expression, dissent and intimidation lie in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they are in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holiday, they have more time to browse the web, and under the umbrella they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is what the typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
This results from the recent statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available within the flat rate than at home.
It is therefore no wonder that in Croatia, where the minimum of our citizens go during the winter, data consumption increased even 50 times this summer.
Italy then ranked second in the ranking of the data consumed.
Most minutes the Czechs will call from Germany, where many go during the summer.
According to the data of the Association of Czech Travel Agents, Croatia visits 800 000 Czechs annually, making it our most popular holiday destination.
But people here traded the book for sharing experiences with a mobile phone.
The record was this July 7th.
"Tens of millions of photographs would fit into the transferred data," Silvia Cieslarová, director of the mobile segment, explained.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is located in neighbouring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is only fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and an active holiday, for which we do not have that much time to browse on the Internet.
"Moreover Austria, the Czechs are heading towards the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While the operator recorded high year-on-year growth in data following the release of roaming charges, the growth is much lower for telephony.
The number of minutes allowed in roaming increased to double last year.
With a huge lead over other countries, Germany dominates.
"The roaming calls are more used by business customers on business trips," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a homely atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Over the next three days, former golf leader Ronan Rafferty will hope for a relaxing atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administration area of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, from Northern Ireland, last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals, succumbed to Paul Eales. This year he will play the role of ambassador of the tournament on behalf of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow up before my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“The players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a keen advocate of this game and he's proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
The Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite winning the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I have a good feeling about this," said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have a chance to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament was cancelled a year after my victory.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year when my wife Sharon and I won meant a lot.
It was a beautiful time I'll never forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, returns to home after celebrating 50 years from this year's region.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said about Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed and feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I think I'm doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far."
The three players will also be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of the Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free of charge. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be dedicated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Land of Gold in Indonesia
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, it rarely uses a pelvis.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital city of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the speech of the local "note" - into the fire.
After half an hour, he removes the potato and tastes it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room with no roof is cleaning the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late at night poses a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"No one dares to wander around the village this afternoon after 5:00," says Bardina.
It is a rare view of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of public upheaval before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Yakart government, which ruled the entire region except foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and ravaged city that you can reach after a 90-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach gripping with a ride.
Mass transportation isn't working in this place.
The town with 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of wool sheets in shades of grey and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners, have looked at this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, the locals worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-knit turban, dark T-shirt and shiny skirt.
"We used to only carry leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy are one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is the land of gold in Indonesia.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoeenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, home to some 153 000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports logging at an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the mighty Indonesian army to the Papuans.
An investigation conducted in 2005 by the New York Times shows that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
The Papuans calling for self - control threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
The mass murders in the Papua tribal area during the 1970 ’ s were compared to genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission said.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, the 2016 report of the Brisbanese Archdiocese, describes the atrocities that occurred last year, as out-of-court executions, torture - according to another report, particularly popular is the violence and electrocution - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The fact that Papuan resources attract colonists to Indonesia made the situation worse.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% claim Christianity, but demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatry and Sulawesi.
Javanian canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
The locals are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the capital of Jayapura Province.
"The original inhabitants of Papua Mama-mama have lost their jobs."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, known as Jokowi, promised in his presidential campaign in 2014 to address inequality and violations of rights.
Former carpenter secured and his journey to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would answer our call for justice," said You.
The fact is that only two months after the inauguration of Jakowi in October, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the night on motorbikes.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was this reproach and tone, which she had touched and later returned with four other soldiers, said the local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a drunken state were chasing a group of children and beating them with the stocking of their weapons, making sacrifices and witnesses of events.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned down the electoral commission building nearby, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came up with ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - in which they run in circles and imitate the singing of birds - the Papan Mee Pago tribe.
Several Protestants began to throw stones at buildings.
With increasing tension, the troops were given an order over the radio: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot," according to the weekly TIME, in an official document whose content has never been published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the imminent danger and invited residents to break up in their homes.
But no one had heeded his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," TIME said on the porch of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people everywhere and a lot of shootings were done," he added.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, one of the local residents, Alfie Youw, was hit three times.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him," said the weekly TIME with the gloomy voice of Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told journalists that his officers had only "secured" the station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people are threatening us with death," said Pudjo Sulistiya, press spokesperson for the Papua Police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters have been killed and many have escaped injuries.
The murder report went through the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the victims’ families and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that he would implement an out-of-court mechanism to resolve past acts of violence.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to be heard.
“Most violent acts took place a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990’s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
In an interview from June 5 for the weekly TIME, which took place in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he was not planning to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will be brought before the court".
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said that 11 human rights violations in Papua have been settled so far, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the shooting victims in Paniai welcomed his claims of distrust.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but I haven't seen anything yet," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he claims.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many inhabitants of Paniai who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to his words, he was beaten up by members of the military after helping bury four of the victims.
"After the burial of the bodies, the army began to seek me," he said.
And the shooting isn't stopping.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The struggle, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing stones at the residents, and the answers were warning shots fired.
However, locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitarist police) began shooting into the crowd and killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation," said 29-year-old Domingga Badia, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the wounded arrive.
"I haven't left the house in two days."
The Deiyai Parliament demanded the punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous peoples of Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal, who live in central highlands.
Many of them joined the Liberation Movement of Papua (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and abducting Indonesian policemen.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai. They are not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai people in recent years, all under the pretext of "assurance of national sovereignty".
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as a "tragic and forgotten place".
The oil pours poverty into the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And the bread is still unattainable.
Locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire has opened more routes and new immigrants have begun to flow into the country, economic inequality has increased between native Papuars and immigrants.
So few jobs will usually be occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to get into business.
"Young people move out of villages due to lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua France because of a “lack of cooperation with the authorities,” despite the fact that they were given such a rare permission to film.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the most rebellious eastern areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said.
The lack of reports from per foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia on Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - ran the UN Human Rights Council on investigations into various and widespread acts of violence in Papua, including shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmanath Nasir, dropped the charges by telling journalists in Jakarta that: “The democratic system is still in force in Indonesia and the media are free, so it is difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals are calling for foreign governments to participate.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, the local people cried out according to a source that also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the motto “We want freedom.”
More elections are scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but the Papuans say they won't vote for Jokowi.
"Yokowi is a man with good intentions, but is surrounded by people involved in shooting in Paniai," Gobau, Chairman of the Tribal Council, said.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - apart from living in constant fear of a robbery army - are lying in poverty, poor education, and a health system.
Gobai claims that the people of Paniai, like the other Papuans, consider their vote to be a “debt” that Jokowi must repay.
"They do not want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the families of the victims of the paniaic shooting, they continue in the last symbolic act of resistance: burying the victims' bodies on the property across from the police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least they won't let responsible people forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy picked up a huge shipment of cocaine in Australia.
The French navy intercepted a $1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million in a Pacific yacht.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
During the intervention, four-member crews of the ship were arrested, probably made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was dragged by police to a port in Nouméa, a metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence agency said that, in cooperation with its international partners, it would seek to pinpoint exactly where and where the drugs were headed and to reveal the 'Lithuania Syndicate'.
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures they have taken to stop large quantities of drugs going to Australia," said Col Blanche, Executive Director.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street drug prices.
The country is also facing the problem of increasing numbers of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current bust is not the first one in recent times.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
This could be a problem in elderly homes, according to a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová could be an infusion of saline, which is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
They're only applied in medical facilities.
The older you get, the more water in your body drops.
"In addition, they lose the feeling of thirst, so the elderly generally receive less fluids and are dehydrated very quickly," Mádlová said.
They should drink two grand for sure.
"But getting so many fluids into an old man is a big problem," she added.
In elderly homes, she often thinks that no doctor is watching over it.
In hospitals, they usually treat dehydration with infusions.
"I think that even there should be gradually introduced so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two bottles of saline can be delivered to the elderly in a day.
Lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking confused," she said.
In the event of neglect, it may result in a stroke.
Blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, and there's also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, maximum cotton sheets.
One-off diapers may also be a problem.
"It is more demanding, but it would be ideal to expose the patient occasionally and let the skin air out," said the doctor.
The Torch skyscraper burned for the second time in Dubai
One of the world’s largest residential skyscrapers was on fire in Dubai on Friday. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents of 337 meters high and 79 storey buildings.
In the last two years, this is the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the fitting name The Torch.
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries.
“We were asleep and woke up by the alarm. We heard screaming.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the inhabitants of the skyscraper.
The Dubai Civil Defense reported that the firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4:00 a.m. (0:00 GMT), then continued cooling the building.
Government officials have added that they provide substitute accommodation for disabled people.
Once again, the incident could provoke discussion on the safety of materials used to lining high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation which initiated the management of the Torch skyscraper following the fire in 2015 revealed that the most damaged linings and external panels used for decoration or insulation were the most damaged.
The British police reported that the isolation and lining system of the London Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in the June fire, which killed nearly 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five passengers to the U.S. were carrying prohibited items on board the aircraft.
A survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent of them consciously or unconsciously passed prohibited objects through the checkpoints of the U.S. government agency Transportation Security Administration on board the plane. At least six percent of them boarded a plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have been delayed to discover that they were traveling with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The results of the survey carried out by the airline Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - to which more than 1000 respondents responded - showed that younger passengers are more likely to be in breach of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to travel with an object prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand flying hours were compared to less than 15 percent of the members of Generation X.
Food and alcohol are among the most common items that have escaped TSA attention.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly spoke a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they deliberately passed illegal drugs on board the aircraft.
The company stated that it was doing research between passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally carried out unauthorized items through airport control and how many did so on purpose.
It is no surprise that most people who have transferred unauthorized objects - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel very often by plane.
As the company pointed out, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what fluids and how much they can carry on the plane.
It is not surprising, then, that TSA seized the most of the currently banned liquid.
For a time, people thought that TSA would handle books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Liquid transport is permitted within domestic flights, not international ones.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on the postponement of the planned guidelines for reducing the emissions of the Obama administration
After fifteen states were sued by the Environmental Protection Agency, her boss Scott Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the plan of the former Obama administration to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes in his plan, thus reacting more rapidly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal appeal filed against his previous position at the federal appeal court.
This concerns the last deadline set for 1 October, when States should start to comply with the 2015 Regulation for reducing the quantity of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interventions with local decisions or impending economic growth.”
Pruitt, who served as State Attorney General of Oklahoma prior to being the head of the EPA, served for a long time as a reliable opposer of stricter environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly shifted or delayed the regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
A sudden Wednesday turnover is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the federal appeal court in Washington ruled that the EPA executor exceeded his authority in order to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane spills.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened CEPOL's commitment to cooperation with states through complex processes and compliance with new standards within a given timeframe.
"During the reign of the previous EPA administration, she often did not meet the deadlines and waited for her to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing with the settlement and further setting of plans," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen claims at the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and authority that comes from it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt can use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities” at a certain point to ensure that regulations are “based on sound policy and the most accessible information”.
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more extensive transcription of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone implementation of the rules from 2015 for at least eight years.
The measure still failed the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that were suing the EPA this week, said that the group was not going to allow legal pressure.
"The turnaround in the views of EPA - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-floor ozone is created when normal harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in an atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists acknowledge Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
"It is worrying what kind of pressure it takes to change the minds of responsible people and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to struggle with the ideological campaign of Trump's administration, which seeks to aid polluters and special interests."
He spilled acid on a man, yet he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what could happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family and you laugh, the next, your whole life changes from the ground up.
And worst of all, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate was met by Andreas Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was flattened by the acid of an unknown attacker, who was eventually acquitted.
The website Reuters reported the information.
In December 2014, someone knocked on Christopheros' door.
Andreas got up to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents to the family that day.
Instead, he had a cruel surprise waiting for him.
The man he'd never seen in his life, he spilled acid on him without warning, saying, "That's for you, buddy."
The pain was indescribable.
My clothes fell apart on me like nothing, and all I felt was incredible skin pain," Andreas said.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but his loved ones learned a terrible message - according to the doctors, he had no chance of surviving.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face was affected, which doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
A major complication became a loss of eyelids for Christopheros.
It's probably the most tortured thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described.
Today Christopheros has completed 12 operations that are far from the last.
According to plastic surgeons, the injuries that victims suffer from acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have scarred tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight deformity and deformity all their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed that he was taking revenge on a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the case properly and then tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict to the amazement of Christopher’s family changed fundamentally.
"The three judges finally concluded that the sentence should be lifted, because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the last few years, the numbers of corrosives have increased considerably.
The Home Office expressed its views on the issue by planning to lay down new guidelines for prosecutors on the classification of corrosives.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
But victims of similar attacks are not about to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer prison sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require stricter controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in various stores, as they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai was burned at night by the famous skyscraper The Torch, one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai civil defense, the inhabitants of the 80-story building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for the Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upward.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the other way around.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the highest floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We were sleeping.
The alarm woke us up, people screamed.
"We went down the stairs, took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said the tenant George.
Another of CNN’s witnesses estimated that about 40 apartments had caught fire.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, according to the civil defense communication, the fire was managed to get under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the power went out.
The extensive fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over 100 flats.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, no one was harmed, as the residents were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became the world’s tallest residential building with its 352 metres.
Another Dubai skyscraper robbed him of his record the next year.
A bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substance in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a variety of illicit drugs - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson’s disease or anorexia - were found in a sample of 23 - year - old Ippolito.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him with his title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is facing a four-year distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugbista David Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which until then was a record number for caught athletes.
According to his words, a third-league player started taking steroids the year before he failed bodybuilding.
Lucy Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugging an ex-lover!
Just as Lucka Vondráčková has entered the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And it also attracts attention wherever it goes.
Last time she fell into her arms was her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older then and longed for family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly did not want to hang up her career.
So they separated, but they remained friends to this day.
They also proved this at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both blended in blue.
At first they ignored each other, but then they became close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's pranks until she fell behind her belly.
Then they hugged and willingly posed for the photographers.
However, their meeting was not an accident, because they will be playing a couple of lovers in the new series Primy Captain Exner.
The Islamists got life in the UK for preparing an assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of an Islamist cell called Three Musketeers to prison for life, and according to the D.A., she was planning a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had been convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities at the time thought he was about to attack immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "unbelieving" in Arabic, and a gun pattern.
It happened the moment an MI5 intelligence agent placed a listening device in the vehicle.
"The recent assassinations have shown the horror the defendants could have caused if they were not stopped," said Prosecutor's Attorney General Sue Hemming.
Three convicts aged 28, 25, and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years in prison.
During the London trial, the men claimed that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also questioned him, but then rejected the defendants' claim.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
At Hodoninsk they measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Fahrenheit remained at the top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in Strážnice in Hodonínsk, he surpassed it on Thursday, which has thus far become the hottest day of this year.
This was confirmed by the employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday, however, many temperature records did not fall on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records for 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years were broken or evened.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
In Strážnice, for example, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice in Břeclavsko on Thursday 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of degrees and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
In the west, it was ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice it was the hottest in Dyyákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclavsk, where mercury reached 37.8 degrees but did not beat the record.
On the other hand, according to the ČHMÚ website, for example in western and northwest Bohemia, the highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsius on Thursday.
"The temperatures only started to grow there later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade, according to ČHMÚ and on Sunday there could be even more significant rains.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia as well as on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions on visa policy.
For decades, China has tried to exert its influence without the use of force.
Each year, they spend $10 billion to support language schools and build universities abroad, push their entertainment industry to foreign markets, and try to attract Western tourists.
Well, that's not a good thing for Beijing.
The state media there are talking about a plan to turn tourism into a driving force for economic transformation and modernisation.
Last year, however, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent and about 80 percent of tourists came to China from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, the situation in the world’s most populous country is assessed by Professor of Economics from Beijing University Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
The example that speaks for itself is China’s visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free relations with China, while the citizens of the rest have to deal with the visa in advance.
At Chinese offices in the US, therefore, crowds are comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait in line for long hours, you have to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic obstacles.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for visas reduces the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and has less than one percent of the population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens the problem itself by using tourism to realise its political objectives, such as in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China cut back on transportation to South Korea in the spring as part of a riot about the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans retaliated and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year on year, while Japan grew by 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the Fed’s US central bank, China could have left as much as $190 billion as China’s foreign travels, while China receives some $35 billion a year as a result of selling currency to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China’s entire surplus in the goods trade.
A small number of tourists, therefore, strike a very painful blow to a country that is anxiously hindering the capital drain.
However, the factors mentioned above are only one sign of more general restraint toward foreigners.
In many places of China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, fewer than a million foreigners lived throughout China.
Some cities have more in the United States.
Japan, which is not exactly the crossroads of immigration, has twice as much.
Many scientific work shows that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
In China, however, you will not find them.
It will be politically challenging to solve these problems, but the step that is being taken is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, especially India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and make visa procedures cheaper.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen Zoo, mortally poisonous reptiles were multiplied.
The Pilsner Kingdom of poison can enjoy three rare, deadly reptiles.
At the exhibition visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish vipers.
This species lives in northern Anatoli, even at an altitude of 2,000 metres.
"It grows even three feet long," said Martin Vobruba, spokesperson for the zoo.
The young of the other two species, mortals and cobras red, meanwhile, will gain strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We would not like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying that it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian vipers came into the world, the offspring of a breeding couple native to the Sydney population.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition is one of the mortals around Perth," Vobruba said, adding that in human care, 6-8 weeks of winter at 13 degrees Celsius is necessary for mortals.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a bunch of African spitting cobras red.
A total of four chicks hatched from four eggs in the Pilsen Zoo.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to a distance of four meters.
It's aimed at the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feed on mouse sticks in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden they expect to hatch young from a pack of mamba black, eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of a phone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a phone conversation on January 27 with Mexican President Enrique Peña Niet, Trump directed him to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The US president blamed him for publicly condemning the building of a wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press."
Trump, as part of his campaign, promised to build a wall along the southern border and announced that Mexico would pay for it.
He also leaked the transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. refugee surveillance agreement going to Australia was "stupid" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came about under President Obama - he would look like "drugd" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the US.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day".
Tusk testified again at the D.A.'s office for Smolensk.
"He has nothing to worry about," said Tusk's brother, dead president, Chairman of the Government Party Law and Justice PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk replied and said to the country's current leadership that they are trying to exploit justice against political rivals.
On leaving the D.A.'s mansion, according to TVN 24 TV, a crowd was waiting for Tusk, who chanted Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a hundred years!.
Tusk thanked for his support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me."
He does not blame the prosecutors, but he does not doubt that justice is to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against opponents, opposition or people they do not like, and I fear I belong to this group.
He's been in interrogation for the second time.
The exhibitor has been questioned in the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time he should have been questioned about the misconduct in the autopsy of victims of the Smolen disaster.
In addition, it was found to replace the bodies in the coffins.
Families were banned from opening coffins, and there had to be some reason.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU," said Kaczyński on Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would frustrate Tusk's chances of obtaining the most important seat in the Union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also stated that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take note of it.
Tusk had an eight-hour hearing at the D.A.'s office on April 19th.
Even then, he didn't testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his subpoenas for questioning considered it part of the obvious effort of the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
The D.A. is subordinated in Poland to the Minister of Justice, who acts as Attorney General.
The summons for questioning came soon after Tusk was elected head of the European Council, to whom Kaczyński worked hard but tried in vain to prevent, among other things, the visit of Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone against the extension of Tusk's mandate.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It comes from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update, and is currently in a comment procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry explains.
"In some countries new representative offices have been established, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has been changed," it says.
The Decree contains two annexes, the first of which is indicated by the representative offices to which paper ballots are supplied.
This group of authorities includes representations of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the print version.
They're changing the list with the decree.
Four years ago, the Czechs could vote at, for example, the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also abolished its representation in Bamako and Kyoto, Malaysia.
There will be no election at the General Consulate in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in the east of Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Nairobi, the Senegalese capital of Dakar, and Lusace, Zambia.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has extended its representation by the General Consulate in Iraq's Irbil and Cheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan.
The ballots will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to select members in polls at representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the state electoral committee shall determine by lot the region for whose candidates are voted abroad.
This was the first time in 2002 when it was decided among South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among South Bohemia’s candidates.
In 2013 the Central Bohemian Region was chosen as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is increasing steadily.
During the premiere 15 years ago, some 3800 people came to vote; in 2006, there were around 6700, four years later 8222.
Ten,571 voters came to the early parliamentary elections four years ago.
Massacre on Moore's Ford Bridge: Activists recalled racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed by the bystanders of Monroe, Georgia, and squirmed toward the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - dragged himself out of a cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want this n-and Roger!" shouted the man.
"Bring it to me!"
The silence stops the roar of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is a mere reconstruction of events that occurred on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a noose over "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a regular group of activists have been returning to the Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one's ever been tried for murder.
"It is a wonder that in all these years no one has been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the reconstruction of the events, was heard.
"It is a stain on our history and a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia Congressman and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic call for action. Every year the Monroe community reminds that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice first," Brooks said.
"In the meantime, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated."
The M.E. is covering one of the victims of the lynching at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI files received by NBC News intelligence, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts were to participate in the lynching.
But no one has ever been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that suspects remain free for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the citizens of the city.
In April 1946, by decision of the Supreme Court, the black people of Georgia were granted the right to participate in elections scheduled for the summer for the first time.
And it was during the summer election that, according to the FBI, a black farmer, Roger Malcom, during a skirmish, was supposed to stab the owner of Barnett Hester's white land, supposedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, hester's been hanging out with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and he's got her pregnant.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a major white land owner, posted a $600 bail for Malcolm.
Dorothy and his cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to the prison.
On their return from prison, just before entering Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turned out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison," the FBI concluded.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement officers who not only participated in the lynching but also got rid of the evidence and covered up the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks was more brief on the matter.
"It was a massacre because of the right to vote," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all local black people: 'This is how you will end up if you register and vote'."
The annual reconstruction of the Moore's Ford Bridge is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost a decade.
Her performance is figurative, captivating, and apt, showing deep-rooted racism, which many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy, and it's even more difficult to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hidden in each of us," Greene said.
"But there cannot be a relationship between us unless you hear what I have been through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen white people, the rest of the black people - rolled up into a room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is acting as assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but according to his words the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about this because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, or Barnett Hester, practice their roles.
The show begins with a fight - Malcom is arguing with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property n-e!"
Rascona can't be done.
There's been a struggle.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asks Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene answers cheerfully.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'n-r' in that tone."
"Exactly," one of the black actors blurts out.
"You need to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of bonding.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to be done behind enough of the four victims of the massacre.
Actors repeat the scene.
This time Rascona emphasizes the correct expression of the word on the N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Scream, gunshots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of actors and sings the grieving song of Billie Holiday "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there's sadness in the room.
On the background of all this, about a dozen bystanders wipe the sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience has virtually the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple came all the way from New York Ithaca, many bystanders from nearby.
Each of them tolerates the local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks in the crowd leads them to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up until now, the murders could have been watched from a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is frightening.
With the last words of the song, Greene will call on a crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel at the heads of the victims, watching false blood and motionless bodies and whispering in their ears.
"They're not dead," a little boy says.
A few minutes go by, and Greene's gonna thank the audience.
Actors clean up the rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two actors and weeps in their arms; eventually he gets emotional.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
“We know you hate the role.
But you had a reason."
Later that same day, the audience and the actors sit down for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are talking about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words to express her feelings about tonight's performance.
"It is difficult to listen to the ugly words and look at the hideous deeds... that people do that look like you and do that because they look like you," she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical topic," she added, "just called police brawls."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in a courtroom, enjoying dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already started planning the show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think about it," he said.
“If we don’t learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love instructions for use.
A friend of mine says he only reads instructions for use by a coward.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember a long time ago, where the instructions for using anything were rather a rare phenomenon.
So for example, my first gramophone contained only one piece of paper that had hieroglyphics depicting the connection of parts, all of which had some secret markings.
Years later, when something went wrong inside me, I offered the charter to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back plate.
He told me with a smirk what the labyrinth paper was good for.
Yes, it was a used tool in chronic toilet paper depletion.
Playfully, he found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl badges again.
New times have brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruitjuicer, where he simply stuck to the chopped grapefruit, required about ten pictures.
A sketch with a description of how to insert parts into each other was particularly good.
The set was two-piece and another procedure was simply not possible.
Putting it in reverse took considerable effort to break down certain plastic parts.
My contempt for instructions ended with my seat Leon self-propelled.
The year of production 2003 still had such a book with instructions for small repairs, which included, among other things, changing the light bulb.
It was easy.
Three steps in total, and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author failed to mention that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
One, take out the cover.
2. Unscrew the cracked bulb and screw the new one.
3. Slide the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem placing the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the upper right limb into the interior of the car I would pick up some spring, screw, by which the cover was easily removed and then I would follow the points of 1-3 of the energy saving author of the service book.
It's a footbridge error.
The shelter had no place, no space for a slender hand of Cinderella, let alone an obese Slezano.
I've lost half an hour of my life without any success.
The condition was heightened by the entrance of my wife into the garage, which was called by the ryrk and words which hear from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked unwittingly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I miss vulgar terms, there are only two publishable words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she risked a sentence that could be her last in a long-term union.
I slowly explained the problem to her, and I put the main emphasis on the path of the author of the manual, where blessing with hot iron on the hand, which she wrote, then by its apparition, so that he could never write anything again, was just an introduction to a wide range of manuals of Hammer for Witches, including his commissional burning at the top of the Losin Castle.
"Why don't we remove the box?" The woman meant to remove the battery.
In pure despair it happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just coming out of a breakdown post-check by two officers of the State Department of Drug Control.
I know him as a colleague of the balanced, who has experienced both possible and impossible in the field and who can tell wild stories with an unrelenting voice.
"Imagine that I was fined for not having a handwashing manual," he told me in a weak voice.
I gradually got the whole problem out of him, which was that he did not have picture instructions on how to wash his hands above the sink in the toilet of the patients.
His argument by the Commissioner that adults usually know how to wash their hands and that it does not take pictograms to cope with the usual activity of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that a simple washing of washed palms with running water is a primitive act at the level of the crocoon, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
It must be said that water must be released from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end there is a joyous finding that you washed your hands exactly as ordered by the SÚKL hostar.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for toilet activity.
On the question of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, in urination, due to certain differences in both sexes, it will be necessary to post instructions two.
The problem remains those pictograms, because creating a perfect procedure means an accurate drawing of all the anatomical details, which could arouse some outrage in the prude's toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that throughout his life he has wiped the opening completely wrong.
Pearson will release another 3000 employees and reduce the dividend in an attempt to revive trade
On Friday, the British education group Pearson stated that it would release another 3000 employees and reduce the interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which, according to the Executive Director John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, is followed by the company’s previous decision to release 4000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by another £300 million ($394 million) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in order to revive declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
Last month, the company that agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann stated that the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a 1% increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
An attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. One NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were injured, reported by official officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, mentioned in NATO's statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians died during the attack in Qarabagh County.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bombing - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at the Herat Mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that Tuesday's explosion occurred after the patrol and members of the Afghan army were attacked by a "local person with a homemade explosive device".
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of harm's way and are in an American military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is an important source of concern from NATO Allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Kabul district of Shia.
The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31st, more than 150 people were killed by a large explosion in the city centre, the most deadly militant attack in the country since the U.S. forces overthrown the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence undermines the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to assist military troops and police in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks to which the public’s confidence in the government, its regulations, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin, have shaken up the attacks on schooling in recent weeks.
In response to the action, the EPA reconsidered its decision to postpone smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency withdrew its decision to postpone the Obama administration law, which ordered states to reduce emissions, only one day after 15 states sued the Agency.
CEPOL announced on Wednesday night its decision to refer the “Ozone Standards 2015” to the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will hear their views," said the CEO of EPA Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's efforts to delay ozone standards - which measure real air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, set limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 of most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed an action on Tuesday, arguing that the EPA's conduct is illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to avoid the many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words, in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government’s efforts have launched countermeasures by democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA reports on its website that Ozone-containing breathing “may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, ” such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár got hit and blood flowed!
You may have already registered this quite new singer with us in June this year, when this almost unknown singer in our country organized a monstrous event at Czech conditions, where he hosted such prominent personalities as Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was not hosted by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show myself to the public and to present your music video to Sara, whose baptism was hosted by just-named personalities.
Few who already know that the recording itself, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet, and it didn't go without a proper embarrassment.
Sara's song is very emotional and based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, the singer's rival should have indicated a slap in the music video.
At one point, however, he struck him so hard and straight up the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I did not expect it, my nose immediately started to bleed," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said it was an accident and Ladislav did not have time to react.
Fortunately, the injury wasn't serious enough to affect the continuation of the next shooting.
We now bring you the young artist's music video, you can also record the scene with a punch.
The bad version with the blood, however, was rather not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match, met for the first time at a Tuesday's meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated Lightweight Champion World Boxing Council - did not come down to the hall where he welcomed Lomačenka, the Cockweight Champion World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's showtime game, both boxers made it to the list of the top five easyweight boxers.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 7:00 p.m.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomakenko Egis Klimas adds that the potential fight of boxers would be a "perfect test".
"I'm a former cockweight champion," Garcia adds.
“Because of the fight with Broner (67 kg) I had to gain weight, but I’m not that big.
I'm small at my 63 kilos.
I'd like to go back to the lightweight category.
He'll have to put on more weight to get on lightly... then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why don't we do that to them."
Squirrel's a match.
"The box would be good for this game."
Klimas made a request to pay for the viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomačenko should complete his lightweight debut at the end of this year and next year to compete with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete for the lightweight title in the Forum arena on 23 September.
"The match should be a viewing payment, that's what the fans want," said Garcia, who later said that the possibility of broadcasting the match is open through a television station that comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw that kind of attention.
Let's wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as a "awesome boxer" and could participate in his Saturday game.
But you couldn't lull Garcia's praise when he said that the Riverside three division champion looked "very slow... sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said that his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
Both boxers said they felt an increasing tension before each other's duel.
“You can’t forget this game.
There's no other match that attracts so much attention.
And I will put a great deal of pleasure on the fire," said Garcia.
He said: “I was waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey. ”
It's gonna be a great game."
A young couple disappeared 12 years ago without a trace.
They found their car at the bottom of the Volga.
A couple of young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Cherkasova have been missing since December 2005.
There's been an extensive search for them, but no success.
And in the end, in the absence of evidence, the police terminated the investigation.
The lost couple's families lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, there was a sad ending to the whole story.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the river Volha in Čeboksary, Čuvašsk.
Thanks to the documents that were left in the car, the police managed to identify a few.
The documents survived under water for a decade, without them it would take the police much longer to identify the victims.
A couple were last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
So far, the diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his discovery to the Cheboksar police, who dragged the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frozen journey along the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its termination.
Recent test results for setting the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of tests by asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people have been surveyed as older than 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensicverket started new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the context of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for the failure to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has handed over 6880 cases to investigate, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) was assessed as over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the question was "maybe over 18 years of age".
In other 423 cases, it was decided that the question was "perhaps under 18".
The tests shall only be taken if the age of the person in question is disputed.
According to Johan Gìransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond with the previous month.
"Compared to the last month, the statistics stick to the track and the numbers are very similar," he said to The Local.
An increased number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that "the person concerned is 18 years or older".
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the surveyed man stated that he would be 18 years old this year.
Criticism was also given to a medical method of determining age, which includes an x-ray of wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who is involved, among other things, in assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person underwent puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I do not think that these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can't determine age with precision, we shouldn't pretend otherwise," Metro said.
The forensic medical agency Agency, Agency's GÃ¡ransson, defended the decision by saying: “In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person in question is just below the limit of 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all those in question."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
US President Donald Trump, in a phone call in January to Mexican President Enrique Peño Niet, threatened not to meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that financing would be arranged somehow, even if he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It follows from the transcripts of the interviews published by the American daily The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after Trump Peñu Nieto took office, he reproved non-diplomatically for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't tell the press that," said Trump repeatedly in an interview on January 27, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continues to make defiant statements.
They say the funding will work out, and eventually it'll work out.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," according to the American daily Trump.
He called the wall the least important thing we're talking about, but he may be politically the most important thing.
The executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of a wall of 3200 kilometres, which is why the relations of both countries have escalated.
At the end of March Trump said that the project would still be valid for the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported Trump's telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
He was moved to this conclusion by an exchange of views on an agreement whereby Australia would provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States’ acceptance of persons from internment facilities in Pacific island states.
Trump thought the deal was stupid at first, but later he agreed to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the agreement you have created, but you will have to stick to it," he told Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump appreciated it as a good idea for Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
But suddenly the tone of the conversation got heated.
"I hate the reception of these people," said Trump.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They will not be great people who will go to work for local milkers," he said.
In an interview, he also noted that a fugitive could become a Boston bomber in five years' time.
Trump had telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House, often several during one day.
In the end, he called Turnbull the least pleasant one all day.
Before he finished, he pointed out that he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed Rana's killer in front of the crowd.
Her father stood by.
The execution took place in the square in Yemenu Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose as his victim the little Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Magrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
Then he raped her body, which he then threw near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl has struck an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-headed crowd that met to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
After the execution, the victim's father shared his feelings with the media.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
The other members of the family were also present, together with the crowd shouting the word "let justice live".
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was taken.
The police put him tied up on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his gun against him and fired fire at close range.
The crowd here celebrated every blow that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia have prevailed," he added.
I was standing on the Square of Liberation in Sana awaiting the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hateful madness, grab and lynch the killer.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Hútí.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes after the arrest, but his act provoked such outrage that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, they discovered evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
An animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that ran Ran's body was terrible," he told the media.
"The morning disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her picture hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer's parents who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out and play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was being held and to demand immediate punishment.
A D.O.D. rep read the current crowd a record of the investigation to calm them down.
Apparently, the accused did not show remorse over his actions.
Just before his sentence was served, the police read him the sentence, but the convicted one looked at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but many records were posted online by the crowd.
The governor of West Virginia announced the change of political party
Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced Thursday night at President Trump's assembly that he was crossing over to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," said the Governor of Justice.
"Today, after a long prayer and reflection... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I tell you that I can no longer support you as a democratic governor."
The crowd of bystanders exploded in joy.
"Tomorrow I will join the Republicans," added Justice.
"As coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had already promised people an important announcement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited large property from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: “The defection of Governor Justice is another blow for the democratic party, which puts obstacles in our way instead of making our country lift up.”
"For the democratic party, which has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is the last straw for an already miserable party without a leader who is in vain seeking to find a positive and unifying report," said President RNC Ronna McDaniel in her statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "honest" apology for the doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the right time to return Russia to the sports world.
The head of Russian athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championships in athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way. ”
Despite his comments, IAAF Congress members voted in favour of maintaining the ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report showed that Russia was supporting doping its athletes.
"I think we saw a very honest answer and presentation today," Sebastian Coe, President of the IAAF, told journalists.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had admitted its mistake and worked hard to correct and restore the proper function of the entire Federation."
Coe said that he was also “pleased” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been a great success and we have moved on to the next stage, but Congress supports the recommendations of the crisis crew on maintaining the sentence that was imposed on Russia," Coe added.
“In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our aim has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest ones," he finished his speech.
At the World Championships in athletics, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag, who have fulfilled the strict rules of IAAF.
The head of the IAAF Rune Andersen crisis crew said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it is admitted back.
The drug testing is still unsatisfactory and the excluded coaches continue to operate, telling reporters in London after the presentation of the IAAF Council.
The CzechTrade contract was awarded to Frantisek Savova, whose state prosecutes.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publisher Mladá fronta Frantisek Savova.
Officials awarded him 100 percent of the points in all quality criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecuted Savova for tax fraud and asked for its extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the CzechTrade Ministry of Industry and Trade's pro-export agency launched a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract with a total value of CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the publisher Mladá fronta podniker František Savov.
The Czech police charged him with tax evasion in 2014 and prosecuted him on the run.
Savov has fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is asking for its release.
News server Aktuálně.cz alerted the case.
According to the original CzechTrade criteria, the award should be decided from 60 percent of the price offered and from the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion greatly helped Savova's company.
According to Dotyk.cz, she received 100 points in all partial quality criteria.
This led her to the next candidate, the publishing house Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with the amount of CZK 404 900 per month, VLM offered CZK 324 350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it gained 62 points from the assessors in all quality criteria.
The tender was also attended by the consultancy company BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which belongs to the server Aktuálně.cz under the label Economia.
VLM has raised several objections to the result of the tender, considering its evaluation to be unfair and inadequately justified.
Following their rejection, the Commission decided to challenge competition at the Office for the Protection of Competition of the ÚOHS.
He believes that CzechTrade has acted in violation of the law.
"The proposer is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the supplier of the contract on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly favoring the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the proposer and other suppliers," says the proposal for initiating the procedure filed at ÚOHS this week, published by the server Aktuálně.
According to VLM CEO and VLM Chairman Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee seems to be an unreliable and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project among all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Each independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors unlikely and suspicious," Klíma said.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in the Contractor's Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin in accordance with the law.
"After the completion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot comment on it," the media representative of the agency Štěpán Dlouhý told Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that Economia had intervened with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it had its own business interests.
However, this was mentioned in that article.
In the tender, she could be helped by the fact that she was the one who provided the BusinessInfo editorial services in the previous four years.
The contract was first competed in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martim Kuba ODS.
Frantisek Savov is accused by police of tax evasion in connection with excessive deductions of VAT by his companies, which caused the Czech state alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO Andrej Babiš movement is behind his criminalization, under the influence of the publishing house Mafra.
Last year, the London court rejected Savov's appeal against extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved since last year, we have not received any information from the UK regarding the acquisition of the legal power of the judgment to this day," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague City Prosecutor, told news server Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was represented at Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the České Budějovice Samson Brewery, and at the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund buying endangered assets.
It should also control the failed Heavy Machinery Services company, formerly Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past Savov was also associated with the removal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker drove down the sidewalks and through the park, ended up in the crumpets.
The biker attracted attention by reckless driving on the streets, pedestrians and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to take her in the direction of the station.
"The officers of the men were cautiously chasing the city when he failed to drive on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lázně and drove his motorcycle into the field where he crashed," said police spokesperson Daniel Dvořák.
Finally, a rescue helicopter, which transported the injured biker to the hospital in Pilsen, had to come to the accident.
Then the police found out that the biker didn't own the driver's license, the motorcycle registration plates were stolen, his serial number cut and the production label itself removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breath test was carried out and the presence of alcohol at the driver's site was ruled out, but a positive result on methamphetamine was detected by the test," the police spokesperson said.
How the Financial Rules of Football Will Affect Neymar’s Transfer to Paris
The rules limiting the financing of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s record transfer from Spain’s Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The financial fair play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 state that PSG will have to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions a year.
There are several financial conditions following Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a rich Cathar family that has become rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums on buying players, but on the other hand they have to prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overheads of football-related business activities.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his appointment as UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that were in debt in search of new reinforcements were ultimately defrauding and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, FFP’s rules redirected their attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spent a lot of money on players y to build a global brand - was suddenly not so advantageous.
In the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cheferin, is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules still apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," Andrea Traverso said last week for the Associated Press, which oversees compliance with FFP rules.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neymara in a one-off payment, it may distribute the amount for accounting purposes to the full duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44,4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of the highest sanctions FFP hit in 2014 PSG together with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi Group.
The PSG suffered a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a command to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is careful about teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Cathar company sponsors the PSG once the financing exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the billing of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority of the PSG team was too high.
According to some reports, part of Neymar's income in the PSG could be reimbursed by the MS Football Organising Commission 2022 in Qatar.
However, PSG and MS 2022 representatives in Qatar denied that Neymat should become an ambassador to the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver would easily be revealed by UEFA officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's informed UEFA, there was no investigation into Neymara's transfer to the PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as it was not entitled to comment on the PSG situation, said The Associated Press.
The last published financial statements show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling jerseys.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
Spain’s league leaders, obviously concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar’s departure, arguing that PSG would violate FFP’s rules.
“This is a clear case of “financial doping” of the club and the state,” said the President of la Liga Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of PSG by the Cathar Syndicate.
Arsenal Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports tycoon, shares the same position of the La League on the financing of the club.
"It is the result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“Once the club owner becomes owner, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have various interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartan midfielder Rosick: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Thomas Rosický is going to the set.
Same scene as in the Sunday match against the Bohemians.
Spartan midfielder turned the game against Crveny Zvezda, he made several goals, but his teammates did not go into black.
The Letenian team pumped up with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements so after the opening two-game in the European Cups ends.
Was it difficult to do anything about the match after the goal of Belgrade?
After the goal was scored, four had to be scored, which was hard for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, raise our confidence, so we could bounce back to the next game.
We had a chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why hasn't Sparta been able to get into the game for so long?
The game is so worked up.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere. We fired at halftime.
Of course, that's awfully little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you have to push your opponent into such positions more often.
Is a large number of changes in the lineup a problem?
Of course, it's one of the pains of forming a new team.
We only played three competitions, and the lineup is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect 11 to sit down.
Is it encouraging that you have already played parts of two games in a row?
It's still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition will evolve and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be. There's no other way.
It's the same as the injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta decided somehow, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they left in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
Once again, there was a wonderful visit, just like with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
To do something that they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember those visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting ourselves, we're playing, so it's not such an advantage for us.
An entrepreneur should serve ten years for an extreme tax evasion.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of the businessman Jiří Toman, who is supposed to serve ten years in prison for tax cuts.
The calculated damage amounts to CZK 645 million.
In his complaint, Toman claimed that the justice had violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were said to be incomplete.
The Constitutional Judges, however, ruled the complaint unfounded, found CTK from the court database.
The ÚS is not another appeal court.
"He cannot, as the fourth instance, assess the factual or legal errors allegedly committed by the general courts if they do not constitute a breach of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time Toman was in extradition in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the decision of the ÚS.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage suffered.
The Supreme Court called the case an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
From 2005 to 2008 he worked as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Service.
The damage of CZK 645 million was created only during the period from January to July 2008, the total leak, according to the expert, exceeded a billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the prosecution, World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in mere statistics.
World Service and some of the companies with which the company was trading have a relationship with the businessman Radomír Vybír, whom the judiciary has charged for VAT machinations in fuel stores for 13 years in prison.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court some time ago.
"Summer for Survival" and "Comrade Detective" series play on a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both figures from the famous 1980s; as for dirty 1990s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced a comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and, of course, also for modern times, 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd broke into larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody as well as the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
But from the franchise's point of view, someone seems to be running out of breath.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (for example, the story of the creation of a talking can of vegetables, which H. Jon Benjamin told).
The authors deviated from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play teen horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The continuation of "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults does not push so much to the emotional level and satire is sporadic in places, including the parody of the '90s thrillers as "Hand on the cradle".
At one point the character finds on a pile of junk Apple Powerbook, roller skates and "a lot of other things from 1991".
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now the writer, is still not over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), which George H.W. Bush (a very well-occupied Michael Ian Black) encourages.
As always, many side stories are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to watch a young Rudd with long hair, aka Matt Dillon character from Youth, whose once respectable Andy character is now behind the old paprika.
Francesco could start with moments of random madness, such as the return of the Seven Up series, until it reaches what I assume will be a logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when the whole group will embark on the premiere of "Summer to Survival".
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgia: Cold War revivalism of the series "Such Normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No Regret" and even the series "GLOW", in which icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scene clash.
The comedy of creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak directed by Rhys Thomas is to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism after the way Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - tough Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, which were dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (the executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as policemen watching chess on TV - parodys for American football).
The series was played by many famous actors - Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" is too focused on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes a killer with Reagan's mask - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too long, and comedy moments aren't enough.
With shorter footage, the propaganda satire could work in "Comrade Detective", such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, in which two fat people devour hamburgers stacked on a large pile.
The clear message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The fictional Romanian creators were right: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not get the IAAF launch ban lifted.
The International Athletic Federation of IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on starting Russian competitors due to the state-supported doping program.
The vote in the event of the World Championship, which will start on Friday, was expected to be very clear.
166 delegates voted to extend the ban, against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the rejection is the fact that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as stated before Congress by the Chief of Special Investigation Group IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban should continue.
Some of the older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspicious athletes have not yet been questioned and there are still trainers working in the country with a damaged reputation.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-doping Agency, is not fully operational.
However, RUSADA can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and British anti-doping agencies.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said Sebastian Coe, Chairman of the IAAF.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, among other things, the last year’s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming MS, who have already proven that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to start in national colours and will not play the Russian anthem if they win.
The Bank of England shall hold the interest rate at 0,25 %
The Bank of England should announce, as expected, that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by a lack of economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has stifled speculation on sharp growth.
England's bank warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" in connection with maintaining interest rates - despite wringing family budgets.
The policy makers of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) The Bank of England voted six-to-two to maintain the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote on the interest rate increase supported the weak economic growth.
In its annual report on inflation, the bank predicted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction in family budgets would continue.
At the same time, the bank indicated that growth should occur over the next few years as a result of inflation caused by Brexit, and also stated that movitos rents should increase in financial markets more than expected.
Members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was intended to support the economy, and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, from next February, the future funding plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should start to apply, although the Bank of England has stated that it will now offer £15 billion less than planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: "MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household income and consumption burdens."
On the subject of rates, the bank stated that it would need to “tighten the belts of monetary policy” to calm inflation, “to a greater extent” than markets expect.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be “slight” and “limited”.
The bank has reduced the growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecasted in May.
The projected growth in 2018 of 1.8 % remained unchanged.
After publication of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euro.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after the disappointing increase buried the hope of further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it should increase slightly by the end of the year, according to the Bank.
The latest inflation report is a slight comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor wage increases. The bank said that the situation would get even worse before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy 'cannot prevent' cuts in revenue in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise 'significantly' towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also increase due to the great interest in British goods thanks to a weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after last August rates were reduced to 0.025% in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will last at least four years.
Prior to the bank’s decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates, along with increasing inflation, which exerted increasing pressure on households, and three political officials demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, even though the bank said it expected such a change and inflation would rise again in the course of next month.
The Bank stated that the excess relative to the 2 % target was ‘completely’ due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Because of the recent fall in swap rates, competition on the mortgage market seems to only rise as soon as creditors start competing for contracts with a view to a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing contracts and re mortgages - there are no fees available, as well as low rates that are gaining popularity."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV treatment to 10,000 patients
Patients have been given access to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention since September on the basis of the Supreme Court’s decision to fund NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period through the health service.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the Court of Appeal supported the Supreme Court’s decision last year, stating that NHS had funds to pay for PREP despite a statement that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by NHS England by Director General Simon Stevens as a ‘significant intervention’, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a ‘deciding moment’.
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 will be fully implemented across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV between patients at risk.
Pre-sex administration means that there are enough specific medicines in the patient’ s body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people, and HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who will sign their consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also register at their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program comes to taxpayers at £10 million and NHS England has signed a contract to distribute drugs this week after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should be complemented and fully utilised by the ever-expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than 30 years' effort to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: ‘We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, NSH has been offering patients who are at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and is not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will lead to improvements in the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, Managing Director of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘Priority number one must be the rapid deployment of tests throughout the country; we must make it available to each patient.
We now have a PrEP test drug and we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: ‘The beginning of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and delay by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Follow-up tests will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PREP.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those who are exposed to HIV and together end the spread of HIV in society.'
High-Length Life: Mezzanine and smart design turned this small apartment into Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former real estate banker, traded a big house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of the smart terrace Queen Anne - and is an illustrative example of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
"I lived with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
“I was looking for something for a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment at Earls Court and it was the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away and said yes to him the same day."
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone complete renovation.
One-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage space and mezzanine to use the high ceiling.
“I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed, a design and design studio based in Notting Hill, and used an almost four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height that two gaps would fit above each other - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine on which one could walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure so that at the correct height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full rooms on each other - and at the same time add to the dramatic.
On the mezzanine floor, the beautiful living room overlooks old copper window frames in Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen, if not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
But what is unique about this solution is the tipping door.
"We had to solve the technical aspect," Erfan says about reinforced veneered doors.
"The doors are equipped with counterweights so that they can roll away very easily."
Thanks to smart use of space and storage space, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, second room and better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is a residential area - or an appraisal of your property," Erfan said.
"A real estate broker essentially calculates his price on the basis of the living space when entering the apartment."
In this case, it was possible to increase the living space while maintaining quality materials that lend the space a luxurious look.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional connection with your home," Erfan added.
“You don’t love the power lines in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts will not be won."
As it turns out, quality design and the increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is disjoining.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated and declared a retaliatory ban on its citizens' travel to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, and US citizens can travel freely throughout all 50 countries.
It is that California has banned the spending of state money on the trips of its citizens to eight other states, namely Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is a strong advocate of LGBT and considers any expression of opposition to LGBT's lifestyle to be discrimination.
Tennessee, however, adopted a law of conscience according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with LGBT patient therapy is not obliged to provide it, but is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
In turn, Texas and other states have passed laws according to which religious charities that have been given children to adopt from mothers to their birth are not obliged to provide such children with equal sexual couples to adopt.
Because of these laws on the reservation of conscience, California banned the financing of its citizens' travels to eight states of the Union from its means.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have trips to scientific symposiums, for example, in Texas paid for from their universities, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
They have to get federal grants on their way, but it's absurd for the federal government to fund the trips of citizens from State A to State B or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience, and his parliament has passed a law with a resolution that he does not like California's policy of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's putting them in retaliation for a California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union that would order a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to put an end to this madness.
These are facts, now comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as decide what their money goes for and what they are not allowed to do.
Second, what is wrong with a conscience?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under penalty when butchers offering pork are enough?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or alcohol-containing cakes.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes with hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that constitutional rights of all Federation citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policies in powers that are not federal, according to their own preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California could be California and Texas could be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and let live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists seek not to be tolerant of each other and others, but to be extremely intolerant of others.
According to them, no one can ever express moral, religious, or philosophical opposition to LGBT's lifestyle again, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I do not know the situation in American history where states have done this on purpose because of political issues, except in the case of one.
Even in times of struggle for the civil rights of black people, where the North and West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1950s, the political case was slavery, and the war of the North against the South was about to take place.
Of course, there will be no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic and red republican states is deepening, and the US is mentally disintegrating.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critic got a greasy ticket.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalnyi was fined 300,000 rubles for violating the campaign rules before the presidential elections next year.
The court fined him for calling on people to participate in illegal demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests and announced that he wants to apply for head of state in March next year.
President-in-Office of the Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but it is generally expected that he will and will win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He fined him for calling on people to demonstrate through videos placed on the YouTube web portal.
The fine is 300,000.
"Later we'll take them off the judge's salary," he joked on Twitter critic Kremlin.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential elections because he was convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the judgment politically motivated.
The court also imposed fines of 300,000 rubles, i.e. 25,000 rubles, on Thursday, two members of the Naval Election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Naval in every way possible.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for stealing from Kirovles Forestry.
In May, the verdict was confirmed by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is so final, which, according to Russian law, prevents Naval from running.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, are reaching out to one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides at Toorak estate, only three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who drove the dispute over common assets and commercial assets to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but a heated dispute is constantly being disputed before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, her brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, the first store bought by a family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
This is where the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain with 160 stone stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
With money they bought additional properties and the De Lutis family portfolio now includes offices, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, flats at Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who Paul said was a "significant driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds of the assets.
The court files say Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate while Paul manages real estate for $176 million.
For Paul, the distribution of assets and funds became a problem.
"Colin's proposal sounded strongly in my eyes in his favour," Paul wrote in a sworn statement in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also competing for who will control the existing business - from which Paul said Colin had cut off.
Colin opposes the fact that this is not true and accuses Paul of mismanagement of certain properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin stated that he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that family is the most important thing," he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of sworn statements, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, flood lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and advocates of both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened his first family's jeans business, with money to build the property.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in his senior year of college, Paul was still a young, perhaps ten - year - old boy. ”
Anna De Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped that the transfer of property to their sons would take place in a good way.
"Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin stated that Mark was compensated for by $10 million on his departure and Luke by $26 million.
As Paul said, both Luke and Mark were “not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the board of AFL club, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and best friend of Colin, stated in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin replied only through a text message stating that, given the fact that the dispute is being settled in court, "I have nothing to add".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to settle the matter in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of Colin’s statements in court, he stated that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s requirements.
"Our father would be very unhappy to see our current situation," he let himself be heard and added, "he still hopes for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hope was out of sight.
"Our disputes will soon be resolved in court," Colin wrote.
Hot in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers get water and summer clothes.
At Na Chodovec kindergarten in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they only go out in the morning.
The kindergarten is after reconstruction and planted trees do not yet provide a big shadow.
There's no pool, but the teachers shower the kids in the fog.
In the afternoon, children stay in the classrooms where the blinds are closed and the curtains are closed.
The air is trying to cool down with the air purifier because they don't have air conditioning.
It's hard even for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is indoors and outdoors, exceeds the hygiene limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open operation at this time," said the kindergarten director Miloslava Makovičková.
In kindergarten there is a glass corridor, where according to her temperature is around 40 degrees.
We air out the morning after 6:00, the windows close, and we have blinds on the south side to protect ourselves.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hrazi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have grown trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree, there's a table underneath it, and we do things there," said Barbora Kompanová, the kindergarten director.
Teachers try to go to the woods with their children, where it's cooler.
Children wet hats and on the program have different games with water.
"We have a manual pressure sprayer that is used for flower spraying, and we use it to shower children," said Kompanová.
Also, the kindergarten director at Novoborská Street in Prague's Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers try to keep their children in the shadows and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a relatively large garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3:00.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a small sugary tea or a dilute juice, and they have a water drinker in the garden.
Each day, they also eat vegetable salad and always fresh fruits and vegetables, sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"Maybe today, one mother brought about ten kilos of melon for the children," she added.
Drivers get water or a summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
In most cases, the cabs of tram and bus drivers are air-conditioned, said DPP spokesperson Aneta Řehková.
Some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks haven't seriously damaged anything yet.
Minor damage occurred in a loop in the Hostivař.
At present high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have sufficient drinks.
"Cold drinking water is available in all loops, alternate points and roads," said Řehková.
In the roads and in some alternate places, employees have so-called sodobars, which produce cooled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," said the spokesperson.
The hot and dry weather of the last days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters throughout the Czech Republic destroyed 108, i.e. twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday during the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic were rising over 35 degrees Celsius, he employed firemen mainly to fight fire.
"Fires in the natural environment prevail, as well as those associated with harvest work," said spokesperson Nicole Zaoralová.
Even evening weather change did not bring relief to the firefighters, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by storms and rainfalls.
In connection with the storms, the firemen went out to 236 hits.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"The most intervened in the Central Bohemia Region," Zaoral continues.
The help of firefighters was also in Stvolínky in Českolipsko, where due to the storm they evacuated 60 people from the children's camp to safety.
Tropical temperatures have also added work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesdays and nights on Wednesdays, ambulances left for dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from karm.
So people should have their water heaters checked, warn the paramedics.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless odourless gas which is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and fainting sensation.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infected room.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media diet.
Before him, many tried and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico said that the new Chief of Staff in the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news reports on TV news - in hopes of keeping Trump on the surface.
Here's part of Josh Dawsey's report:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met on the first day in his new position with employees, he outlined the key problem of Trump’s White House, which is about to correct: incorrect information that comes into the hands of the President.
Kelly announced to the staff that he had to personally approve all information - whether on paper or spoken - because the President can make a better decision on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth to control Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump, as a candidate, was disturbed by honest reports, it was fitting to show him that in a positive light, he was talking about a lot of other media, which was easier to convince," he said to Politico Sam Nunberg, a former campaign advisor in February.
Tara Palmeri from the Politico portal then wrote that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - at least six former campaign organizers say - is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that praises him."
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his views on Twitter has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something other people don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they weren't checked.
We'll probably never know about tweets Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him in line at least several times, then their efforts did not go to waste.
But no one has ever been able to stop Trump regularly from encouraging controversial issues.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by substituting materials - which may or may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the tendency of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from reporter Shane Goldmacher's pen:
“Current and former Trump officials say that the President often responds very angryly to negative news from the media, especially information leaks, and seeks to find their origins.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone slipped the president a copy of the GotNews.com article - the website of the provoker Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the 'source of many leaks of information' from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was permanently expelled from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not support his claim with any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later dismissed them.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter “tryed to implement the system to manage and document the information that President Trump will receive.”
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to pursue the same strategy.
Maybe he turns out to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just disappear, and his helpers are still competing for power.
These immutable factors will certainly make Kelly's mission worse.
Tourists negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionary Quarter'
Several of the most mobile homeowners in West Midland, England, are once again struggling with determined tourists who negotiate with the local authorities for the rights to reclaim the field for their settlements.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near a thriving street in Solihull called the “millionaire Quarter. ”
Bringing horses, children, and an army of caravans, tourists return after being banished in May. They did not fear even a ditch that was dug on site under the regulations of the authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
The tactful group found gaps in defense and penetrated the field with caravans unprotected gap that served the way.
The angry neighborhood residents attacked the Solihull City’s board of directors, saying that “they are unable to solve the problem. ”
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymous said: ‘ They took the place Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The Governing Board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to a different place and now they're back.
Some more arrived last night, and probably more will arrive today.'
She added that : ‘Birmingham’s Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem.
I live in Streetsbrook, and I don't intend to pay any more taxes until the board settles with tourists.'
Another anonymous citizen said: ‘It’s ridiculous, we were just watching the last tourists leaving and now they’re back.
And this time there are more, and this time they brought horses with them.'
Solihull City Council Press Spokesperson said: ‘We are aware of an unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the whole problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or unlawful conduct to the police at number 101.
That'll give us the overall picture we'll present in court.'
The MEP's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
It was brought by a government special.
The government special brought the injured Robert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and on board the plane was under constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long flight planned was without complications.
Róbert Žitňanský, according to information, TV JOJ had a serious accident in Brussels early in the summer.
He said he was hit by a car, and he's been in serious shape ever since.
After transport to his homeland he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská by NOVA.
She didn't want to comment on the incident.

Italians are adhering to the fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships coming to the coast of Italy with Mediterranean immigrants unless NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
"If NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after Italy's authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The first-year rescue organization refused to comment on the matter because of the allegations made by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosios.
"For us, it is and always will be the number one priority of saving human lives. We are very sorry that we cannot operate in rescue zones at present," the organization said in a statement on social networks.
"We can comment on all current charges only after gathering all information and evaluating the situation."
The Italian authorities have been following the Iuventa ship of Jugend Retette since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board, which were handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
According to the prosecutor's file, at least one meeting was reportedly only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last designated organisation stated on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable as they do not represent any "significant change or obstacle" in terms of rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new code of conduct was rejected by the Organization of Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which holds the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minniti has been heard that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks, landing in Italy in rescue operations, suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit.
"We are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel in the last few days," the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations this month with the mayors of Libya on the topic of economic development initiative, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Shameless Mesarošová: She had silicone and cellulite coming out of the cover!
Hot summer days are all about taking on the most necessary clothes to cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does the opposite.
At the afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, moderators, singers and everyone who has anything to do with TV Prima, it was crawling, she wrapped her body in a mini-overal.
And all it took was a few normal moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her buttocks.
It's because it's been cut between her cheeks many times, and it's gotten so high, she's had to adjust it all the time.
She was certainly not in need of the attention of the masters and photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages encouraging Conrad Roy's suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of two years in prison and then spend five years in parole.
Carter was convicted in June for the involuntary killing of Conrad Roy, who took her own life on July 13, 2014.
On Thursday, Roy’s father testified in court: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was facing up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and creamy blouses, Carter stood at the scene when she announced her sentence with tears in her eyes, her tight hands and her eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
“She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
However, Carter’s attorney said that these were “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder have no significant impact on its actions.”
The prosecutor read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “There will be no day for me to mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever," said the statement.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "stalking" to the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and never be his children's aunt.
"The loss of a person I've been seeing since I was born is the pain I'm going to carry for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would affect a person helping to commit suicide from another person, thus establishing a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published that incited suicide.
"Maybe hang yourself, jump out of the building or stab yourself, I don't care," it said in a text message that Carter sent just two weeks before he died while Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to get the generator back on line and be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from commenting in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who took Carter’s side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was acquitted.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison. ”
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just the day before the notification, the Audi BMW car manufacturer stated that it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The President of the BMW said that the company believes that there are “more intelligent options than driving restrictions” in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the seat of the BMW - which are considering banning or reducing diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel atuomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the regulation on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen dioxide, which emits diesel engines, is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of automakers to install equipment to neutralize the gases emitted by diesel engines, which makes it more difficult for cars to compete.
While German car manufacturers face careful inspections, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which, in order to meet emission limits, installed software in their vehicles, which reduced the amount of emissions emitted during testing, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics of the engine development department in the Audi would have been arrested in Germany.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and is therefore not subject to extradition, so he may face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation by the German police in the case of Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to bypass European emission limits - and thus extended the charges that Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of an Audi car manufacturer in the investigation may have an adverse impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer makes an disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane crash-landed on the beach.
A man and a girl died.
An accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the Witnesses told SIC Noticias TV channel that the plane before landing flew just above the people who were sunbathing on the beach.
Some people from the beach reportedly ran from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
According to local media, a 50 - year - old man and an 8 - year - old girl died on the beach.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both escaped from the accident alive, and the police took them in for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are the motorways in the Czech Republic even completeable?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unfinished, even though it started to be built in 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, Highway D11.
At least a few months later, the Earth Children movement stopped the construction of another section.
We East Bohemians get freeways by bit, like they cut salami.
They cut the wheel, and then we'll see when and if we ever get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Endless jets of trucks drive directly through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not a reasonable roundabout.
But so far the last section of our dream highway was opened in 2008, i.e. an incredible nine years ago.
Not a damn thing since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section to Hradec Králové were recently built and further sections to Jaroměř began with an archaeological survey that started at the end of this year, you could hear a loud bang of the plugs in eastern Bohemia.
I mean, no one believed it anymore.
Last week, it turns out we're not building this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno gave decomposition.
Earth's children repeat their D1 tactics.
They attacked the building permit decision in its entirety.
In decomposition, they request a review of all the already issued binding opinions of all the institutions concerned.
For example, the Wall City Hall, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far, from D11 we ride near a village with an eloquent name Funeral.
So we're going down, we're just going down the highway, and suddenly we're standing on the side road, and we prefer to then get into the column.
The worst part is that you see stories like this all over the country.
Scary, constantly blocked road to Benešov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their Funeral.
What do Earth's Children demand?
What is the essence of the problems of the construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network practically incomplete in the current system?

Lavender from Provence Threatens Climate Change
Lavender have become a symbol of Provence in the area of south-eastern France, but they are now at risk of climate change.
Lavender is dwindling as a result of dry climate and harmful insects, causing horror on the faces of researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “Lavender trekking in Provence is at risk because in the last few years, this plant has been exposed to climate changes that bring less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
Cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria, which thrive in a dry climate, are also to blame."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil they produce is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped, and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender is, of course, smaller."
More efficient water distribution and water evaporation slowing can be a possible solution, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding of more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
Riodoc weekly staff meet regularly on Wednesdays to discuss news of the riots in the Sinaloa region involving organized criminals, corrupt officials, and constant drug wars.
Today, however, it meets mainly for its own safety under the strain of recent events.
They learn it's important that they change their habits.
Two deserving journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking your children with you to an office that someone attacked in 2009 with a grenade or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutrals, and allies.
They ask journalists to name names for every word - there is no need for any evidence, just use imagination and hunch.
Choosing them from what - drug traffickers, politicians, traders, and journalists are suspected of taking money from governments or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose job is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence continues and the bodies are piling up across the country; journalists are constantly growing among them: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, there are at least 25 of them since President Enrique Pen Niet’s rise to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven were killed in all seven states this year.
Among them also co-founder of Riodioce periodical, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on the violence associated with drug trafficking.
His loss is noticeable, even though his presence is pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the sign "Justice" pointing to the middle finger, hanging in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a T-shirt with a photograph of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, two suspects have still been sued by the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, according to the opinion of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that happen every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, which makes journalist killers very rarely come to trial.
Journalists from Riodoc insist that they inform about the violence that is happening in Sinaloa; even though they are destroyed by grief and the territory is now very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without a vision of justice, the security meeting is pointless, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoc in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to travel several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 bullets, apparently due to the name of the article - which can be translated as the 12th River.
The shooters then boarded his vehicle and crashed it near the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind his wife and two grown children.
The rumors seem to spread quickly in Culiacan.
In Valdez’s case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since last year's arrest of Guzman and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions try to fill the void.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of two - story mausoleums for drug kings, many of whom are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "equipment" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoc, still blames himself for not protecting his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with the sons of Joaquín Guzman.
The peace could upset the sons; suspected gang members bought up all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscating other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is viewed as an important milestone in the fight against journalists by Mexican criminals.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the periodical Noroeste was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and set up together with five colleagues of Riodoc.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to run journalism without mentioning the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
In time, Riodoc gained a good reputation for brave and true news; the newspapers began to thrive.
Journalists liked to go into search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the founding, Riodoc won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for the Latin America story.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was afraid for my life," he said when he received the prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a "life-style", Valdez said last October in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the role of journalist - or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What did you do in the face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?'."
The employees of Riodoc miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask, has this routine caused his death?
His death also raised questions about their own assumptions - how to do their job best and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you get involved with their women, their children, clean stores, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong here, hands off.
The trouble is, the editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that “the smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then it happened with Javier.”
The old rules according to him, as well as others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoc’s employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief before the 40 degree heat in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the Riodoc offices, which are located in a four-story building in Culiacan City District.
Journalists are making fun of whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of law enforcement officials who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been a few months since journalists last set out in mountainous areas that are essentially dominated by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's agenda.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They also have the lights on for suspicious government expenditures that took place in the home town of the governor of the state.
There have also recently been several abductions at one of the most luxurious restaurants in Culiacán, just a block from the State's Attorney's Office.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the kidnapped or the circumstances of the abduction, so journalists were alert when they were about to write about what everyone in the city knew: that the restaurant was a popular destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One journalist reads from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of political scenes for nearly a century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín's sons, "El Chapo" Guzmán, escaped the army task force.
A month ago, readers would have read about this topic in Valdez’s section, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villarreal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set out to demonstrate to the D.A.'s office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adam disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a charred body was discovered, the authorities say it's Adam based on DNA analysis.
Press activity is increasing across the country, many of which organize protests and scribble on sidewalks and "SOS Press" buildings.
The director of Bojorquez is visiting Washington today, where he is seeking international support and achieving justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa, which took place the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of watching journalists and their murders for telling the truth.
In the meantime, she requested a transfer to another department for fear that her anger might compromise her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "captured" by organized crime, corrupt officials, and indifferent public.
In his last book “Narco-journalism” he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the request of politicians and security forces working with organized crime.
The media supervisory group Articulo 19 accused police officers and public officials of more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, which occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: “This is how I ended up for my reports. ”
Next to the severed head was a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to cease their activities, such as the newspaper El Norte, based at the northern borders of Chihuahua State, in response to the murder of the rapporteur Miroslava Breachová in March.
The others continue, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing his director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with an article on the front page entitled “What Do You Want From Us?”
Some journalists fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, just as it is to get rid of the feeling that you're being haunted all the time.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, such as Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose not to give up their jobs, each day presents a great risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet once, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, which is why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight and Riodoc's employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when suddenly the phone starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and police officers near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left behind in this area by members of the syndicate promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoc website.
Not one day goes by and the opening title changes again.
The sound of the police sirens points to another shooting.
Bojorquez throws a fleeting look at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under a huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for the entire Sinaloa - all Riodoc employees follow his steps.
"How could we possibly think of leaving," Bojorquez said, "when one intern asked me to send her to the streets on the same day Javier was killed?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first finds of an amazing creature the size of a rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts have called 'Mona Lisa the Dinosaurs' - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such an extent that experts were able to determine the reddish - brown colour of his scaly skin and stated that the dinosaur had a ‘problem past’.
The article in Current Biology reported that it was “the most preserved yet found armored dinosaur and one of the best kinds of dinosaur in the world. ”
The fossil is a new species of the Nodosauridae family. Dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described him as “remarkable indeed. ”
According to National Geographic, the armored white-eater is still the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
Behind the discovery is Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He stumbled upon something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years of their work exposing an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After the work is done, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
'All you have to do is turn a blind eye and believe he's asleep,' said Caleb Brown's director and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
'It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaur - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.'
By studying his skin researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in armor and reminiscent of a walking tank - most likely faced a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a cloaking system used by many today’s animals.
Experts claim that this enabled him to blend in better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The cloaking system suggests that he was a favorite food for larger dinosaurs.
Reports of a 110 million-year-old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in the paper in May. Currently available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7000 hours with the team carefully exposing fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved fossil state, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They discovered a masking method that is commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than the lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, researchers’ findings are surprising because Borealopelta’s size far exceeds today’s animals using the same technique.
So it's possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred camouflage to confrontation to survival.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage - such as deer, zebra or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survivors.
'The production of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators in the chalk age,' said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that dinosaur skin was likely reddish - brown.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for further knowledge of its life, including preserved stomach contents, to track down its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
At that time, the region of Alberta had the same climate as today’s Florida and the rivers and oceans went much further inland than they do today.
'This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while being preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size,' said Brown.
'For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as it did in the chalk age.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just have to turn a blind eye and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
During the Cretaceous Period, giant teropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who moved on two legs, walked the Earth.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been the favorite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5-meter-long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt’s body was washed into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Behind the discovery is Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from the nose to the hip.
The animal averaged 5 metres in length and weighed up to 1300 kg.
There were two 50 cm of thorns sticking out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of Canada today until he ended up in a river that washed him into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote wrote for National Geographic, ‘finding an individual like this can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking the find is to me.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front foot with his fingers pointing up.
I can easily count scales on his feet.'
How did one activist find out the answer to the question, 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a native from St. Louis sat down on a bed in the Airbnb room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across the contribution of a high school student.
"Police just shot an 18-year-old youth whose body is still lying on the street," it said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The @TheePharoah user kept retweeting her posts on the wall.
Rapper of St. Louis posted his posts on Twitter about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18 - year - old young man who was shot by a white - white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying in a rut, no one took him out after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put her phone away to get back to him the night she was watching tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held in his hand a sign saying "The Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son"!
She was watching live news - one of the officers was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash and at the other end of a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, as she said, held in his hand the gun he was aiming at the crowd and yelled, "I will kill all of you... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell said.
"This is not the kind of murder we've gotten used to, which we can call normal.
I felt goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked a return flight and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson during the next three years describes the new document “Whose Streets? ”, which will be released to the cinemas on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and unbreakableness told from the perspective of people living in a community who go out into the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell conducted a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flower jersey and the same flower headband - on a subject that they had discussed many times before - "experience with black people".
“Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?”
"Now we're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old young man, and that's not right."
"It was out of the question that I would not take her with me," Ferrell later said.
“Today’s events are the culmination... that occurred in the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grew up in it.
It needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time it needed to recognize the difference between the different layers of experience with black people and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own, she is no different from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I could protect her from this experience, I would only harm her."
Upon arriving in Ferguson, the first stop on South Florissant Road was across from the police department, which became the base of activists who expected the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for others.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped distribute it to Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly born.
"My activism turned upside down after August 9," Ferrell said, adding that in her studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Association Student Nurses Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell became acquainted with later documentary director Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "just document" the ongoing events.
Ferrell, however, wondered: “Do you work on a documentary or are you trying to find a story that can be used? ”
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to earn money from pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an unspoken interview: “We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are often neglected, and we wanted to change that. ”
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners on death row.
Ferrell and the other six local residents who were watching the Whose Streets team in the years following Brown's murder.
"In this document nobody speaks for us, but it is our statement," Davis said.
"This was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the savior leader, but about the rapprochement of the community," said Folayan - it turned out to be the most open to film participation.
The document “Whose Streets?” describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face at the thought of the first moment when she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understood that in order to do this job and humanize black people, I had to open up."
In addition, Ferrell’s story highlights the role of an eccentric black woman in the wider aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of a teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaign below #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves weirdos.
"Black eccentric women in leadership ultimately stand behind the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that “the move is actually supported by black women and a lot of eccentric black women.”
However, she insists that “this is not merely an affivitive matter” and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her opinions.
"It was she who was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"that she was the one who found herself in the front lines is no accident, because life on these intersections in the skin of a black weirdo woman is dangerous.
You can feel the burst of energy in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, TV station cameras have cleared their positions, but severe racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell's serving two and a half years for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
She described the social political atmosphere in the area she calls home as a "disorder."
Still, it does not cease its efforts, to which it has pledged since it set off three years ago on the streets of Ferguson.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
All we have to lose are our chains."
There was a field on fire in Cologne.
There were dozens of firemen on the scene, a helicopter helped.
Near České Brod in Kolínsko, between Bylany and Liblice, a field of approximately 15 hectares was on fire from 14:00.
Fire stopped spreading around 15:15, fire department declared a third stage fire alarm out of four possibles.
According to fire spokesperson Ladislav Holomčík, the helicopter helped put the fire out of the air.
At 18:00, the firemen managed to put out the fire, the fire caused damage for CZK 700,000.
Tens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought with the flames on the spot.
The fire was created due to a technical malfunction in the engine compartment of the harvester.
Hasit also helped the helicopter, which carried out a total of six drops of water.
"Instead of the intervention, we handed it over to the owner, until 8:00 tomorrow he will be guarded by a volunteer fire department," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: The artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of the rooms in the New York Fridman Gallery there are several faces of different skin shades - white, black and brown - hanging from the ceiling on the wires. Each one of them seemed to fall out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral and hair swabs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized disclosure of secret cable on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which started on August 2nd, bears the name A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines her experience with technology, IT and art, and Manning's - transsexual and pioneering dissident, whose sentence reduced Obama three days before he left the post of President of the United States.
By algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a razor-sharp, if not intellectual comment about the yield of DNA, as well as many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken since she was young about being considered a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of 20 charges, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were held by prison employees, and only one black and white photograph of lower quality, which Manning, visibly concerned with, is sitting in the driver's seat in a platinum blonde wig she is now associated with.
In 2015, there were still positive responses to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And that's when she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were preparing an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of a new exhibition.
However, visitors and photography were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Supressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, several days after the comic book was released, President Obama applied for the release of Manning, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years in a military prison in Kansas.
It is interesting, indeed, that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war with people who seek to publish government information and transgender troops while trying to find new ways to incite hatred in areas he should support with his tweets.
In response to a question regarding this particular timing Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything is happening for a reason".
Under the statement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is filled with heart) after the end of "self-involved factionism, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - centipede letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By classifying 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to a sophisticated scientific dictionary of artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"I hope that people will get away with it, that our genome does not matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it their own way," said Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the graphic novel mentioned above.
It depicts Manning as she emerges into King Kong's style from United States Disiplinary Baracks Prison with a megaphone in her hand.
"Once they stop you from speaking, they will win," it says.
"Never let yourself be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," said the Philadelphia artist.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not yet visited the exhibition personally - which was foretold in a comic book - but when she does, she will be welcomed in the center of the room with her masks, her own genomic portraits, sorted as a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maningo, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"They were placed on walls in the past, but this time I wanted them to feel the crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and frees her."
Professor of Northwest University and employee of Oxford University wanted for murder
These days, there is a nationwide search for a professor at the University of Northwest and employees at Oxford University who are being prosecuted for suspicion of the murder of a man found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, reports the police.
On Monday, a warrant for first-degree murder was issued for a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, reports the Cook County case file.
The paper says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
Chicago P.D. said the body of the deceased was found on July 27th.
On arrival at Grand Plaza Apartments, the police found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the scene and the detectives are investigating the case as a homicide while the police are looking for both suspects, according to the authorities.
Lathem worked as a lecturer in microbiology and immunology at the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of Public Relations University, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The whole matter is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the University of Northwest is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A spokesman at the University and Somerville College said in a statement sent by e-mail: “We were contacted by the British police and we are prepared to assist the US police as well. ”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole reality and wish him to apply to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations with the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling on suspects to surrender to the appropriate authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts, and their efforts to track down suspects are escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional, and national authorities assist in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management has issued a statement for all residents: “Police are now working to compile a time sheet and profile of the victim, investigating various motives, including domestic violence. ”
"In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mutko
Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitala Mutko said that it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“A part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to planning and testing in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the code contains nothing that should worry Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the above criteria calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation investigated by Richard McLaren about the alleged government's doping sponsoring of Russian athletes.
On the subject, Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation, since our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
However, there were no state programs in our country and we cannot confess to something that never existed."
Mutek's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, Director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian RSport Smirnov, he admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but he added: “On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of performing doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation allowed planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
After visiting the Moscow headquarters of the organization in July, the CEO of WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was "on the right track" to renew its validity.
Police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police have accused three men of setting up the Wednesday fire of a rare wooden church in Třinec-Gutech on Frýdecko-Místek.
One accused is a minor, all three are Czech national.
They face up to 15 years in prison for a general threat offense.
Today, the Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told journalists.
He said it was an intentional crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," he said.
He said the police would discuss the possibility of taking the accused into custody.
Further information may not be disclosed to the Director.
"I can't say more yet, because the criminal police and investigation staff and the prosecutor who oversees the matter are actually working on the matter," said Kuzel.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Material damage will go to tens of millions of crowns according to preliminary estimates, but historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire began to consider the restoration of the church.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, additional costs are prepared to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the City, a public collection is also being prepared and a contribution from the owner of the monument, i.e. local parishes, is expected.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by a malfunction in the wiring.
Then an exact copy was made in his place.
The state is counting on citizens to defend the state.
They'll support their training.
With financial support for associations used in the defense of the state, voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the substantive intention of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state is envisaged.
The Ministry of Defence, which was tasked with processing it from the government, promises from it that it will be able to increase the physical fitness of Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This is based on a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the defence.
According to its authors, the basic aim of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the Czech population to defend the state, outside the performance of a defence obligation and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the state would support associations of amateurs, shooters, or cynologists financially or material and would enable them to increase their members’ capabilities.
In return, he would obtain data on people who are willing to come to the aid of the country in times of crisis, and on their abilities or material equipment, if necessary.
There could also be accredited instructors to help associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It is also expected to organize discussions with war veterans or people who have been heroic.
One possible option assumes that there would be a new office in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the state would use their abilities only after the state of threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual wipe-off of previously obvious borders between different types of threats," the idea is to refer to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministries have noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just those of the military.
"The basic aim of the intention is to create a very broad base, which will enable every citizen to respond in a qualified manner to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to make it difficult for the armed forces of the Czech Republic to carry out their tasks," he says.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen option.
For example, the Office envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million a year.
More money would go to pay or build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that it would have to expand the scope of regional military headquarters, which would together employ 42 additional soldiers.
The representatives of the Ministry have already stated that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union Arms Directive.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons that the directive prohibits.
Startups to help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but she didn't find an adequate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unprofitable, or even misleading.
And even though she promised the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the hair care company Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, who employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New startups from the field of human resources are constantly appearing in the market, which help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the particular intention of measuring employees’ duties, startups allow companies to vote quickly, target specific teams and demographic groups, also offers absolute anonymity of employees and hotline for complaint, and in some cases also allow informants to bypass their superiors and contact the director directly.
"There are instruments like Strava and Fitbit on the market that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the startup of Glint based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that Glint made her more aware of what her employees were thinking and how they were feeling in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and the votes of specific teams, Glint offers a thermal map of the company and a brief overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low rating managers - which allows the user to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to pay attention to the culture of the working environment - in case they become another Uber - which is thrown into scandals after a former employee posted a post on his blog describing the company environment and harassing employees who dare speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global sector of control, regulation and compliance by 2020 may exceed $18.8 billion.
Startup Convercent from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Almost 600 Convercent clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He recently accepted Uber under his wing.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable flash surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
Where the Director-General is involved, complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has authorized regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the startup Convercent.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behavior - and if regulators do not intervene - it can face costly consequences as a result of customer boycott, employee exhaustion or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
Ruby Tuesday’s restaurant network, employing over 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses the Convergence for more than a year to raise employees’ awareness of corporate policies and procedures and ensure easy way to contact corporate management.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace a phone number or e-mail to the management of the company, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
Often it was a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, the general representative of Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no reliable way to track complaints from employees.
Now that the company is using the Convercent, rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never been reached before by managers, sitting in offices, for miles away from the real solution of complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"This is coming closer to a holistic, overall view of employees' experience," said Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"We also protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
The companies ceased to take the ethics, values and participation of employees lightly in 2002 after Arthur Andersen’s accounting firm collapsed after Enron’s fall on the abuse of employees’ ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But it was only when “social media was shining on the whole thing,” that companies began to realize that in the online world they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet.
"Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by courageous capital investors, which supported both start-ups.
As part of his February campaign, Convercent raised $10 million in total from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually took away $47 million in capital.
Glint won $10 million in November from Bessamer Venture Partners and won $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The increasing number of researches clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to see that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that seeks a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits of LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies thrive, if their employees are satisfied.
And when there is an analytical tool on the market that ensures employees' commitment and commitment to the company, it is no wonder that there are many investors who will support this effort.
According to experts on working culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that when a company applies for feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change does not occur quickly - at worst, at all - it can cause disappointment and lack of interest to employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4,000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who witnessed many companies that relied too much on the data itself.
“Because as soon as you don’t finish things, the employees start asking themselves, ‘ Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'""
Madison Reed, who now regularly conducts a survey among employees each month, is able to solve the problem within one day thanks to Glint, says Errett.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganise several teams within the company and start communication training to solve the problem successfully.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the long term in a field known for frequent redundancies.
"If you do not seek to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," Vitrano added.
“And once you start losing your employees, you lose your customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt."
Thursday has become the hottest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in Hodonínsk.
He thus surpassed the Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed about this.
Compared to Thursday, but not many temperature records have fallen.
Vedra hit mainly Moravia, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years have been broken or evened.
On Thursday only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
In Strážnice, for example, today's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice, Břeclavsko, today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of degrees and in Pohořelice, Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures have appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice it was the hottest in Dyyákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclavsk, where mercury reached 37.8 degrees but did not beat the record.
On the other hand, according to ČHMÚ's website, for example in western and northwest Bohemia, today's highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures only started to grow there later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade, according to ČHMÚ and on Sunday there could be even more significant rains.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia as well as on Saturday.
We've had such a bad time here.
Billionaires are not content with the same vote in elections as every single adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as cheeky as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues in the water Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors Robejškovy Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the entrepreneur in real estate Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Condemned corrupter and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valento acquired the Party of Privates.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project Andrej Babiš inadvertently named Kroměříž mayor Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter for himself.
The mayors have also recently captured their billionaire.
It is Dalibor Dědek, owner of the company on Jablotron security equipment.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
The Entrée in the mayor's jersey didn't work out so well.
"I never dreamed of small targets," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the YES movement to win 20 percent in the election.
Some of them smiled.
But Grandpa's slip is more typical.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of firm opinion.
Although he intends to apply for votes in the mayor's jersey, he continues to support Andrei Babiš.
The grandfather supported Babiš in the previous parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule over the pleasing rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote before the 2013 elections.
But he certainly does not go into politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
Babiš will remain a hero to me.
He's willing to step out of his world under his control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the mayors to learn to imagine possible cooperation with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his mind and stands up for himself no matter what jersey he wears.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending his B to the Mayors to build someone this clumsy.
Others may wonder if Jablotron's boss may have broken up with Agrofert's boss in a bad way at the store and is not looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
But Grandpa's first public appearances were not just about Babiš.
Grandpa promised to send 10 million crowns to the mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard for anyone to stop saying that.
After all, the court-recognised thug Zdeněk Bakala spent millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Vít Bárta, TOP 09 and the citizens' democrats have come together for almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law forbids anyone to give the political party more than three million.
If Grandpa's going into politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe he wouldn't have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
He crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for tax advantages of families with studied children.
People with college education will spend about 50 grand a month in our country.
The ones with the basics of less than 20.
A man with 50 grand is rich in local conditions.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Grandfather's vision, the poor pay their taxes honestly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of a social state in which they are not too involved.
Rich people simply need to be helped not to work hard with poverty.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš has to wash his hands.
Thanks to Grandpa, the rest of us can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question remains who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not consider the members and members of their party or the citizens and citizens of the state as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want all people to live well in a rich country, not just some.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex must have reduced by 234 million.
Sometimes selling real estate isn't easy.
And it's not often 11 bedrooms, beautiful sea views, or the fact that US President Donald Trump is selling the property.
At the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down by an incredible £8 million.
He informed Mirror.co.uk about it.
The brochure says, "Greetings, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the merger of a real estate company with the US president did not defend an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by an incredible £8 million.
The original value of the property was £21.5 million, the final price fell to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex is worth about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And no wonder.
The magnificent 5 acres mansion on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees planted on the property.
From the terrace there is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers has shown itself on the prize.
Now the property is closer to the normal prices of property on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But with the new prize, they rank second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to quit two trainings a day.
The 11th in the morning is coming, and UCLA football players are squeezing at the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal sweaty backs, the unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team members these few minutes of doing nothing supplicates the lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the rooms after three hours of training to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place at 6:30 a.m.
“The next three days will be hard work for these guys,” said coach Bruins Jim Mora just before Monday rolled over on Tuesday.
By taking out two trainings on one day, the NCAA wants to lighten the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
This is why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 19:15 - to fit into already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora spent as a coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp starts a week before last year and the training sessions are limited during the summer semester.
Eighteen training sessions are scheduled until August 20, after which formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
Mora let himself be heard to support the NCAA’s decision, despite adding another item to an already charged player’s diary.
“For three or four days, players are under a lot of stress and it is very exhausting for them,” Mora said.
“But nobody gave up, everyone tries. They’re great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the training camp, which will not be easy to look at the clear lines of surrounding plots from the adjacent parking lot and luxury hotel Luskin Center, which was occupied by players after collecting the protective net behind the goal bar.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there might be a problem.
"The property will be guarded by security services," Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not impossible that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
That kind of stuff is good for business.
Fortunately, the hotel will guard security as well as parking lot 8.
We'll use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will be all right.
It's all planned."
Facebook is planning a more thorough check of facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to third parties to control and display findings under original posts in an effort to combat the so-called “fake news,” said the largest social network on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes that it will send to third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook was described as one of the main sources of false reports, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports affected the election of the President of the United States last year.
There are political debates on the matter in Europe, and French voters are flooded with an avalanche of false reports about the May presidential elections, and Germany is planning to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of the September elections if it does not quickly remove angry contributions.
On Thursday, in his next statement in Germany, Facebook stated that it was planning to launch testing of a new fake news check function in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying reports verified by third parties, people ask for more content to be better informed and to be able to make the right decision about what they can share," said the product manager of Facebook News.
She added that Facebook continues to test the function of "related articles" and is also working on other changes in order to reduce the number of false messages.
Create a graphic novel: a story about A Castle in England
The small castle Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the music video of the Squeeze group, and Margaret Thatcher also found her refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
Scotney, however, witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy spot near the Bewl River in Kent, Britain, which inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes of York County - a famous hobby in historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"The sight of the writing of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," Rhodes says with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in the castle Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Eduard period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
“This is his thumbprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
If I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm going back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support from National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of staying in the castle almost as a dream. (To tell you the truth, I have extended my stay a bit.)
Rhodes spent time exploring Victorian “new” castle, browsing archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as hyenas on the wall and bottles that had been dumped in the ditch for centuries.
He walked around the property and examined the ruins of the old castle, talked to gamekeepers, gardeners and sometimes also artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Last night, he was "drinking whiskey and writing."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as National Trust did not gain access to documents until 2006 after the death of Elizabeth Hussey's last heir.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, employees were only beginning to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words such as “the aristocratics of many centuries scatter their hands with the words, ‘Bring it into the attic’.
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps of property: "You may think the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were fighting over birch.
Stop it, guys!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a stepping stone and sink deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of a riot in the castle from 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book," Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought that rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected in the end."
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle - such as The Priest, who tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th - century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered only a few years after the coffin was discovered).
Rhodes’ favorite family is Darrell’s: “I was intrigued by the male race — men of that time were always in debt and were spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
Various generations of the Darrell family dealt with this by marrying rich or old wives - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to shake the heads of heirs."
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is searching for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week gig in the Finnish wilderness, where he drew inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said to myself, 'Now get the hell back into real life'."
Washington is changing the terms of the green card award
The media has published President Donald Trump's words on the new U.S. immigration plan, which will also bring about a change in the green card award.
It is expected that the number of legal immigrants will thus fall by 50,000 year on year as a result of stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
New rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers. We will do so by changing the rules of green card issuance to other countries’ residents.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will favour English-speaking applicants who abound with funds and demonstrate the skills that will benefit our country," Trump, quoted the media, said.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it looked like 2017 couldn't be any more bizarre, a report about the technological development of sex robots would appear on the Internet.
Yes.
Sex robots are really popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots must be taken seriously.
Customers can choose eye color, nipple shape and robot nail appearance.
"People make fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more," Sharkey said on the occasion of publishing the report.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable pans to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course artificial intelligence, which mimics human behavior.
The user can edit the robot in his image - from eye color and nipple shape to appearance and nail color.
However, it is very disturbing that many robots have their own "personality" that would embarrass even Stepford's missus.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set different character traits for his replacement wife, including shyness.
And then there is the sex robotic woman Roxxxy Gold of True Companion, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shy nature and "wild Wendy" with a "adventure" nature.
"The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to suit your personality as much as possible," says True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She can be tired, talkative, or "in the mood."
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - which do not include confusion for real interpersonal relationships. More disturbing are the inferior female characteristics and violent innuendo - e.g. frigid (read resisting) Farrah.
True Companion likens Roxxxy to a man's vibrator on its website.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxx?" it says on the page.
But sex robots are not just fetishes or sexual aids.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - moving away from ideal or sexual equality towards desire for captivating sex with an optional premium.
Of course, most men do not buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots remain on the edge of the public's interest.
However, this marginal interest may become a mirror set by modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until the free market gives them an excuse.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world earn their rights and sit in the White House with a president who is often very defamatory about women.
The most terrifying aspect of the series The story of the handmaiden is not what we see - hanging bodies and hollowed out eyes, as is the reality of these visions.
The story of the handmaiden represents a step in the right direction, but at present it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should resemble real women as much as possible (although with porn actress rates).
Their creators construct them to be pleasant to the touch and to act at first sight as a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality, ” a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work, no history, nothing to instigate their independence or undermine their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
21st century talk: maids.
NBA star on green chives.
Curry's fighting for cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not get lost despite a botched first swing at the opening start among professional golfers.
Double winner of the award for the most useful NBA player in the Ellie Mae Classic tournament played the lower series Web.com Tour in the first round of 74 shots in Hayward in California and will fight for cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won a second title with the Warriors team in the NBA this season, began very nervously and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked near fairway.
Even then, he was not as accurate among the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four lashes above the par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first hit, but then it worked out a little bit," Curry said with the huge stage fright.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I was hoping for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he said.
If Curry manages to fight his way through the cut, which will probably be set two blows below the par, he will become the first representative of another sport who can do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the stage fright, I think I can," said an enthusiastic golfer who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, it starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic he got a sponsorship exception and maintained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is about one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Against that Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense
The unmistakable sign of Trump’s era is the political divisions that divide American voters and break families on a micro scale.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers were full of advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
All we're saying is we're just waiting for them to loosen our nerves.
But less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to unite the family.
I'm talking about it because my cousin, a poet and a left-wing fan who lives in Chicago, visited me in New York this week and paid for a Republican fool for a long time in our family.
She reminded me that closeness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden, the whole family - including all the Republican siblings she's been bickering with about politics for years - is on the same page.
It is a good thing to have dinner at the family table; but I am struck by the fact that it poses a significant risk in the wider context.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the terrifying possibility that one day his jesterry might lose its attractiveness.
However, there is an even more gruesome long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to its standards, will suddenly be the epitome of what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (at least we had an awareness of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it will suffice for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a tremendous improvement.
We used my cousin's visit, and we took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel run by the New York Park Department - for your three dollars, you won't find a better use, unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the central cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed and stare at their own shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy look and the tinkering music is strangely reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés will soon get tired: the view from the tall buildings, the panorama looks at you, instead of breathing on you the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your imaginations.
Thirty-five years later, I still did not get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese - not including Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the London metro station.
However, the carousel in Central Park has a remarkable magical experience, to the extent that two two - year - old children enjoy it as well as two mature women.
If I could evaluate the carousel, it would deserve maximum points, but fortunately no one asks.
This week I experienced a similar experience at the store when I was asked to review my “experience” on a scale of one to five when I paid with a credit card.
It's the same thing at a coffee shop on the corner of my street, with the difference that I can tip 15% for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is forced to interfere in the favor of shoppers when there's no need.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I reluctantly rated my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts on his wrists that the prison said he caused himself after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appeal against the original murder conviction.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of the morning on Valentine's Day 2013 with multiple gunshot wounds through the door of a closet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he mistook her for a thief.
The prosecutors announced their intention to reapply, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they said was too mild.
National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius threatens to extend his sentence to up to 15 years.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a panda reared in captivity gave birth to a cub that mated in the wilderness.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of captive pandas.
A staff member of Zhang Zhong Centre told New China that panda farming is at great risk of inbreeding.
Only 471 pandas lived in captivity at the end of last year.
There are only two thousand of them left in the wild.
Trying to mate the captured pandas with the wild ones is so the first step to keeping the pandas safe.
Fifteen-year-old Cao-cao was launched into the nature reserve at the beginning of Pandí's mating season on 11 March.
Thanks to a tracking device on their necks, scientists could observe her every move.
She met her chosen one Cao-cao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and ended successfully.
This too can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males misjudge the time when the female is ready, and they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on Greece's territory for illegal camping.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained on August 1 in the morning by the Sithonian police.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated for bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities tightened the rules on free camping and impose strict fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not permitted.
Checks will take place throughout the season.
The Ministry has stated that the court may impose a fine.
Drinking is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková appears on 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
The golf course in the Scottish Kingsbarns managed to score one punch under the par when she played three birds and two bogeys.
Twenty-two-year-old Czech player thus has the hope that she will pass through the cut for the first time at the famous major.
Entering the $3.25 million subsidy competition was best released to the American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the 64-shot record, eight below par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed down 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Netherlands Food Safety Authority has announced that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which it considers to mean that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority pointed out that the risk is only a limited number of egg types identifiable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but the potential threat is to children.
Czech SVS spokesperson Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also acceded to the closure of breeding, have not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians shall take random samples of eggs and chicken originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets problem insecticide brands have emerged.
According to veterinary administration, eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
However, there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is a part of the preparations against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss her, says goalie Sedláček and looking for engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there someday," smiled 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in a Zlin jersey.
Depends on whether he's getting an engagement by the start of his new year.
What were the four years you lived in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like I did at school, it'd be three.
I didn't catch much the first year, I had an experienced goalie in front of me.
I've been studying.
The second year, I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie, with whom I took turns.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch all the time.
But during the opening ten games, we only got, like, five points, so the coaches started shooting it.
At the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for the next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is KHL for goaltenders?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, who must change their game style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the field.
The difference is, the Russians want to play to the blanks.
Less shoots, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic after all.
Did you have a problem traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually designed to play like four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians even perceive their club in KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, together with basketball it's a national sport.
Everybody's a fan.
Even if it didn't work out, a lot of people walked.
Did Dinama's work in KHL help Latvia to almost advance to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been played since 2008 and Dinamo has been played since the beginning.
And from the same time on, their results at the World Cup started going up.
At the 2014 Sochi Olympics, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to the next level.
More and more Latvian players are heading for the Czech extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts came through in Zlín and before signing the contract is Ralphs Freibergs.
How come so many of them come here?
They're not B players, they're really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still out of engagement?
By the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't continue in Riga.
That's how we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the final, they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín, waiting for something to pop up.
Doesn't it make you nervous?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what would happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home after a while.
I picked something up at KHL, so I'll take it another way.
The only question is, when and where do I sign?
How realistic is the possibility that you will start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
Let's see what happens in a month, where things turn out.
Now all I can do is wait for the agent to speak.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season wasn't such that I could choose.
So I'm waiting for a phone call.
The government fling at Let continues.
In January of this year I wrote in the article With the care of a proper manager, among others, about the camp at Lety u Orlíku.
The nature of the problem remains the same, so I would like to remind myself of the key passages of the article.
Camp Lety has been mentioned for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it is probably best if they look, for example, at the official site of the cultural monuments Pietná place Lety.
At the beginning of the historical survey they will learn that the camp stood two kilometres east of Lety village, that from 8.8. 1940 served as a work camp, from 1.1. 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2.8. 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first flight prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On 4 May 1943, 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense sufferings of human beings that have been caused by human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no question that these events must be constantly remembered.
Nor is it disputed that this remembrance should take place at the memorial at the site of the suffering suffered by these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten and in the 1970s a pig farm was built nearby and on parts of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid - 1990 ’ s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but it has not yet.
In 1998 the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 it has been administered under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So much for the facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was only last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pig farm.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "some numbers exist, but I'd probably be obstructing those intentions if I went public with them."
Let's see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, others say the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it's not gonna be a cheap thing.
Yet only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a memorial, in which the state invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was beautifully financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is not likely to happen, I think it would still be a waste of money.
Does the government have no other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified memorial place, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and whoever wants to, can bow to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I don't see any reason to change that!
Let's just leave it as it is, and let's keep the memorial place as thorough as possible.
A responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, should treat the property entrusted to him, i.e. taxpayers' money.
At least with one like your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
But I still see the motto of the leader of the YES movement from the above point of view as an empty election declaration.
This May, I went straight to see the place.
Very decent driveway, landscaped parking lot, replicas of wooden camp buildings.
In one exhibition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with a seating area and a view of its own memorial place, which is made of stones located in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as appropriate and belonging.
Archaeological research is currently taking place at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, a part of the exposed foundations could be preserved and made available at least visually in an appropriate manner.
In this direction, the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could strain his efforts.
If he manages to enforce the buyout of a pig farm for state money in the government, it will just be another unfortunate step in his already problematic work as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: diets rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million U.S. citizens and 300,000 UK patients causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and dairy to relieve symptoms, but researchers at Washington University have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps create immune cells that promote intestinal resistance.
The study director, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the degradation of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tilt to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of the research, scientists discovered the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that promote body tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if the same thing turned out to apply to humans, then a combination of L. reuteri bacteria and tryptophan-rich diets would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
The postgraduate researcher, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice kept separate cells.
Inferred from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were tested by a DNA pooling method, and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells missing from the second group of mice.
The mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked intestinal microbiome - so they didn't develop this kind of immune cells - they were given L. reuteri - and they developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
The immune cells evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the fluid, it has been shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri bacteria cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been detected in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably strive for the development of these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
A potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase the cell population."
José Mourinho considers signing the contract with Nemanj Matić and his transfer to Manchester United to be “genius”
Manchester United has won "genius" on his team in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the midfielder debuted in Wednesday's game against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a £40 million contract, presented himself in the first match with a win of 2:1 in Dublin – the last preseason match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday – and impressed the midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in the team’s pre-season Asian tour, Matić was not in shape and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinh, must be worked on before the next Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent, and has a brilliant mind - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romela Lukak also played the first game at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho slowly starts to form his 11 for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign with three other players, but insists that the club has done a “fantastic job” and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you for helping me win three out of four players," he added.
"Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they did the best they could for me."
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins Ládi Pear.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promising picture began to emerge thanks to a new show on TV Prima Zdenek Academy.
The pear immediately smelled a chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to sign up for your cooking academy because, hand to heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he invited him in the social media video.
And since those two have been on edge for several years, he hasn't forgotten to irritate Lada this time either.
"In return, I can teach you nanojuice from diet chicken, American cucumber, or invite you to the water and show you why fried cheese is popular," Pear.
He's really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss says," he said to Lightning.
But Pohlreich didn't express himself because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, Boss!
Only Prima responded to Pearka's participation in the culinary academy, considering the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes outside the television.
Hruška hit Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cook.
In a few days, she sold over 300,000 pieces!
The new show that Prima presented yesterday at a press conference for the autumn broadcast scheme is a genuine cooking school.
The Pohlreich selects his pupils from among the spectators and introduces them to 12 chefs in twelve episodes.
In the last episode of his show In November 2014, Zdeněk had his shirt ironed with a crossed out pear.
If he had my face in there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I just smile over the pear - pear is a healthy fruit and has lots of vitamins," Ladya responded.
He thinks of Lada's culinary arts.
"To cook according to Ládi Pearka is not an option even at home, because I am not going home to eat gastropunk," says the boss.
Zdenek Pohlreich is very much appreciated, even according to him I make chicken for honey.
But his recipes are definitely not going to show up on my show," Pearka did not forgive himself.
He's an asshole!
He's no chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic analphabet or asshole," said Pohlreich about Hrušek at a lecture.
"I'm not 20 years old to be able to wave my hands at them, but I don't worry about them anymore," Hruška said.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house by waving
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip put into his body. With a simple wave of his hand he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty - three - year - old Steven Northam implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and currently offers the same service through his BioTeq company to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
Dr Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the procedure for implantation and compliance with treatment procedures.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service of exchange of door and car locks compatible with microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
One child’s married father had technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts with a simple wave of hand.
The White House prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the American manufacturing industry last month came to $24,000 according to the Navy records issued by the TIME Weekly.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the program of 17 July in the White House, which was a show of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials were inspecting a product show from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn in the framework of an "exceptional" event, reported the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the units responsible for the helicopter management.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event," wrote HMX-1 commander in an e-mail to his superior, deputy commander of the Air Force the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 on the occasion of the show, the beginning of which is scheduled for 3 p.m. and will remain in place until the entire place was completely cleared, which was planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail also said that if there is a delay on departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to the Working Time Regulation.
The original crew remained on site that evening along with the helicopter and along with them a unit of security personnel.
It was not apparent from the records - which the weekly TIME - that the second crew was finally sent.
Hatch Act prevents civil servants from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible breach of this Regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was fine," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you've been blocked," wrote the deputy commander.
This show "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the President advocated a health reform that went through the Senate and talked about trying to keep the government in check.
The use of air transport vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents use them to travel.
However, their presence, purely for presentation reasons, is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane was driving in the background during his first rally in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
"The White House is pleased with the show 'Made in America', which was presented by the products of all 50 states produced by Americans from American materials," said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington and South Lawn area and practice possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to Made in America was part of the current crew training, said the state official.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew in the framework of "non-president support missions" for another eleven hours.
The White House said that no more props were paid out of taxpayers' money.
Spokesperson Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in any way in the negotiations for the helicopter issue on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not retain budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the parade is, according to the Navy, difficult to determine.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, the reimbursement of the DoD’s expenditure for VH-3D amounts to $2,380 per flight hour.
Unit logs indicate a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
"It is very misleading to report the costs of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenses," Walters said.
‘These estimates shall include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual costs.’
According to the RAND 2015 study, reimbursement of DoD expenditure does not include personnel costs, but includes fuel costs, maintenance costs and contractual costs.
Back then, White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated the use of a helicopter for show purposes.
"The Idea Show this week is to present products produced in the USA," Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state and that they provide jobs to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we pride ourselves on helicopters and other military facilities, the production of which involves countless American citizens.
This fact is to be recalled."
It's not clear if Trump was also on a helicopter during his rounds at South Lawn. The only thing to say for sure is that he was behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House Trump approached a representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I own three of my own."
A young woman got stuck in a swamp near Mácha Lake, and the police used to wade to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around 2:00 in the morning.
Instead of bathing, she remained trapped in the marshes.
When she decided to ask the police for help on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent battery.
"That is why police officers soon lost contact with her," said police spokesperson Ivana Baláková.
Several police patrols set off to a location that she described, but finding a young woman was not easy.
"Some of the police had to wade through the reed wetlands hundreds of meters before they felt the ground under their feet again," Baláková said.
And so was the missing person.
The officers were guided by the direction from which her cry for help was based.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count down aloud," said the spokesperson.
Cops didn't find a woman until 3:45 in the swamps in Borný.
She was on the verge of physical and psychological strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance she called took her to the Czech Republic hospital.
The connection of Grandpa to STAN?
The bride you're looking for becomes a sales girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project, search engine.cz, it's as if a billionaire is basically telling voters that STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also confirmed that a politically disparate group of less-known mayors and independents, in fact, has no national agenda for the House of Elections.
Its electoral candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, no matter what political opinion he has.
That's how Vit Bart started once, and it didn't turn out very well.
With his rush to decent people and personalities, who will eventually replace some mayors on the candidates, which Gazdík also admitted, Grandpa also cancels the popular argument of the head of STAN that the greatest value of the movement is politically vetted and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians and according to surveys.
Now they'll be replaced by a quick collection of unknown personalities.
The total breakup with the People's Party, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the People's Candidates.
But if only a few people suspected of identity at the time, after Grandpa's arrival, the mere game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík has long been opposed to YES Andrei Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Grandpa, who publicly praises Babiš, said as follows: "My goal is that the YES movement, that is, the Mayors movement, should gain twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't get the movement wrong.
Grandpa is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is certainly not an accident.
He often talks about politics like Babiš, but he does not build his own political brand.
For some time now, STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Grandpa's sidekick seems to be making the bride you're looking for even more a sales girl.
STAN went for a while with TOP 09, then with the People's Party, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope we hear from someone.
Police dogs trained in Most by helicopter
Dogs specialized in explosives search and search dogs today practiced helicopter crossings at Lake Most.
The police dog must not be timid and be afraid of flying, said the head of police cynologists of the Ústí Region Petr Tomášek.
It takes about two years to train a police dog.
Both adult trained dogs and those who are still undergoing training practiced at the Bridge.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were to detect sharp explosive samples around the lake and look for a missing figure, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in the helicopter.
So as soon as the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter ride.
"Helicopter arrives, dog goes and immediately looks," said Tomášek.
A dog that is restless or unable to start working immediately on a helicopter journey is excluded from training.
"Most dogs then keep them for example in the garden," Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with various specializations in the Ústí Region.
German shepherds prevail, but also Belgian shepherds grow.
The dog takes care of him from the puppy.
"He raises it himself, prepares it for a service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary tests that may reveal possible health disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, he takes the first exam in 20 months.
"He gets into sharp intervention about two and a half to three years," Tomášek added.
The length of police duty depends on the condition of the dog.
They usually serve between eight and ten years of age.
They usually live with their dogs.
Trailer for the 3rd Narcos season: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture and Cali Cartel becomes the center of the Netflix hit series
Despite the end of the second Narcos season, when Pablo Escobar's killer is discovered, the Netflix series is far from over.
The confirmation from the streaming service has already been given the third and fourth season - the first one has already been named the first trailer and the outline of other negative characters.
In season three, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of the four influential godparents, they operate “as a society from the Fortune 500 ranking,” only with the difference that violent acts escalate and more government officials bribe.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brain of operations, Pacho Herrer (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
Pedro Pascal returns in the new trailer as Javier Peña, a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third Narcos season will have its premiere on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, have stated a UN representative in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Auxiliary Mission, said that hundreds of women participate in local council elections, three women apply for vice presidentship, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be ignored," he said in his Wednesday statement.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate, as well as any related election-related processes.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban released several threats against the electoral process, which shifts international combat activity to a second place.
For the first time in this year's election, one democratically elected government gives its power peacefully to the following government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
Afghanistan’s independent electoral commission said that of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The unique brewery is re-cooking beer.
For a good beer to the resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned to life a few years ago the brewery in Lobč u Mšeno.
The brewery mentioned for the first time in 1586 has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was converted into an aeromachine operation.
After years of flourishing, the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during World War II production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, buildings have served the state estate.
The works of destruction were completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building materials.
In 2007, however, there was a new hope in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov.
They began to repair buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of construction and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to studying archive materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
Brewery has the same shape as in the nineteenth century when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded by the declaration of the brewery for cultural memory by the Ministry of Culture and the construction became a part of the European industrial heritage trails.
In 2015, they festively restored the tradition of brewing beer.
To taste a great Lobe beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínska, visit the bar in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use Kokořín water in the protected landscape area, malt from lobe fields and hops in Žatec.
In the bar you will taste traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And don't miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and 1:30.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its kind on a global scale?
This unique building was to be the fortress Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, on the top of the terrain ridge above Babí village.
Originally, it was intended to consist of up to 12 bunkers connected by large underground.
This was supposed to be headquarters, barracks, ammunition warehouses, materials, power plant, engine room and hospital.
The construction was terminated by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct a unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
Subterranean access is 75 percent!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with an exhibition and underground, the complex also includes an armed object of light fortifications, two built infantry cabins, trenches and educational trail of Fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshment, cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building was listed next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian's port near Rome or the Assyrian palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
The monastery of Chotěšov originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged building of a convent over a beautiful garden.
The list on which it got, but unfortunately, belongs to unique buildings that are threatened with extinction.
However, the enthusiasts do not want to give up and organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is another year of the Chotěšov Monastery Evening on Saturday, August 5th, where Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Voda, will perform, you will see fencing performances and you will look at the places of beautiful large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Meet the plant with one click.
A new free Pl@ntNet application will help students with the creation of herbarics and ordinary plant lovers.
If they are interested in what plant they have just encountered on a walk, this app will advise them.
All they're going to have to do is photograph the plant, and the app itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was introduced on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Ethical and Environmental Education Centre in the Mountain Park in Bratislava as part of the City’s Secret Life project.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also participated in the project, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers in the application database.
The newly created French app is available for free download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of French programmers was to contribute as many people as possible to the application with their images, increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Children who can hold a tablet or a mobile phone can go into the forest," said Ivana Poláčková, coordinator of this project.
Based on a sufficiently high quality photograph of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name within seconds, which it then assigns under the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the project Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute to the application with a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
"The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková informed.
GMB concerns about the investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The unions demand assurance from the managers of McVitie's Biscuits manufacturer about the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish trade union GMB stated that, for the time being, the company is not silent about any investment in the Tollcross plant.
More than 500 employees work at the factory, who produce Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies among other products.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said that over 5 million pounds had been invested in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that employees and representatives of trade unions would be among the "first informed" in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In their letter to the construction company manager, the GMBs expressed their concerns that McVitie's would not "be able to make promises about financing and modernising production lines."
The main organizer of the GMB Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the contractor about the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
There were generations of many families working here, and employees mostly come from the local community and the Glasgow area, where work at the factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
From the point of view of work, wages and benefits - and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising life costs and declining slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie's."
Pladis’s spokesman said: “The Builder Tollcross only received a letter from GMB yesterday, and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we value the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
Regular meetings with employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago and many problems were openly discussed at this meeting.
We spoke with employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested £5 million in Tollcross, especially in production lines and streamlining operations.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the local site, and in case of any changes in the operation of the local factory, employees and union representatives will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to take his side after she has deposited £189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but has this French team warned Barcelona of its record raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer stirred up the water of summer transfers. Club Ligue 1 is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, which paid $89 million for it last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the world's best paid professional athlete - after tax, he will receive over £500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar made his deal, despite the fact that the confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this three years ago by the president of the PSG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
“I’m not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly reach out to one of their players,” said Al-Khelaifi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to win one of our players, they will face the consequences."
It seems Barcelona crossed the imaginary line when she expressed interest in PSG Marco Verratti's back-up this summer.
The PSG made it clear that under no circumstances would it allow the Italian representative to leave, so it is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill in its bold behavior with Neymara’s departure.
Who's gonna explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump said yes to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was doing nothing about North Korea's threat and that it wouldn't go on like this.
It also smells the thought of sanctions like straw from shoes.
You can't put those things in one bag.
Maduro's Venezuela really set off on the road to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is just not acting the way the US President would like it to.
Russia is a chapter to itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even a common voter, American, European or otherwise, could understand what he is and what rule system the sanctions policy is based on, that would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is merely catching up on what President Obama has already prepared, just giving it an implementing stamp.
Then why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump wins the US election, he would hug Putin and call off sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
In practice, it's the other way around.
With Trump, sanctions are not released, but they are tightening up.
But Europe is terrified even more.
German Secretary Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
You mean kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then the EU's anti-Russian sanctions are neither kosher nor kosher.
In turn, European Commission Chief Juncker complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
You mean they're only supposed to use sanctions that are weak enough not to put anyone at risk?
Ordinary voter's in the dark.
For three years, he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Ministries' ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It is now learned that it is the EU's energy security.
The voter's getting deeper.
There are sanctions on Russia for getting too close to where it shouldn't be.
China is being scolded for not installing enough.
The Venezuelan President is being punished for building a dictatorship at his country's borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have their own rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babiš: I do not consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crosses the republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
Apart from the Pardubice Region, he has already completed all the candidates.
According to his words, he did not interfere significantly with them.
He even agreed to be led by the governor and shadow minister of education YES Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Member or a Governor," Babiš confirmed.
You've upset many representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and cities alone, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we are voting directly for the President, and I believe that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about interference, they might as well be there.
The question is, how many will there be?
In presenting your book, what I dream of when I accidentally sleep, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about abolishing the council.
I don't remember.
I was talking about direct choice and reduction of the number of representatives.
New York with a population of nine million has five districts and 51 deputies.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is accused of building little and not preparing big projects, but she doesn't have the authority.
The same is true of a government that only two people, Klaus and Zeman, have run in our history.
Which I'm not saying they did it right.
But the current Prime Minister is not running anything, he's just hosting the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to push through the majority system?
He'd be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
All we have in the program is a one-wheeler vote for the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and a regulation of the House's Rules of Procedure in order to prevent unnecessary exhibitions by Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to demonstrate themselves at the House's meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That, as a dictator, you will govern the government, control the House with 101 Members, abolish the regions and the Senate, and, through grateful mayors and mayors, you will rule the country.
I'm sure it's not like that.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
French President Macron announced a reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 French for one legislator, while in our country it goes to 17,000 Czechs.
But no one blames Macron for the threat to democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the election majority, we have mechanisms to prevent them from making dramatic changes.
But the temptations for those who have a parliamentary majority are great, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no risk of that in the case of the YES movement.
We just need a team to work for the people in the government, not for their parties or resorts.
I do not understand, for example, why we could not agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services would increase.
Why did I get outvoted and added 21 percent to GIBS members who are already taking 60 grand?
Is that what you'd do as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with a travel agency, and for the money of the state they would like to do business like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers aren't supposed to argue in government, they're supposed to argue outside of government.
There's no room for coalition disputes, power votes, and business, that's where the decisions are to be made.
How do you plan to have a cohesive team when ministers are mostly party?
There's a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition treaty did not apply, and fired Babiš from the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a person and has control skills, such false gestures are unnecessary.
They measure everyone equally and require perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you'd suggest for the Treasury Secretary?
I don't even think about it, we probably won't even be in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I did.
There's not that much skepticism.
The mayors have acquired the entrepreneur Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you, with the People's Party he may win the wing of Jiøí Čunek.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out the coalition with ANO, in the ODS may be passed by Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not oppose.
I'd leave it up to the voters.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice-President YES Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of the economy.
So the Occasionals are considered as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it like that.
Mr Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet for Vít Barta for VV, then he got money from Dawn for his company, there was a coup.
Of course, he's a distinct personality.
But it's a little brown.
If I take his program, he's got a wide-ranging involvement in corporate governance, direct democracy, that's something to agree with.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you at gallows demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?
We don't consider working with Mr Okamura, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It'll be about negotiating a winner with a second in a row, but God knows who's gonna be a winner and who's a two.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on a coalition government agenda.
Let's get back to your efforts to run the state like a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go, never made a decision.
Coalition issues like CEB or EGAP didn't work.
I mean, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did, ČEZ dominated the Czech government.
After all, it is incredible that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by ČEZ management, which imposes on the Finance Minister how to vote at the ČEZ General Meeting.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the staffing conditions on the Supervisory Board and replace the top management of CEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm gonna be Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not yet.
It is rumored that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with the ČSSD would like to trade for even better with the YES.
Well, maybe after the election, it'll all go on again.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have a Pokor or Růžička lobbyist, I'm a separate unit, and I don't care about that at all.
Then answer directly.
If you are in charge of the government, will you seek to exchange the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institutions you criticise?
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look up Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although it has a state in CEZ majority, it has never driven it, it was only there to number, which is wrong.
To me, it's a trivial matter.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech Television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't and I have no authority to fire anyone.
But to control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay approximately 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of CEOs of ČT and ČRo.
Look at the way these reports are dealt with, the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from the investigation files and to the lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was stupid enough to let Kalousek push me out of government, which gave him a percentage of TOP 09, but ČSSD took them down.
They're afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, so they're talking about a threat to democracy by Babiš.
Nobody's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first Vice-President of YES Jaroslav Faltýnek builds a power base by putting his son on the Supervisory Board of Teplárny Brno and arranging contracts with municipal and state companies such as Prague Transport Company or České dráhy?
That's where we have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I've blamed him a few times.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Secretary of Finance, I had no one.
Unlike socans, we've never had a corrupt affair, no Pelta, no Kratochvil, no March.
If there was any sign of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I'm uncompromising in this respect.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
