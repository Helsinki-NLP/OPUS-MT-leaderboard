Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco.
The 28 - year - old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim’s brother says that he can’t think of anyone who would want to hurt him, adding: “Finally, he started to succeed. ”
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia, reported to the M.E.'s office.
The San Francisco Police Department has reported that this is a violent death and an investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was a former line cook in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and destroyed" by his death.
“We have a small team that works as a close family. We will miss them very much,” said the spokesperson.
In these difficult times, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first stayed in the hostels, but that recently “he was finally starting to prosper. ”
"He found an apartment, dated a girl," said Louis Galicia for KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any argument.
It was a brother who took things as they are.
"Even if everything else in the world were wrong, he was a diamond that was uncut and irradiated every day," he said.

České dráhy invested over 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier has invested more than CZK 31 billion in the modernisation of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually falling.
České dráhy invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization in the last six years.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money spent was shown to reduce the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic wagons.
A larger share of the investment was placed by the carrier in regional transport, which was about 60 percent of the money, and 40 percent was invested in the renewal of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, modernized older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not calculated, the average age of ČD's propulsion vehicles would increase by 10 years.
On average, passenger cars are slightly older, with an average age of 23 years on the basis of modernisation.
If only the age from the date of production were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33,4 years.
However, in recent years, classic trains consisting of wagons and towed locomotives have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotives from 280 to 223 were reduced, similarly the number of classic wagons from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier disposed of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening while driving.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these vehicles scrapped.
From the investments that ČD plans to make to the fleet in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Praha - Bratislava - Budapest, or the framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic express trains.
The contract provides for the collection of up to 30 motor units and 20 electric units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely helpless, confessing.
For a quarter of a year, the editors of the online daily Aktuálně.cz have been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where it is not only a touristic walk in the treetops, but also an Olympic park.
Highway rangers know it's black, but they say there's nothing they can do about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of similar advertisements all over the country.
Officials say there's a flimsy law to blame, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
A complicated bureaucratic circle is needed first.
In the meantime, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few meters, and the official process has to start over.
The Road and Motorway Directorate admitted three months ago: at the main road from České Budějovice to Lipno, there is an advertising billboard on our property on the national road.
Three months, however, were not enough for officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one cares that they're standing right next to the road in a 50-metre protection zone where nothing can happen for safety.
Road managers say they can't handle a billboard because of a leaky law.
Maybe load him up and get him out of here.
"We must not afford this," says Nina Ledvinová, spokesperson for Road and Motorway Directorate, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be preceded by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began to follow the online daily Aktuálně.cz closely in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot effectively and quickly solve.
In southern Bohemia alone, the editors counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to the road or near it.
There are other regions on the same page.
"We are having trouble getting the companies to remove the banners," says Jiří Klása, head of the Transport Department of the Czech Budejovice Regional Office, whose colleagues solve similar stories.
According to Klasa, there is a leaky law that binds officials.
First, he has to address the billboard owner in a difficult way to put the ad away.
But the leaders of companies are often inadequate or know the trick that Aktuálně.cz described in the past, when he became more interested in the issue: it is enough to move the mobile stand with advertising a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove the black advertising into the basket.
That's because the Bureau has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new device and we must address the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
A new law could bring about a change, which will ban billboards by highways from September next year and will limit them by the I. class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable advertisements will remain the same as they have been.
And the authorities won't be relieved.
Companies can thus continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year in renting illegal areas, and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard that attracts Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the České Budějovice Magistrate currently conducts three administrative proceedings with it for black-posted billboards.
There's a $300,000 fine in every trial.
These are more advertisements that were placed in the protection zone of Class I road without permission.
The proceedings are not yet completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of České Budějovice Magistrate.
The advertising that Aktuálně.cz is interested in is not yet included in these cases, but will most likely be added to them soon.
According to the spokesperson for ŘSD Nina Kidney, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will be put on the table by regional and then probably municipal officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious firms that can't be contacted.
She didn't take over the post office and canceled her official residence in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind her.
In the past, the company's post office went to South Bohemian businessman Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech Hyundai brand representation.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard company rents the space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has rejected any connection in the past.
This spring, when ŘSD became interested in advertising Lipno at the initiative of Aktuálně.cz, Fischer sent a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the company is allegedly newly established.
Even from this address, however, no one has heard from highway managers to this day.
A futile struggle.
Similar silences or opaque changes in residences are not uncommon.
We gradually fined one company for CZK 2 million a few years ago.
But she changed her name and I.C.O., and there was nothing to solve.
The bailiff returned the case, the ads were on, maybe in other places.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, confessing on condition that one of the officials retains anonymity.
No one has yet dealt with the amendment to the law in this regard.
Aktuálně.cz spoke to several Members who were interested in the problem.
But so far, they haven't developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards on the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national but also regional and municipal policies very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they need them themselves for advertising in election campaigns.
I don't have the rather established impression that when something doesn't work, there's a need to change the law.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rape and poppy, they estimate statistics.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the cereal harvest will be 6.7% lower this year than last year.
Yet this year’s crop has exceeded the average for the last five or ten years.
On the other hand, the rape harvest (3.9 percent) and poppy seed (2.5 percent) will be higher.
This year, cereal harvest will be 6.7% lower than last year.
Farmers reap 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is based on an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a decimal drop against last year.
Last year's grain harvest was above average.
This year's crop exceeds the average of the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rape and poppy this year will be higher.
Growers will reap 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they received 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decrease in cereal production is due to both a reduction in yield by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in rotational area.
Farmers have donkeyed three percent less fields this year.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to reap 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers planted it on more fields.
However, a lower yield per hectare will be signed on the decline, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
Roughly one-fifth decline in statistics is assumed by spring barley, which is most commonly used for beer production.
The reduction of the crop is caused by a reduction of 15.2 percent of the rotational area, but also by a lower yield per hectare.
On the other hand, barley of winter will be born 6.3 percent more.
The rye harvest will also grow.
The yield of rape is estimated to be 1.305 million tonnes, which is more against last year.
The area has expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hectar yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rape crop will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, sown on an area a third more extensive than it was ten years ago.
In the last four years, too, poppy fields have been growing.
This year, farmers planted it on 35.543 hectares.
Against 2008, when poppy was grown in the Czech Republic on record 70,000 hectares, there are half fields.
This year's poppy harvest will be richer thanks to the expansion of the rotational areas.
It will rise by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tons against last year.
But the hectar yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
The Olomouc police have charged two men with knife and machete assault, and the court has sent them into custody.
Police charged two attackers who attacked a 35 - year - old man with a knife and a machete in the center of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the victim tried to escape, they caused him severe and cut injuries, which required treatment in the hospital and further treatment," said police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
Both apparent perpetrators were arrested immediately after the attack by police officers.
The prosecutor has filed a court order to take them into custody and the court has complied with him on Friday.
Both men are facing three to ten years in prison.
Police charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him severe and severe injuries, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which took place on Tuesday at noon on the Freedom class, reported by the police.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, informed Olomouc police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
A mass skirmish between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked with a knife and a machete of a 35 - year - old man.
Although the assaulted man tried to escape, they caused him a cutting and cutting injury, which required hospital treatment and further treatment, the police spokesperson said.
In a struggle that attracted a lot of attention in the city centre, and because of which several police patrols and officers had to intervene on the spot, it was a family dispute.
Criminalists accused 34-year-old men from Slovakia and 37-year-old men from Olomouc of attempted serious bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The prosecutor filed a court order to take them into custody and the court approved him on Friday, supplemented by a spokesman.
Machete was used in the center of Olomouc during a mass fight also five years ago, it happened then only a few tens of meters away, before the discotheque Varna in Riegrove Street.
Police then reported that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the establishment who were standing in front of the entrance.
Police say they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two attacking foreigners with conditional punishment.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk by them every day.
One of the loudest examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovážné náměstí.
She should have been a hotel by now.
But there's still nothing.
That there's a need to build new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several apartment buildings, which, despite their location, size and often also monument protection, are deserted and are empty.
We selected properties in the center using the project Emptydomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

Clinton's husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to disclose his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
They donated over a million dollars to Clinton for charity.
Most of the Clinton income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
American Democrats’ candidates for Hillary Clinton’s presidency released their tax returns on Friday, increasing the pressure on their Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, announced AP.
Most of the Clinton income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mainly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s husbands paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, and then a national and local income tax of 9 percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
Trump, however, has a problem with a similar step, has not yet decided to publish a tax return.
There's a chance Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, Clinton tweeted a few minutes after her confession was published.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrets surrounding Trump’s income, including to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims to be, said AP.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower profit would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Caine, who is running as Vice President in tandem with the former First Lady, released a report today on his tax contributions for the last ten years.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their charity earnings and paid 25.6% of their taxes last year.
In Nigeria, polio broke out again.
The Islamists of Boko Haram prevented rigorous vaccination and killed doctors.
Cases of polio have reappeared in Nigeria.
In the north-east of the country, the government has declared an emergency vaccination because two children infected with this disease have been paralyzed.
Vaccines brought in helicopters.
There were Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram in the affected area who defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was circulated undetected.
In the northeast of Nigeria, an emergency polio vaccination will begin because two children were paralyzed there with the disease.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed in Somalia two years ago.
The Nigerian government has announced that millions of children will be inoculated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
On Friday, according to AP, Nigeria’s military helicopters quickly delivered polio vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the virus had circulated undetected for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram have defended vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
On Thursday, their attacks also made it impossible for doctors to reach areas where polio children were detected.
Both disabled toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for polio eradication, Michel Zaffran, told BBC Station that vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long worked in the state of Borno.
The area was only opened to international organisations and the government at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country in a major way.
Nigeria’s health minister Isaac Adewole admitted that new polio cases are a great disappointment to the country because Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio had been eradicated.
The WHO pointed out that although the disease did not appear for two years, it was spreading among the children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, half of all polio cases in the world occurred in Nigeria.
While polio was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now remains in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The pope met ex-prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the emotional stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a pimp gang thanks to the police.
The pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look forward with confidence.
Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking by this meeting and call for an increase in the fight against it.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes in Rome, whom the police freed from the power of the pimp gang.
For over an hour, the head of the Catholic Church listened to the emotional stories of fallen women and then invited them to look forward with confidence, stating the Vatican spokesman.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and one from Tunisia, Italy, and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were subjected to severe physical violence during forced prostitution.
By visiting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for an increase in the fight against him, said the Pope's spokesman.
Francis often draws attention to the fates of people on the fringes of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this April and June due to his personal invitation.
France is going to hit Jihadist factories.
But without the help of the Muslims, it will not work.
Muslims themselves are supposed to help France fight radical Islamism.
Moreover, Prime Minister Manuel Valls’ government is preparing fundamental changes in the functioning of the mosques and the education of clergymen.
Since December last year, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer rooms.
And others will follow, announced by the Home Secretary.
There are over a hundred jihadists in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and mosques.
At the same time, it wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
At the moment, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, most of them from Morocco, Algeria, and the Gulf countries.
Because of this, preachers who can sow radicalism in France also enter the mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should function as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam, founded by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005, now operates in the country.
Already then, the Foundation should have contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon hit by internal contradictions and rivalry.
"It is a total failure," Valls recently said.
After the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate about a new institution was on fire in the French political scene, replacing the dysfunctional foundation.
All has been speeded up by other terrorist attacks in France, carried out by radicalized Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently heard that the new foundation will be established this October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centres.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal foods.
In practice, salesmen would pay halal meals for certification.
Some of this money would then go to the foundation's register.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who will go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them go to a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should operate in mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is in harmony with democracy.
Let's close the Radical Mosques.
At the same time, the French government is in a campaign against radicals.
And others will follow, announced recently by the Home Secretary.
There is no place in France for those who proclaim hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are estimated 2500 mosques and mosques in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled about 80 imam and consider it for several other tens.
But not everyone thinks that government action can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Research Centre.
Dr. Kelemen lost a sprint in the first round to the star of Bauge.
The Czech race cyclist must fight for the advance to the eight-finals in correcting rides.
Drahý cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games after a sprint qualification among the top eighteen lost in the first round a duel with French great Gregory Bauge, champion of silver from previous games in London.
The advance to the eight-finals must be fought in correcting rides.
27 riders stood at the start of the royal discipline on the track, and the best Czech trackman of the present time added the fourteenth best time.
He made a 200 with a fleeting launch in 9.969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase he was thus expected in the qualification of the fifth Baugé, who already has bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
Although Kelemen was in the end harassing an experienced Frenchman, he kept an eye on the procedure.
Great performance flashed to gold defender Jason Kenny.
Eighty-two-year-old Brit has driven the third fastest 200 history and won the Olympic record of 9.551.
He then easily dealt with the last successor, the German Maximilian Levy, as expected.
The British quartet was also successful in the line-up with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50.570 in the 4 km fighter race and advanced to the finals.
To date, the maximum (3:51,659), which belonged to the British four years after the London Olympics, was improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over the new treaty.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the entire board for support for further field events from early September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the issues concerning the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject the contract agreed with BMA.
58% of its members who took part in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday night, Chairman JDC Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained "always silent" on questions, a great deal to reject the contract.
She said: "In this light, the executive authority of JDC decided by voting on the proposed new treaty to reject it completely and to ask for new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board has formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve the running programme of exaggerated sectoral events from early September.
The dispute led young doctors this year to announce to six strikes, including the first general strikes in the history of NHS.
The director of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members at pre-vote meetings before 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the treaty would impose a burden on the medical staff in England.
Russia and Turkey: The alliance of the "unreadable"?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of eight months of a long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart to the luxurious hall of the palace in St Petersburg, I felt that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin did not smile and barely radiate warmth from him, even according to his measured standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke repeatedly about his “Dear Friend” to Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He has also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their level before the crisis, but will be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that emanated from Putin showed that Russia’s leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting down of a Russian combat aircraft by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin was throwing punches around and accusing Ankara of putting a knife in Moscow's back.
The scandal was even greater that it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
State-controlled media has been running a massive campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly it seemed like the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious were the accusations by senior state officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But there was an official message in St Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received the apology he asked of President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared what a victory you also had.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost deprived of power during a failed coup last month, and therefore he needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have obviously shaken it, too.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's sanctions have had a hard impact - particularly the cancellation of charter flights, which transport several million Russian tourists to Turkey's coast each year.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be relieved when flights may be renewed.
They earn money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, public television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey would be allowed again.
“Tourists there, tomatoes back here,” reported a report in the newspaper Leadness.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what she considers to be a poor reaction to an attempt at a coup.
Moreover, the long-standing hostility of lengthy talks about EU accession and Putin's accession - which is eager to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey's ties with the West.
Russia’s leader certainly won bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the elected authorities after attempting a coup.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change, it's a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to demonstrate what one of the analysts described to me as “combining incompatible”: how two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West join forces.
However, despite publicly showing reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently put itself in the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
It could be said that, after almost three hours of opening talks, both presidents at a press conference said that they had not even mentioned this issue.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin chose to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both states could find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster, when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft - it is certainly better that both leaders are talking to each other again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be suppressed into the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Of them, she was relieved when she almost died eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategic brands used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was worth millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Wimbledom Champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not start new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding, will be changed to NatWest.
Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking that get more to the fore - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our trips to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
He said to BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and brand for which our employees work, because we are now becoming a much more branded bank.”
Since the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand and RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts aimed at the home stage.
Each of these brands will mean something quite different in their own communities, and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will not continue its sponsoring of Six Nations Championships, it has prepared a profile of individual brand sponsoring of sports.
"It is a good time for us to move on to the brand bank, because the basic question (which we ask ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had said that we would become a great customer bank and introduced those brands.
But along with the way we focused on customer needs and not our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can remind these marks of the nag, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket riding Predilection led to the 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win in Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins
Joke Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was reached by his second victory of the evening on his local track - on the horse Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden.
Forty-five-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in flat races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
A three-time champion named Dettori, who had won on Ghayyar, said: “It’s strange.”
I'm very touched because my family's here too.
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when after the victory brings Predilection
Two jockeys reached this milestone at obstacle races - champion jock Richard Johnson and 20-time pension champion Sir Anthony McCoy, which during his career breaking records led to the goal of more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern age, and it's no surprise that he's reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
It's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical fistrón that separates it from the other riders in the dragonfly.
He is a fantastic racing ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just go on weekends and big races, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie was driving a winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a living nature, which is good for British racing sport, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous flying jump
From a fleeting finish to a fleeting jump - Frankie Dettori was the messenger of the British plane racing for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
The number of winners of the big races, including his famous "great seven" in Ascot, survived, but he also survived the plane crash and was banned from taking off for drugs.
Three years ago, he was stagnant for the first time, returning after a six-month ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and all the doubters despite returning in the best form.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released Sergei Ivanov's president's office
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from his post as president of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest collaborators for many years.
63-year-old Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “released Ivanov from his service as head of the Russian presidential office,” but there was no reason.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno used to be a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that later he was head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he appointed Putin, he said, "Thank you for your confidence."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the Head of State in the sense of draft laws and control of the extent to which your guidelines are followed.
On Friday, Putin reported to the Russian television station that Ivanov had asked him to relieve himself of his post and recommended that Vajno replace him.
Convince smiles?
This move has completely puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest collaborators and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidency, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast by state television, both men declared that they were leaving the presidency at their own request.
But the smiles on the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once thought of as a possible president yearns to lead Russia’s environmental policy suddenly met with great mistrust.
On the Kremlin’s website, remarks addressed to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012, in an interview, I asked you to entrust me with this very challenging post, even a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I've been head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the position in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as its deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov as one of his five closest collaborators.
At one time, there was even speculation that Ivanov could become the successor to Putin at the head of the state after his second term, because the third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken by another close associate of Putin’s, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, the star of The Thoughts of the Criminal, was released after hitting the director.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS TV stations that produce the show announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before he was fired.
There were creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I am sorry that this happened," he said in the statement.
According to the statements from ABC and CBS TV stations, the details of how Gibson's character disappears from a series that follows the stories of an FBI team of agents a little later.
Fifty-four-year-old actor, who has been famous for the main roles in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has performed in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the ideas of the criminal, and over the last 12 years I have put my heart and soul into them," Gibson said in his statement, which he issued on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could ever have hoped for.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on September 28th.
In Banff, fish mysteriously landed in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish can be sand eels left behind by a storm of water.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a short film of his finding on the Periscope channel, thinking that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeter fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
It is therefore the first of the four caps between the “platform fan” that are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment in building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all seeing construction engineers using over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel on an impressive scale to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
Now more than 79% of the total area of the bridge is in place, the concrete for the last part of the platform is now cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be raised on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure in building each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of the ground building industry.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expansion platform North Tower, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time a very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6,000 tons, and it had to be dragged up about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive”
Three men are "happy to be alive" after being flushed off their fishing boat at Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station announced an alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. on British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued uncut.
"We saw their boat circling near them and we thought the worst of it," said the helmsman of the Moelfre rescue boat Vince Jones.
"Happily, the strong wind drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man 60 years old was found without a life jacket exhausted holding a buoy.
They've all been taken aboard a coastal lifeboat and taken back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and unharmed.
The engine of the ship had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when it was overturned.
Someone upstairs held a protective hand over these guys.
The judge refuses to solve the case because of Fat Man's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three Members who, according to the prosecution, should have received from Prime Minister Nečas and his then cabinet chief Jana Nagyová a political market, a lucrative post for political concessions.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
The schnauzer, Fuksa and the Fat Man allowed him to resign with their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state companies.
That is why they also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, they were wrongfully compensated for almost 2 million crowns.
The fat man is now acting as a witness in the case after the Supreme Court intervened.
His wife works in a courthouse on the Fruit Market and solves civil disputes.
Yet, Judge Helena Královová wants to be careful about criminal matters and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another district in Prague.
The King has already acquitted Jana Nečas twice, previously Nagy.
It was an alleged abuse of military intelligence to track Prime Minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
In this case, the Fat Man didn't figure.
According to Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I do not think impartiality can be interpreted in this way so that the court will rule out the possibility that the Witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge then, he wrote for the diary.
"I think it's crazy," he said.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged with the political market case.
According to his lawyer Petr Toman, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13, the District Court for Prague 1 discussed the prosecution of former prime minister Petr Nečas Jana Nagyová (today Nečasová) and others in the case of abuse of Military intelligence.
In the picture comes Nečasová and her husband to court.
Fatty was supposed to deal with Peroutka's statements.
For example, the wife of the ambassador was to judge the statements of President Miloš Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid by the Allied forces.
She left London Gatwick Airport last February, along with her two equally old friends, to Syria.
The British Interior Ministry did not comment on her death report.
According to police, young Londoners who fled their homes were secretly transferred to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, and Kadiza Sultana, according to the media, headed to their other former classmate from the London school of Bethnal Green Academy.
Last year, the case caused a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria, including 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A hundred thousand-dollar salary dream job.
A well-paid job you don't even need college for.
That's what an I.T. job looks like.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only on Czech conditions extremely high salary (you earn up to CZK 180 000 in IT in Prague), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to the statistics of the staff agency Grafton, the most wanted are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Thus, the candidates are not competing for a job position, but for jobs for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College isn't a necessity.
College education is not a necessity for IT.
Higher education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the candidate's intelligence and education, but it often does not have much in common with knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which will not be replaced by a university, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
Most of the money is in Prague.
I.T. wages are all over the country.
Most of the money comes to them in Prague and Brno, it is no longer such a hit parade in the regions.
"Wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
Technical Directors will be able to make the highest profit.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it will not fall below CZK 80 000.
IT project managers are also requested.
On arrival they can earn 60 000 - 100 000 CZK.
Fighting's about alumni.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this is not true of the IT team.
In fact, if firms are overbid and overpaid by an expert from another company, they will be happy to reach for an alumni.
Because they can raise him their own way.
They can't do without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but it is necessary for I.T. students to have at least decent English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases where companies are looking especially for an educated and experienced person and are satisfied with only the average knowledge of English.
For example, if a support worker has more foreign language, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, he adds Kubačka.
Yeah, in Google, there's paradise.
Only quietly envious can Czech workers work in Google.
Of course for them is flexible working time, possibility of working from home or various abbreviated jobs, not only for mothers.
"The company provides new fathers with four weeks of extra leave after the birth of the child," says Martina Joneková, Google Spokeswoman.
The pampering also involves health care for employees and family, meals, transport, training, wellness or massage directly in the workplace.
Who wants to learn, has a green light, and no matter what new he wants to learn.
But that's not the end of the benefits.
Such a full refrigerator free of charge is certainly not to be thrown away.
A healthy lunch (in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
Moreover, in all the offices of the so - called microcubes, where people always find a healthy snack, the speaker reveals.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, what it doesn't eat is put in boxes that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these on Czech terms of incredible advantages?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shift or development, ideas and innovative solutions," says the spokesperson.
The UN strongly criticized Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
On Thursday, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, United Nations Human Rights Commissioner, accused Bulgaria of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian Government "instigates serious concern about Bulgaria's non-compliance with international law", warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in the statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly disturbing to be seen how important and influential public figures express public support for criminal armed combatants who are brazenly running a hunt for refugees at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross the Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested in an irregular manner," Zeid emphasized.
Worse still, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned for a year or more if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14 000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21 000.
Pokémon Go - a quest for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the last decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time over screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people off couches and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally reduced to TV, later to video games, and most recently to smartphones.
It's great to see that outside technology and activities don't exclude each other.
Of course, I'm talking about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later, a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new game in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The introduction in other countries was postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players on the smartphone go out looking for Pokémon that are tracking through GPS, and when they find them, they can “photo them” (via screenshot on the phone) or “capture” them.
Mania seized the generation that played the game at a younger age, lifted it from the seats and drove it out looking for Pokémon.
This game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps a "average" person takes every day.
The App of Cardiogram for Apple’s Smart Watch, which monitors 35,000 users, recently reported to Washington Post that in two days after the game was launched, the number of people who had been trained for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokémon Go is playing - he sees only rough data about the levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns to "find 30", "get off the couch" and "have been active every day" fell on barren ground, because most of the messages focused on public health are boring and addressed to people who don't look good.
Nevertheless, the importance of the exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity contributes to weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot give here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight.
Some even make new friends in the pursuit of pokémon.
As it happens, of course, there are boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone can walk in the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their time, smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity, but they didn't give us a reason to do anything like this game.
News flashes, and interest in it begins to fade at some point.
Thanks to the success of Pokémon, however, other games will appear that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and will help a number of people in pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles has won gold in the multi-fight of women's gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic jump.
No effort on the beam.
By the plains, they were all speechless.
Excellent at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
Nineteen-year-old American gymnast went straight on Thursday to the title in the multi-combat and overcame the others on the full line under the Olympic spotlights.
The total result 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over the silver medalist and member of the team “Final Fives” Aly Raismanová and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafinová.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during the performance on the beam in the finals of the gymnasts at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row who won the multi-gauge, and fifth overall when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey until now ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of unique athletes of their time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, won 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 gold ones. Her amazing routines are a mixture of ambition and precision, and Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between her and the burden of too great expectations.
Anything other than returning home to your family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be seen as disappointing.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hugs after winning the gold and silver medals in the female multi-fight finals of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was like an exclamation point in the celebration of Martha Karolyi's outgoing national team coordinator.
Biles insists that she never looked forward during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her routine in simple rooms - the one that contains a typical triple flip with a double turn - is set in Latin music that would just fit home, on the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother on her way to the gym, where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The multi-combat competition has not lost since summer 2013 - this is a sequence of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead for a short time with two turns, it was just an illusion.
Hammers and simples - where Biles defends the world championship - await.
She got back in the lead with 15,433 points for the beam - and finished with 15,933 points in the plains.
Raisman hugged her gently, waiting for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glittering red, white and blue shadows, Biles appeared tears when she fulfilled the wishes she had once written in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was kind of payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared a third place with Mustafin, but then she eats bronze for the sum of the three best sets.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who Americans call "grandmother," was way ahead.
After her simple rooms, she sent air kisses to the crowd, overcome by a return that at times seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the contribution that this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where she became a total hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women and a 12 - year - old girl died during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix, and were shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities have reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis Maleah's daughter were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
The report states that the armed man was standing on the side of the passenger and fired eight shots from the handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
Police say it's not robbery that's worth a triple homicide, because the attacker didn't take his wallets, or the amount of $2,900 that one adult victim had on her.
Police spokesperson in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators were checking to see if the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
A total of nine attacks took place in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods within four months, killing seven people and injured two others.
"This is happening in the residential area in front of the houses," Howard said earlier this month for the KPHO branch of CBS.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late '90s, a black BMW from the late '90s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Linero (31) and Ellis Maleah's daughter died on the scene.
The Witness told the police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which was targeted by an empty van just half an hour before the triple homicide.
Investigators found shell casings and bullet residue in the seat and put a bullet under the hood of the engine.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephalia: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and of course also his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephalia, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are prepared for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund may never know them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be institutionalized.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do that anymore," explains Picciutová.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he's still not talking.
Some of the milestones are already slowly filling up.
He goes with the help and rides his bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth is performing sign language, using which Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciutová for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as is the case with Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary significantly.
It's too early to tell us how the Zika virus will affect the lives of the infected.
Picciutová recalls the emotional toll that the uncertain future takes.
I keep asking, "What happens next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the general prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to be able to tell me.
But Picciutová has an encouraging message for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
You know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, and more rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after extreme rainfalls, a number of rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and southern Mississippi will spill from their shores and face widespread floods.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that civil servants are constantly in contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's office for national security and crisis preparedness, said they were receiving requests for vehicles to ride in the water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said he only asked Tangipah County for 10,000 sandbags.
Flood patrols will continue to work until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
The Meteorological Service stated that it can rain over the sea for about 8 to 13 more centimerts.
In southern Alabama, the flood patrol was on standby on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of Mobile.
According to the forecast, the Comite Rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are to culminate this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said they both said they could flood a number of houses in the suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that floods downstream in the Ascension district were a danger, when these floods would only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, a little further south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest recorded levels on Friday at 9 a.m.
Paramedics are still picking up people from the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among the protected at Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said his other stepson, who lives nearby, alerted him.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it all the way to my waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever experienced on a creek in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all of his family are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that crisis workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of heavy rains, the floods are “stupidly spreading” and the authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rainfall fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been soaking heavily since Wednesday.
The authorities stated that heavy rain and paid trips required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and the cancellation of teaching in five school districts.
According to the Elder of Tangipaho, 200 homes were flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals trapped by high water.
In Amite and Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water begins to fall," he said.
More than 20 streets were closed in the Tangipaho district of Hammond because of the flood, and locals were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had the last big flood here in March," said the manager of Lacy Landrum.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, a crisis manager in Harrison, Mississippi, said that persistent rain continued on the Gulf Coast.
He said a couple of houses were being flooded on Thursday, but none of them showed up on the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot to death", survived a shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week it's the second shooting at a child 6 years of age in the city.
His grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahai Brown.
Grandparents say that the boy suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including weaknesses, legs, arms, and abdomen, but was conscious while transporting to the hospital.
"He took a lot, his little body was shot through like a rat," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez, to the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and underwent several surgeries.
The station's family said the boy should get better.
He was supposed to be in primary school first class.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, there are two other victims in stable condition.
According to the station's report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia reported that there was probably a shootout between several armed men.
There were shell casings found at the scene from assault-type weapons belonging to various assault-type weapons.
Apparently, it was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
It seems, therefore, that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," said the police captain Anthony Ginaldi for the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No one's been arrested, and the police are supposedly looking at video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm with a stray bullet on Tuesday in front of a house in West Oak Lane.
The girl's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is how I picture the women's gymnast team for this year's Olympic Games for several reasons.
First of all, I've been at every summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And two, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also consolidated the presence of black women and Latin women at the top of this sport.
The number one gymnast in the past four years has been African-American.
Simone and Gabby were in the first and second place last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became a champion of the Olympic Games, and America rejoiced.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of the three-time world winner Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who demonstrated unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American who won gold in the female multi-combat of individuals.
And team member Aly Raisman got the silver.
We're witnessing a sports peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country, it doesn't look like it.
Simon, Gabby and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnast team for the next Olympic Games will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastic clubs that keep parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their wards and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, both trained athletes at the time they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics trainings that are more accessible and accessible to communities of countless young girls who have inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer gymnastics for free or at low cost in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (especially black and Hispanic) and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, achievements at school and at work.
It's the inspiration this team will send to us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing the "girl strength" and winning the Olympic team gold, and thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter the next strike.
The ministers hoped that after concluding the revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be an end to disagreements over changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt revealed in July plans to enforce the contract, with NHS being in "nobody's land" and further delays having a damaging impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend working procedures in order to improve care in non-social hours.
Doctor Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Committee for Young Doctors, stated last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis will increase and thus fair treatment of all doctors. ”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under the new treaty, progress is needed and time is running out.
The efforts of the BMA to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with a reluctance to involve Dr and often with deafening silence from the government.
And that despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, press for enforcement and resolve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, as nurses and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after concluding the revised agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be disagreements regarding changes.
BMA wants higher payments for work on the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, called on young doctors not to enter any strike.
Mortimer said: “Only a little or nothing will be achieved by selecting an action, but pressure will be placed on already overloaded teams and services, and fears, exhaustion and disruptions will increase for patients, caring staff and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have dealt with the advice of young doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health, and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as utilization, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after career interruptions, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health took the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A 60-kron medicine a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs about 60 crowns (two pounds) in conversion.
The blood clotting medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of relapse in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now given for 12 months after having had a heart attack in order to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that people be given the medicine for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fat that forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is separated, blood clots, blood access to the heart, and heart attack can be blocked.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, block the blood supply to the brain, and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another seizure.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely.
The proposal for a NICE directive published today recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Review Centre, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of those who have had a heart attack and who suffer another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences. ”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased to be able to extend the treatment options available to many thousands of people who can benefit from it in the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrel - above all the risk of bleeding - over three years is limited, treatment beyond this time is not recommended in the proposal.
With computer culture began to flourish fraud in Muslim regions
The mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was suspended from office last year because of corruption, which was linked to the government's report
The culture of political correctness has led to the neglect of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, now stated in the government report.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises the police, electoral inspectors, and city hall for ignoring the abuse of voters because of “the sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidating voters based on their religion was so bad that police should make cordons and protect them from the polls.
He recommended that voters take with them an identity card so that they could prove who they were at the election.
At present, voters just need to state their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to apply indelible ink on the fingers of persons when submitting their voices in order to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It requests that the press be given greater access to documents from meetings and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not just about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets, West London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his post after charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically intervened" in the religious sense of his Muslim community and silenced his criticisms with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, in his words, “led his campaign so that it would be a religious duty of devoted Muslims to vote for him. ”
Up to 300 votes have been called into question or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and gives himself up to someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the frauds in the correspondence vote - which it is claimed that the older members of the Muslim community, during which he put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, on the photo, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
His report states: “ Proof has been provided that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
"There was a concern that... state institutions closed their eyes before such behavior because of the "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondence voices to prevent “the extraction of votes.”
The report now being evaluated by Theresa May also asks for more thorough checks on registrations in order to prevent the use of election lists for immigration fraud and benefit fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to present an identity document before the vote.
Using indelible ink on people's fingers in voting to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to a period of three years.
Disable political agitators and activists from tampering with surrendered correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordons around the polls.
Change laws to make it easier to prosecute people who exert illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Disable taking photos in the polls.
Require only English (except Wales) to work in the polls.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to electoral booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says that it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election trial expelled Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of evidence of a crime.
It also criticises the unsuccessful "checking of checkboxes" in the voters' registration departments at the city hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s judgment in the Tower Hamlets case was awakened.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some institutions threaten this reputation.
Infatuation by cycling doppelganger Duchess Kate and other doppelgangers famous at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Olympic Games in Rio have become crazy about the French cycling woman Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is even strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only gold-seeking athlete this year, who can boast of her own double from among well-known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the famous personalities currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians, more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
Like game hunting: A member of the American archers team Brady Ellison (left) has been likened since childhood to Leonard DiCaprio
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the bike track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of the star Leonard DiCaprio.
A racer from a team of American archers, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures appeared that resembled a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed media madness and admitted that he had heard of his similarity with Leo since he was a kid.
"He sees no similarity of himself, except perhaps the beard," said Brady for the Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be emphasized even more this year: the striking resemblance between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for several years to the star of Gell Matthew Morrison.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan with an "athletic version" of the actor from the movie Origin (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russia's silver swimmer, Yulia Efimov, boasts not only the same brown skin and blonde hair Annalynne McCord has, and Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, fans say he looks like the "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Able women: Hope Sol’s star football (left) and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter’s (right) have a similar face and eyes shape
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarities
On Waves Theory: According to this user there may be a reason for similar appearances of pairs
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are in truth identical.”
The football star Hope Sol and the actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter really have an incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to Laura Linney's smile, or the gold medal holder of Gabby Douglas's gymnastics, proud of her wonderfully wide smile, which seems to copy Gabrielle Union's smile, the stars of Bravo, girls!
The CBC Olympic announcer apologizes for saying that she "exploded" about a Chinese swimmer.
A 14-year-old Ai Yanhan commentator Byron MacDonald outraged the viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympic Games at CBC.
Canada’s CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “took off like a stink” and “exploded” during the race.
NARRATOR Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone had been turned off when at the end of the women's relay finals at 4x200 meters free style he began to spout his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "resurrection" to the CBC commentator team, said: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Too excited, dragged like a stink, exploded.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in time 1:57.79 - i.e. 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to drag China.
Spectators in Canada quickly began to speak online and were horrified by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted on Twitter: “Did the reporter at the CBC say that a 14 - year - old swimmer from China “exploded?”???
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China in the finals of the women's relay race at 4x200 meters freestyle was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism came on Twitter from all sides, and many have requested his appeal.
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC, apologized for MacDonald's live commentary and said: "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped on the air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-commenter Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and put their apology into the answer for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the comments of commentator MacDonald
The station also apologized quickly and published a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, she shouldn't have gotten on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and those watching us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments concerned the performance of a swimmer, not a swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon Byron MacDonald apologized on live TV and tried to explain his comment by claiming that he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the news from the Olympics at CBC station.
"I meant the performance of a swimmer and not the person of a swimmer as such."
"No need to say that I had no disrespect and I am very sorry."
Customers in Primark outraged by a woman who shamelessly tried on her underwear in the middle of a store
When the woman took off her clothes to try on her panties in the middle of Primark, the shoppers were not sure which direction to look.
To make matters worse, she tried to fit her size, took her panties off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and finally tried four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
Primark shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her panties before returning them to the shelf.
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that the mystery woman, after trying on her underwear, “redressed and left the store without buying anything. ”
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, cheeky like a monkey."
"Everybody just stared at her pants being undressed again, and apparently she didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, got dressed again and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was watching - nor did she think of the person who might have bought the panties she was trying on."
Miss Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else was wearing and that nobody cleaned them.
The event occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: “When she left, I collected things that she clearly tried to pull away from the sale - which is also the only right thing to do. ”
"I would be terrified to bring home new panties and find out that another woman was wearing them, took them off and that they weren't washed."
A spokesman for Primark said: “Primark knows about the incident at our shop in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9. ”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sales.
How to defend against weapons attack using Krav Maga
The world out there is dangerous, but with this video from Dailymail.com, it might be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York City, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly overtake the rapist, whether he approaches you from the front or from the back.
If they approach you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a clear runway of the missile".
Then you grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a loose elbow.
Then the knee goes into the groin, and while the attacker squirms in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit the main man in the face and start retreating, holding the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body off the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so the scoundrel can't shoot.
At the same time, put force into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon from its grip and start retreating while still aiming at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video, where you will see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But don't forget that the safest way to get out of an ambush - unless you're the Grand Master of Krav Maga - is to release all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
The British traveler decided to put his immune system and gag reflex to severe testing by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and author of travel books Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, to prove the strength of his immune system he licked with his tongue a euro banknote, railing on Piccadilly Circus, flush button on the toilet on the train and Russian public phone.
He used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flusher button on the train, which thousands of other people have used, may seem utterly repugnant, but there are in fact many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Ian Wright talked to doctors and health specialists throughout Europe about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked left him with anything worse than an aftertaste.
Ian Wright became famous by testing the resistance of his intestines on the road around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely - from public railings at train stations to flushers
In a film about it, he says: “I haven’t cared much about my health since I was a child, and I put everything in my mouth, from dirt to worm eating and muddy water. ”
He certainly confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused were the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
To compare, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made an Traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom
In the film, he said: “This is almost the most disgusting thing I have ever felt in a toilet. ”
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in cooperation with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acids and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen intestinal bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that they would watch with interest and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of the stuff I wanted him to do - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the movie."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others pretty hard.
I'm glad we licked some of that dirty stuff."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and gut health, and 58 percent of respondents said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lactic acid.
The family of socially needed before eviction destroyed the municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall
A family of socially needed people left £50,000 in damage to their community home after being charged with terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from the house, the residents of the housing cooperative were shocked to discover that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, floor coverings were torn, garbage was lying all over the floor, and the walls were scribbled.
The family has already moved and is believed to live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned about whether she was going to save the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for the people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
There are a number of circumstances that need to be considered, because this property is likely to become known as the "not so nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
A couple of them have three sons who occasionally stayed in the house, and the police said that the terror that the family used was street fights using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding population, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screaming, fighting and swearing.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned on the lease contract, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, stinking garbage was found.
In the house from which drugs were distributed in the past, there was torn out floor coverings
Neighbors say they were seen fighting in the street, and people called the police here regularly.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they were given an additional period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
The relief neighbors welcomed the eviction that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said: “They didn’t care about anyone at all. ”
We lived next door for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times have we seen the police here, they can't be counted.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredibly quiet - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a neighborhood supervisor for Cornwall Housing, reported that the family failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, police were regularly summoned to the house
Garbage and old toys lay in the overgrown part of the village house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant was unable to accept responsibility for her own behavior and for that of her family. eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, must have scared her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community who bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time convey the message that we will not tolerate antisocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of the tenants' sons who lived in a house at different times were about 20 years old.
A polluted mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after eviction
Workers will now have to remove piles of garbage that have been dumped around the house.
In 2014, the police raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of a class B drug she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was meant for the foundation of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her eviction partner are now believed to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they're going to try to evict tenants who violate the rules of their lease agreements.
Angela Crowe of Denov and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear message for other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior and will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after a low flight of a military jet over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun’s rays in Portuguese Aveir were terrified to death
Portuguese Air Force Air Force P-3C Orion was flying incredibly low.
The military air force said it was a training flight, and insisted that safety was not compromised.
The moment a low-flying jet descended over a crowded beach, frightened tourists panicked.
Dramatic shots show how a military plane reaches almost a touch of the sun on a sandy beach near Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of jet engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted video recordings of a dramatic flight on social networks, said: “The plane flew twice really low, and at one point it seemed to crash. ”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head. ”
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a low-flying plane appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight in order to identify the fishing boats off the coast and had to withstand low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft reportedly flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the air force insists that the safety of people was not compromised.
Forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer and claimed four victims on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to dense fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boat as part of the training.
Half the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half the funeral service providers fail to comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (ČOI) found this during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services do not most often inform survivors of their prices or do not issue written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The ČOI imposed 41 fines for this total value of 73,000 CZK.
Today, Jiří Fröhlich, her spokesman, reported this.
Inspectors found fault with 47 out of 95 inspections.
In addition to non-information on prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified gauge.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This concerned urn covers, candles and vases that were not properly labelled with mandatory information.
"Since there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the audit action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Counsel Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned of her death in the Syrian Racca a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that it was probably killed during a Russian air attack in Racca, which is the bastion of a group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family she died just as she was preparing to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"Man wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone - is that they will discourage people from ever making a decision," said Akunjee.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that in Syria she married an IS fighter - and within a few months she became a widow.
Reid says if Clinton gets elected, she'll leave Garland as a Supreme Court candidate.
The Senate leader for the Democratic Party, Harry Reid, says she believes that the candidate for the presidential election for the Democrats Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
The Senate majority leader Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the deceased Supreme Court judge will elect the future president.
During the conference call on Thursday, Reid stated that she believed that Clinton would choose Garland "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid’s spokesman later stated that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether or not she would nominate Garland and that he was speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "swing the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is chairman of the federal appeal court in Washington.
Reid said that Republicans blocking Garland's appointment were "servants" and "servants" of the Republican candidate for Donald Trump's presidency.
He said Trump wasn't good for office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars are for "women and men"
The magazine Treats works closely with photographer David Bellemer for the 2017 calendar, inspired by Pirelli from the 1970s.
But instead of exposing well-known personalities, NU Muses is trying to find the next generation of top models for his 2017 calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We must return to depicting timeless and classical nudity, when women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of a woman's body," Shaw said in a press release of the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who actually buys gramophone records?
Vinyl is loved by middle-aged lonely men.
Before you decide to overwhelm the comment section with perky notes under the pseudonym Not All Lonely MenIn the Middle Ages, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, so many discussed resurrections of gramophone records are associated not with the boom of milliennials, who want to enjoy the originality of ownership of a physical object, but with middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people 18-24 are the least likely.
It is not really about massing a enthusiastic fan - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to want to retain their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog had been broadcast as a TV story, I would have been watched by a camera heading out to a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesturing widely. Then I would have stopped, pulled out my hands and said something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at it."
So let's take a look.
While Soho is slowly disappearing from the heart of his charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent vendors, hotels, restaurants and canteens, equipment and office supplies are now filled with fantastic special record stores.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while.
Stuart (55), a native from Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and is looking at shops to fill several hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got, like, 3,000 or 4,000 recordings.
All the recordings line up the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he e-mailed me the photo, I didn't follow it home).
This huge amount of albums and singles is also available because they can afford it: they can now buy gramophone records that they couldn't afford when they were originally coming out, and they buy again what they sold when they were young and they didn't have any money.
"Many of what I buy is from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These are things that would have been published when I was 11 or 12. I was too small and couldn't get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy recordings are likely introverts who like the company of themselves, adding: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that the number of customers he meets fits the profile of YouGov.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old gramophone records.
According to my interviews, most of the people were getting rid of their collections between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their record records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their record records back," he says.
This could explain the boom of phonograph record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of gramophone records?
It will not take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that you will find a pleasant association of people with similar thinking in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
Some gramophone record fans may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of gramophone record covers, things that bring back memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think filling in the gap or owning something material can bring some comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, that's the way it is with me, and I think a lot of people are, too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We are all like their social workers!” says the collaborator from a pile of gramophone records.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of the respondents have a gramophone that they never use, while 7% of those who buy gramophone records do not have a gramophone.
At this point in the story, he probably seemed very concerned about going through a pile of compilation bossa nova.
The aspect of "trophesy" and the revival of interest is something Jonny noticed (42), who works at the Sounds of the Universe.
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a gramophone yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead so we can display it on the shelf," he says.
The percentage of such is not large, but it does happen.
It's more about the product side than it is about music.
People come to us and say, "I don't have a gramophone."
These are younger people, not the older ones, the grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for gramophone records, has much more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There are 70-year-old couples, tourists who take pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the stores before - instead of the pulling jazz, the latest Wild Beasts pop, full of synthesizers and sex, is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but you can't guess the pervasive mental trauma when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) takes a few minutes in Fopp walking through and viewing various gramophone records on sale.
She's one of those people who's more of a window-seeker than a spender.
According to her words, she doesn't make much money, so there's no way she collects gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but gramophone records have their charms... "He sighs longingly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a shop that allegedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans and I watch a group of teenage girls flocking around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's turntable.
On the left is the staircase, whose wall is covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's gramophone records: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average record collection.
No one looks at them - maybe just because they're only for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's a purely "vinyl trick."
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depths of Soho for others, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is more likely time and money than in other areas, is also the one where it spends the most on the most luxurious goods that vinyl is.
But while, according to my findings, the results of YouGov seem to be accurate - at least in record stores, they do not take into account a large number of collectors and lovers of vinyl who actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
I'm sure he doesn't spend Thursday morning wandering around the record stores on Berwick Street, going through recordings and avoiding the strange, 30-year-old fake TV host who hides behind the back of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video reportage
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
According to Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and is five metres long.
The court in France refused to tear down shops in the jungle refugee camp
The court in France rejected the order of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 interim shops where people in the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea for 50 cents or basic meals for several euros.
The prefect’s office in Calais argued that places must be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations in court have stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-supported associations and other groups do not add food to the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Controversial interim shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille Court held that there was no legal basis to prevent people from doing 72 temporary business, but stated that Prefect Calais’s objections were ‘completely understandable’.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants play a much greater role than simply serving food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said that the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by demolition was the camp café, Jungle Book Kids, which is run by a nonprofit organization, offering 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum counseling for hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people signed the petition to protect the “child” café.
The Guardian received a letter saying that closing the café “would be a disaster for these children, some of them only 8 years old. ”
The charitable organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the numbers of refugees in the camp have increased to over 9,000 during the summer - which is the most in the whole time so far.
He thought he was dead.
Ulch is raising himself and volleyball Ústí.
"Since March I could train normally," he reported at the start of the summer preparation in full strength.
What were you up to?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, then a heart problem.
Because when I was at the university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, nobody found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when the weather's working or changing.
But nothing that limits me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you afraid for your life?
I did.
Last year at the Summer Tournament in Woodens, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move anymore.
I threw up blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, and I was completely wiped out for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Wooden House, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else before.
How'd you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just gonna go up.
I know I have some blood issues, I have to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But there's nothing we can do about it.
Only when I wanted to return to the preparation of Příbrami last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I knock, physically I'm better off than I was before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I look forward to it, the gang looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about two more strangers coming.
I hope we sit down humanely to make it work for us.
Are you going to lift the mouth?
It had a reputation for beating up, but every season is different.
Brno was eight two years ago, now it's second.
There's a new team in Ústí. There's only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extra league, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
Once we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see who gets beat up after the first rounds, we won't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's been through a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last place.
But my coming here wasn't related to him, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a great friend with one and it was agreed that he would work here.
I'm not gonna say a name.
Finally, Mr Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for decades, he's a good old player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to tease, and I like to get an opportunity on a not-so-high team.
I've been in Příbrami for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being on the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a foreigner. He's already training Australian Boehm in Ústí.
What does he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in a group at the university.
And we've had a few conversations there, sometimes we've been sitting together after the fights, so we know each other friendly.
We beat them at 3:1, immediately at the start of the summer preparation in Ústí I gave it to him.
He's got a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze are still arriving.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been texting with an American, he seems like a nice guy, Brazilian, who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm the tape recorder, so I should be communicating with everyone.
Right away, I was checking out who the players were, I looked up on the Internet playing, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the guy jumps, he's tall.
We posted a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'd fit in.
How are you looking forward to being number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'm 24 years old and I don't have the nature to take turns.
I'd rather be at the center of things, I'd rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I don't think I'd want to play anymore if I was gonna be like a second taper and do it in full time. When something's not done to the fullest, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Six months in Pribram, when Kust couldn't do it as captain, he got hurt, then there was money trouble, and he left.
We've been climbing since then, and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, whose offspring I was, I changed the number one and the number two.
It was an excellent year in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and chose Příbram.
That's where Budejovice wanted me, and I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a fresh start.
Gold number 22.
The short location box remains Phelps domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," laughed Phelps while his eyes were full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother were cheering again in the audience, son Boomer this time slept peacefully with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started swimming in a race, and in a few hours, it'll all be over, he said, moved.
In the finale behind Phelps, nearly two seconds later, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long positioning machine.
Bronze won Chinese Wang Shun, bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championship.
After Al Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distance) Michael Phelps is the third athlete who mastered the same discipline on four games in a row.
For most of the race, another American named Ryan Lochte and the home of Thiago Perreira were led by Phelps.
While the defender of the gold in the final kraulařská's 50 put on a crushing finish, they fell off the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the ceremonial announcement of the positioning position, he advanced to the finals of the race to 100 meters of butterfly.
The legend could not be overshadowed by the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the signing double - after a hundred won both in Rio and twice the track.
In the final, he left behind 37 hundredths of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, and the third was the Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While Murphy only has a fifth place in the 200s from last year's World Cup, he became signmaster king in Rio.
He took Larkin from the imaginary throne, who succeeded in the same double at last year's World Championship.
But he won a medal at the Olympics just now.
On the 100 of them, Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel shared the gold.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuelová the second after the silver of the relay.
She won swimming gold at OH as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sport becomes love for them, and they get to where I am, said touched Manuel.
The third was the Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-meter butterfly race in Rio in the world record and still has silver from the 250-year-olds.
Until the sixth world record is over, Australian Cate Campbell.
Japanese Rie Kanet won the 200 breast trade, for which it is the first Olympic medal in 27 years.
It has no precious metal from the World Cup, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Rusk Julija Jefimov, who, due to the start of the games despite the doping past, is struggling with the hostility of the spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should answer those questions all the time.
I'm so tired of it, she said Russian swimmer.
The right to launch in Rio was acquired only at the special panel of sport arbitration CAS just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
If anyone likes it or doesn't like it, or if he has a different opinion, let him turn to the arbitration court, she added.
Disappointment, we could have won.
And the start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
It was less than an hour before the match that they learned who they were going against.
They must have mastered tactical training.
And then, in an unusual time, the game began on a small court number one.
The first set didn't start well, then they got the lead of the rivals, but they couldn't handle the endgame at 19:19.
In the second they were clearly better and leveled, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
In particular, a number of broken service was a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," Hermann regretted.
How would you rate the game?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start, before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
At the end of the last balloon, I lost my income, which I had gotten used to before.
We lost the set, which was crucial.
In the next set we started on them with an overview on the field, a different defense and pushed on the service.
There's been a really bad serve in the tie-break, and that's where we took this side down.
It was disappointing because we could beat the Russians.
It's too bad we missed the start of the first set.
We were able to download it, but we missed the points.
The second set was great, and in the third, he decided the service.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was about those five points, and we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in small yard number one?
Sluková: Similar to China in the side yard.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock at night, total silence, music not playing, nothing.
That was different from the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
How was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the rivals an hour before the match?
- She was special.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn't make tactical preparations like the other teams.
But Simon (the coach of Nausch) prepared a tactic for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of papers prepared with tactics, so we were pretty well prepared on this side.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
- I don't think so.
We played at 10:30, but not 12.
Ruska Birlov's block in the playoffs for the Ohio Olympics in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermannová in a hug at the pre-round playoffs at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group since 10, we had the mode shifted earlier.
That was two more hours.
It's funny, I can't imagine any other sport has athletes who have to give their best performance at 12 o'clock.
But I think we've done the best we can.
We knew it would be, but it's not really typical, and it probably won't be my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the progress from the group was our goal, it's okay on the one hand, good.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Sluková: I'm going to sleep it off, and tomorrow I'm going to remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big brother's here, here comes the first peeping SIM.
You can't escape it.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who choose to buy a SIM from one of the local operators when staying in Thailand.
Thus, not only for tourists, but also for persons with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or marry there.
The Secretary-General of the Office of National Broadcasting and the Telecommunication Commission, Takorn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The sales plan for SIM intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The authorities intend to implement new measures to enable their location to be monitored within six months.
According to Tantasith, this is a means of maintaining national security that will allow foreigners to deal with the crimes committed by the people.
The so-called tourist SIM is also intended to help detect persons who exceed the permitted length of stay.
Special SIMs for foreigners should appear at the side of the SIM intended exclusively for Thais within six months.
The difference will be the monitoring function, which will be permanently turned on for cards intended for persons without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to shut it down.
"This feature is not for Thais with SIM, because we can always track them easily," added Tantasith.
It must be added that prepaids in Thailand are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller shall require an identification document.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators handed out a free start SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are also considering the introduction of the same measure as Thailand.
They are also currently subject to mandatory SIM registration, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not require foreigners to purchase a local operator when entering the SIM country.
They can of course use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
After crossing the border, i.e. after signing in the SIM to their network, the operators of the country know only relevant network information.
They therefore know the telephone number, but not the owner’s information.
However, the difference between roaming prices and rates of local operators is so dire that most tourists start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to supervise the movement of foreigners by foreigners living in Thailand have legally received immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and compares the upcoming system with the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents in connection with privacy protection.
Moreover, police will need a court order if they need to monitor a particular person.
Any abuse of the system will be subject to an unspecified penalty.
"If the service provider monitors the location of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
Moreover, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a particular number is currently recycled only after the 90-day period after which the SIM did not sign up to the network, the number could be renewed after 15 days in case of leaving Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We've been looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property will be taken care of by the manager.
The condition was enough parking space and elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking floors, high energy intensity and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
More interesting visitors can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Poláková from Artigo studio.
Why did you just call them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to everyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone, if it is designed from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of possible materials and are able to match the interior accordingly based on the client's wishes.
We worked with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, then based on personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-residential space with adequate background for a four-member family conceived as a modern but not cool interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment to the terraces and implement intelligent household control.
And, of course, the quality of the execution had to be monitored.
Have you left everything to the experts, or have you intervened in the final form of the interior?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and material samples, but the design always came from architects.
In the beginning, we set out what we expect from design and showed some interior elements that we would like to include in the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it was our collection of mostly Czech authors including the works of Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund that helped the architect to navigate our taste.
The combination of black, white and walnut wood was also an architect's idea as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc.We then tested whether everything together by visualization.
Were there any complications in the implementation of which you had to give up your original ideas or, on the contrary, agree to a new one?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction at the moment when it was possible to ascend to the height of our floor for the first time, and found that the views we had planned were actually shielding the surrounding buildings.
That's when we literally changed the layout overnight.
Granite was used on the kitchen counter and on the lining of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces supplemented by leather, such as the upholstery of dining and bar chairs by the Arper Standard.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you making any changes, or is there something you would like to have differently today?
I believe it is a modern air interior, which primarily serves its purpose.
We are not planning changes, most of the modifications after moving took place in the plane of shielding and housing terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor, when the walnut wood appears to be too delicate for the house with the dog.
Word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, therefore it was possible to make completely new layout and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior is an important element of placing sun tunnels in the hall ceiling and the main toilet.
This gave us daylight in the darker spaces of the apartment.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally Algerian.
I was born in the south of France, not far from the Spanish border.
I've been moving around a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which helped me to get a job in a magazine.
Then why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel suffocated in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought every Frenchman was so negative.
People in France are in a negative mood in general, but it's gotten worse lately.
It's interesting that you mention negativity.
Some people evaluate the Czech nature in this way.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel that way when they come to France because they are not so aware of it as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
Money is a big issue.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is EUR 1 500, which I think is enough.
And now there's a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, on the street I lived in, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look at me through his fingers just because I was Muslim.
Like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job, basically, anywhere else, and I ran into an opening at Air France here in Prague.
I'll admit I didn't know anything about Prague at first.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially for a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't pick up any negative reactions or swearing, but I feel like people here are more free.
That I could do anything, dress in any way, and no one would judge me.
In France, you're always uncomfortable looking at you, like when you're wearing special clothes and stuff.
In Prague, I began to feel really free.
I don't think the Prague people care about that sort of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
After that, a friend and I set up a website where people offer and search for shared housing.
So far, we only operate in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs from half, and two other friends of Czechs.
I must say that the other specific thing about Czechs is that at first they keep more distance.
They won't let anyone near you.
That's quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on their cheeks.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you didn't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is easy enough in Prague because everyone here speaks English.
Even in curfews or in foods.
I'd like to learn English, but I don't have that much time.
And because everyone can communicate in English at least a little bit, I don't need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you experienced any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're Muslim?
Basically, no.
Perhaps this is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
I can think of one experience.
My leader, the Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They are not French, they are Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But that someone would have a problem with me being a Muslim, that's never happened to me before.
Even though my colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown and be called names.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid, for example, that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen anywhere these days.
Until recently, I could not imagine something like this happening in France.
And it's not just about the Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognise violence at all.
To me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill, because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists defend themselves with your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow those reports of violence, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met in the square of Jiří from Poděbrady.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims together with Christians demonstrated against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But the way I see it, these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
For example, my coworkers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam, because we all see it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, they maybe learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with a woman's subordinate position.
How do you feel about that?
There's no way I'm being subordinate.
It's the other way around.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It has to do with the fact that you don't wear any headgear.
Like a hijab?
And the way I was raised is mainly signed on it.
My mother, for example, is a truly principled Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is purely personal.
It all depends on how she interprets it.
When one reads the Koran, one should make an opinion of those things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, for example, where the scarves require, I will take it.
Do you plan to stay in Prague?
For now, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I feel great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
I think Prague is the ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
Sailor Kozelska Fenclová wind in Rio blew on the forward rungs.
On Friday ́s sea rides in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, Czech sailor Veronica Kozelské Fenclová was released.
In Laser Radial class she moved to 10th place before the final two races.
This would ensure that the Czechs participate in the final race.
You'll collect the packages like pokémon.
They want to compete with the transporters.
The idea to use already planned transport routes is based on television director Matěj Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
They breathed life into three applications with different geographical ranges.
We started the national app in May.
At this point, there are thousands of cities in it, and we will expand the network.
We want to learn this first in the Czech Republic before we focus more on foreign countries, says in an interview for iDNES.cz, a forty-one-year-old manager.
How do I transfer applications work, and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data on how much you can transport and how much you want for it.
Maybe someone's asking for transport on that day again.
When the route and the time of delivery are in order, it is paired together and the mutual notification will come to both of them.
That's when the cabin opens, where the couple arranges a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register to always find their courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't guess how many registered and how many routes it takes to make the coverage absolutely optimal and each offer paired with demand.
It's already working on the main moves, and it's logically easier than on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
So far, people are building confidence and finding that no one can escape with the package.
You haven't had to solve a case like this yet?
How many users does the service have after two months of launch?
At the moment, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people who make the roads.
We consider this a success and we believe that others will be packing up.
Is there any chance that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to be competition for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the matter the same day and at a fraction of the price.
You'll pay several thousand for delivery at the big company within two hours.
Here, you'll pay a hundred or less, because that's the road someone's already taking.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the potential loss of customers in the future?
We hope that's the case.
The market has huge potential, there are huge multinational carriers feeding here, as well as trade chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually discovered that quality is not what they pay for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox that says to pick up the package at the branch, first day after 7:00.
By that time, I needed a package for six hours, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't piss anyone off and send a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither of them has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already planned trips between world metropolises, especially aircraft to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of a year and the application was launched in March 2016.
They started to develop the application in December last year and released it this May.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The application was developed by Mesík and Mesík Profi since this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to do all these applications, which one day will merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has been a theme lately, and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Aren't you worried about working in an area that no one has been able to say much about yet, where is the border of sharing and where is the gray economy?
It's the same, except for a different product.
It's clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we'll be another thorn in the eye through the gray economy.
But even if someone saves money and earns money, it is not the intention to bypass the tax authorities and tax controls.
Every user, whether on the one hand or on the other, will be encouraged to tax his income if he makes it his income.
What makes you think the ministry has so much potential?
The sender saves and the ferryman earns or reduces the cost of the trip.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
In a time of social networking, which divides people, we would like to see this one converge.
There may be good stories, people are happy to help and talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
In my opinion, people have long been lacking a personal approach, and we say that this app is a service to people.
Then how do you guarantee that the courier doesn't escape with the package?
Each application user, together with the registration, scans the identity card and gives a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give credibility to the ministry and to man.
The couriers also collect stars based on the evaluation of the senders.
We offer insurance, we match the details.
The courier is responsible for the uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, but does not assume responsibility for content under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or ten kilos of hash in a sealed package in his trunk, the criminal liability will be charged to the sender.
Is there a threat of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, a traceable administrative body, which will be the only one able to see it, even we ourselves are not able to see it, the data are protected against abuse.
How much money does a courier get after a successful delivery of the shipment?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender shall be charged several percent extra to facilitate contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push on volume.
No one can charge the courier that he did not deliver the shipment when he actually delivered it, the receipt and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plato of eggs and big as a bass of beer.
After that, there's no more restrictions, and if anyone has room in the car, they can transport the fridge.
Plus, the sender has a chance to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier sees what's being asked.
You don't even have to pack if you don't want to hide the contents.
You put your forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to run the service?
A friend of mine had an idea more than two years ago, when I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me demo applications with supranational reach, which target mainly passengers by plane.
That's when I told him I wouldn't look for an investor, but I'd like to become one myself and put my savings into it.
Another year of development took us to establish Shippansee LTD in London because of the greater creditworthiness of the entire product.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on right now.
No, we focused marketing on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to get the app done, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to customer feedback and we are not dealing with the foreign market so much at the moment.
We know it's a long run, but we're in no hurry, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way upgrade.
I will transfer it when we said that the national segment can be much more interesting and that we will learn at least in the Czech Republic.
The third application Mesík is local, for the city.
But it can send a package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as much as I transfer, but the difference is that as a courier, you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your phone.
An app for couriers who want to do it for a living, we call it "Profi Messik."
So someone can make a lot of money by picking up packages all over town?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to earn his way to work.
Now that everyone's messing with the pokémon, they can pick this up exactly the same way.
One sees where there are orders around the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and transports the shipment.
It's set cheaper than competitive services.
At this point, we are still making a web interface that will be crucial for companies to send shipments, fill in data about them on the website, thus creating points on the map.
We are then able to invoice their use of the service every month.
Do you now pursue the project full-time?
It's hard for us, but we normally have it at work so that we can support and develop the project.
There is not a strong multinational investor behind us, we are two boys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped in with other suggestions and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage with us not the Czech market, but who should, with the forgiveness of the ball, go with us to a worldwide product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story section of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten diversity.
This will fix the second episode and the solo game in it will be more varied than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based on the concept of the network struggle in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility of using a combat titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels aimed precisely at the skillful movement.
They'll look like platformers and include puzzles.
For example, double jumps, wall running and rope slides are essential to overcome them.
In addition, it will sometimes be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will also be maps that resemble mazes and levels with special concepts.
For example, it will be possible to lift up platforms and close massive doors.
You will adjust the form of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should thus oscillate between ferocious action and calmer moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We're gonna play as Jack Cooper's pawn dreaming about his career as a pilot.
Cooper, at the start of the campaign, along with Captain Lastimos, will be shipwrecked on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And the wilderness won't be lenient to him either.
In addition, Lastimosa will suffer fatal wounds in the crash, and Cooper will therefore be tasked with making the captain's titan operational.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true sooner than expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot repair.
Cooper's calls to the titan will also be significant.
It will serve players as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time robot depersonal communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when titanium is dry, it lists all the injuries that Cooper is facing in the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 came from the Polygon server.
In addition, it will be possible to judge the result in two months and Bonusweb will bring you first impressions of the network game after Gamesco.
Titanfall 2 comes out on October 28th for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original label remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic changes name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the THQ label in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
Nordic has, for example, released Darksiders 2 Death Edition or the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, 23 other games are created for the label and 13 of them have not yet been discovered by the company.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a 20 - year - old man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - she was obviously trying for a long time, then they got together.
She's a big guy, probably her type, 'cause she dated a guy like that before me.
She's totally into him.
On those first days, her voice even changed, she had this girl's love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I've been watching the whole thing.
He would come home from work regularly at 3:30, so she would always go shopping at 3.
Every day, she tried to get her to see him.
Later, I found out they were meeting in his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got the keys, I was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, in the end I always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go there, make that decisive move.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife was controlling me mentally.
I think she soon found out that I was manageable, that I would do what she wanted me to do.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a pussy.
At the same time, my neighbors were telling me that they knew about it.
I was such a jerk, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all burst, it would be bad.
The only thing that ever happened to everyone in the family was the daughter.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But once I went to his apartment to see if I needed some help in the laundry room.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got an anonymous call, that he was seeing my wife, and that everything suggested it.
I asked him what he'd say.
He stood there, shriveled his shoulders, looked down and didn't say a word.
Then, too, at that time, I met his wife on my way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond, and she didn't tell me anything.
No one told me anything at the time.
I'm the kind of person who's never been around much, who's having trouble getting to know someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I wasn't even thinking about getting a divorce.
I was always counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all of this, and life would go on.
That's not what happened.
And I never really got over it all.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her a lot, but in the end, I stopped to calm down.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
She's just more my wife than my housekeeper.
At home she always did everything - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's a hard worker.
I always thought she was trying to keep me from having any other reason to complain.
And you could say she's nice.
But sometimes I want to pet her, hug her, and she won't let me.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage.
But she once told me that she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that she loves him to this day, it's her god.
And I don't like that kind of life.
Even then, when it started and I took it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live and I asked her what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to see if she'd agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it, and finally she said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After terrorist attacks, France is escalating the fight against radical Islamists, and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to make sure that only spiritual educated ones in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where the preachers often come up with jihad shots with money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It should have already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, internal contradictions struck her, and she never worked properly.
"It is a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is probably headed by former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a proponent of the secular state.
In France there are about 2500 mosques and mosques, some 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clergy from the country and are considering this step for several other tens.
This week, the German police also intervened against jihadist clergymen.
Imams allegedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated an area where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Right after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate about a new institution was on fire in France to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All has been speeded up by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
However, it is not yet clear where it will receive funding, even though several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, i.e. mainly for meat coming from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
This tax would be paid in practice by halal food vendors for granting permission.
Part of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who will go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them leave France for a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, only preachers who have been through educational programs at their universities should operate in French mosques.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government also shuts down radical mosques.
"Since December we have closed twenty of them and others will follow," said Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no room in France for those who proclaim hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was severely injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at a shopping mall in Zaragoza, North Spain, writes the Independent.
The shooting took place after a woman and daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car outside the shopping mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes the Independent.
An unharmed daughter took the woman to the hospital, an ambulance had to come for the men in critical condition.
The crime occurred around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous area of Aragon, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Asparagus wakame with algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes light, well digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our appetites and our heads.
And so the summer gardens smell like grilled neck, brisket, pork knee.
Nothing very healthy, nothing very light, sometimes with the exception of salad or baked vegetables.
True, barbecues are both time-saving and dish-saving, plus it's a social thing and no one has to be locked up in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to doing well with delicacies, which special dining, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or choke anything.
And they're going to make us feel better.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-adapted griffins are enough to make the preparation fun and food a real exotic delicacy.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, even more time consuming cooking and cooling of rice goes away.
The paper can only be softened into water for a moment and then it depends only on the chef's imagination, how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
It's not an eyelash like an eyelash.
The advantage of many Asian dishes today is that raw materials are usually already available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but genuine pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, which mixes several kinds of vinegar and ginger.
It is sufficient to buy a bag of appropriate size, and the appendix with proven antibacterial effects, which promotes digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used especially in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes within various festive occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed leaves of a banana tree are very widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America as a "tool" for preparing various baked, cooked and fried foods, which are wrapped in them in a similar way to the foil.
The banana leaf will then pass on a specific flavor to the food.
In our country, they can be bought in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
However, select only leaves rich green and thus healthy - uncracked and without stains.
Similarly, the preparation of salad from wakame, sesame, and sesame oil is easy.
Because you can buy it frozen again.
He who often eats or prepares sushi will probably know especially the nori eyelash.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - that is, the plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame − a dark green algae growing in the waters around Hokkaidó island − is also fresh and dried and is as popular as nori algae.
By the way, who wouldn't know miso soup with wakame, supposedly Asian women use it from the very beginning to recover after giving birth.
And at all, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
Cleans blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents hair from graying and is literally charged with minerals.
The dried and crushed wakame also serves as spices, such as rice flavoring.
Fresh algae are first let to leach in the water, then flushed, put into boiling water and cook for half a minute.
After that, it cools down in the ice water, cuts out the middle rib and further adjusts, for example as a favorite salad.
However, buying it already finished, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So all that remains is to wrap the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a bomb of longevity.
Unless you resist throwing in an extra grilled brisket.
Eat healthy, easy and summery.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a bit of skill, and you have an interesting fresh meal that deliciously combines tastes.
And it's done in no time.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white radish, 100 g green asparagus, 60 g cucumber, 60 g wakame algae and 60 g sweet chili sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of Sriracha chili sauce, 20 g mango and 40 g pickled gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
Let's get the rolls ready first.
We'll dip rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we remove it and wait for it to soften.
Meanwhile, in hot water, we cook asparagus shoots briefly, and then after about three minutes, we put them in ice water quickly so they don't lose color.
We put vegetable filling on the paper and pack it.
We prepare the filling with white radish, carrots and cucumbers, which we cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and paste on rice paper.
Place asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add rolls and finish the whole dish with wakame algae, pickled ginger, mango slice, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven rugby, Fiji's choice takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in the seven rugby ended with a devastating lead on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated the British in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio at 43:7.
The Fijians performed a master lesson in processing, landfill, evasiveness, support game, line-run and brutal forces - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unpretentious consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - the third for Britain on that day - and the British could have been proud of their performance in the seven rugby inaugural Olympic tournament, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard-earned win over the South Africans 7:5 in the semifinals that same day may have made them sick in the finals.
But Fiji, in its form, would defeat a 15-man team in full health.
Perhaps it will not be a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Ben Ryan, former head of England of Wimbledon, the Fijian coach.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
There was only one lost.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, British penetrations reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates it was like running behind a series of buses on the move and champions of the World Cup led 5:0 when Oseus Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
Timekeeper showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
Great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakaraw and stop him from scoring for the third time, but only the Fijians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added more after returning and there was still more than 1 minute left in the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouva then penetrated through the tedious British and rushed to the line where he scored.
After the conversion to 29-0 was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji was born for Rugby 7s while the British were still learning how to pass.
That's exactly how it is.
The British made mass changes after halftime, and the Fijian surge stopped for four full minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Fiji Josua Tuisov's brilliant interlude passed.
Dan Norton tried to win an opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown in the left corner to raise an 36:7. But long ago, the match was won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and their fans sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the completely joyous attitude of the Fijians.
At the end of the day, Mata Vilame sweetened another attempt to win the Fijians.
There was a whistle, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely down.
Even before that same day Fiji beat Japan 20:5 in the semifinals and Great Britain defeated South Africa in the close semifinals - by the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke the line of defense and scored under the hook in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother Anthony of England's 15th team, has won a great late landfill, and in the end, a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired to win the rowing race by coaching cancer
You won't find more emotional gold on these Games, and that's something to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing exhales into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
While there were two at the party, there were three voices in the boat. When the boat swung on the surface to meet the second Olympic gold behind it in the race of the women’s pairs, there was still a voice in the boat of the still present coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying down the water surface with the elegance of the swan - does not reflect the nature of victory entirely.
Behind each gold rowing medal is a battalion of auxiliary hands, which piece by piece means a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would live to see that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
In his words, it was uncertain.
I had a bladder cancer that could be operated on, and I had this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's gonna change your mind.
The cancer was detected by Williams in December 2013.
The lucky thing for the whole trio was that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, and thus reduce the blackout to a minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to pull myself together quickly.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this was a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory were their first thoughts of Williams, who was very nervous this morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to cope with his own restlessness.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who had completed a mission in Afghanistan, said: “This week I was at the bottom of my emotions, maybe it’s a little extreme, but it means so much.”
Again, it emphasizes how much this means to me, how much Helen and I worked together, and so did Robin.
Until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so he deserves a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better man for training, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The couple set off an amazing rhythm that their rivals couldn't match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were concentrating at the most at the moment.
Helen screamed, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't want to achieve something amazing.
We weren't looking forward to fireworks today, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
A couple takes a year to think about it before they decide what's next.
Glover's getting married next week, her future is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was gonna be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was the Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I have a much better feeling about this," she said.

Prison?
More like a free ride, says the Cabma Rubes hunter for a groundbreaking charge.
Six taxi drivers and former Magistrate official in Prague are, as CT said, defendants.
You've made a series of reports in which you've uncovered fraudulent practices and those that are supposed to be in a group that's going to be on trial.
You've been facing some unpleasant clashes with the exposed players.
How much is the report on the prosecution of the organized group to you?
I was expecting some kind of trial.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's no use.
Primarily, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by carrying all the people for free.
That's a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean, then, that you do not see a possible punishment effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so scared that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a pingle, another delivers pizza, and one completely bails on it.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a custody problem.
I consider this a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
People like that should bring back the companies that took her.
For a quarter of a century, they did what they did to destroy our country’s name and steal from its people.
So let them do a good business card now and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a community service.
Like someone goes to pick up trash, they get a car, and they take people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get parole eventually, and they're not gonna care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and subsequently at the Tomas Bata University in Zlín.
They belong to people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the website in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programmes, he is now preparing a programme Prague Guide, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
Rubeš advises them in the form of short reports, which services he prefers to avoid in Prague and which he recommends to use without fear.
Previously he filmed series with names How to do it, City of Scams?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
In the prosecution, they're referred to as an organized group.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mobsters?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from Godfather.
They're more like mobsters - juniors, but they're definitely organized.
Just watching each other's relays.
Prague is completely divided.
I traced that, for example, the main station does not like Parisian, Parisian does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlsbad (disco club)
Everyone's just watching their little spot, and each group is organized somehow.
It's probably an intricate network.
There are only seven people, six cab drivers, and one former Magistrate official who warned the driver about checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon did not disappear from the streets.
So what percentage among Prague’s taxi cheaters is your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still there.
For example, I'm talking about Aleš Ryaček.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he drives a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at the Charles Bridge and he drives people.
Last time I went with him, he asked me for $700 a mile.
For some reason, his police didn't detain him.
They only picked a few people from the whole big group.
The same situation is also in other locations of Prague.
Thus, the indictment of seven people is difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague vice, which apparently has much larger dimensions.
Of course, it's no use.
It'll help, but all evil can't be eradicated, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who steal from foreign tourists still perform in the same places you showed in the reports, that is, at the Charles Bridge or in Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day, and they break decrees every day.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague Magistrate.
It's not a cat's anymore, it's total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, though only a part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I thought of it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel like it needs to be a little bit better, I'm gonna keep doing it.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to get rid of him.
You can't settle for that.
But it's not like that, there are more of them, of course.
Are you still trying to confront them in the cabs?
Sometimes I do test drives, and I have to say, it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught this cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometres, although then he claimed that it was an amount of CZK 56 (used to trick with a decimal point).
He had a receipt for it, and the cops arrived, and this cab driver was so cutely rude, he was still going to see those cops, and he asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver taped the decimal point on the meter and robbed the tourists by CZK 357.
Can you say that the insolence of fraudulent taxi drivers did not give way even after you showed the faces of those who charged senseless sums for a short ride?
Their insolence is still incredible.
What happened to the cab driver reaching out to 56 kroner?
The cops sent him away, saying he couldn't be discussed with him on the spot because he put out a receipt.
And that's going to be a problem in that court too (six taxi drivers and one ex-officer).
There'll be a cab driver on one side with his receipts, on the other side of the police.
But according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the Magistrate must not use the secret recordings of the taxi service vehicle as evidence in a court of law.
When I was filming parts about their scams, the cabbies themselves warned me about this precedent.
I'm the only one who's ever wanted to use the footage for the story.
Are you afraid that this fact could protect them from trial?
I hope every judge understands that no cab driver could drive for six or ten kroner per kilometre, because he wouldn't make a living.
You were talking about a decimal trick that underwater taxi drivers move in front of foreign clients.
Is it still up to date, or are they concerned about using this trick after you release your reports?
I think we've popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
The other day, I was driving with a cab driver, bragging in front of me that he was the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed a black cardboard glued from the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what it had in there, he said to me, "You know what it is."
If the fines didn't work on the cab drivers, can the trial with their colleagues do so?
Is there anything that can stop them from cheating?
You said they'd always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can deter them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And they're fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
In my experience, I must say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague, fortunately, prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack an um.
They're not very good at it, and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (because of the proposal for a full-scale restriction coming from Mayor Adriana Krnáčová's office), it didn't sound very clear what they wanted.
Once they said they didn't protest against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and it only turned out to be the best ad possible for Uber.
How do you evaluate the approach of Prague City Hall in solving the problem of overcharging fares?
It's obvious that the criminal police had to step in to sort something out.
The Magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole who was leaking information, which means the taxi department had been doing its job for a few years completely for nothing.
I hope they charge this officer to the last check, all the controls he's had, so he'll realize what he's done.
That's the worst thing about it.
I even went on one of the checkpoints with him, which I found out later on from their schedule.
It's been months since the last series was published.
What's the response?
I'm thinking mainly from foreign viewers, which is what the series is most focused on.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play them those videos.
And then when we walk down Old Town Square, they're surprised that the same people who are seen in the footage are standing there.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd put a blanket around them so people would look at them.
The Communism Museum right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab when you need to?
Right.
I ride with services that I don't have to pay in cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there's no chance of fraud.
But there are also a lot of conveniences that are fair.
I only took a cab on the street once since then.
The driver said to me after getting in the car, "Wow, you've got some balls."
I'm dressed as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were mentioned in 2005.
In the same year, former Mayor Pavel Bém set off for a control drive in disguise as an Italian tourist and immediately at the first attempt the driver cheated him by 200.
But editor Rubeš had worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him CZK 820 for driving from Old Town Square to Wenceslas Square, which is worth about CZK 195 per kilometer, as reported by the reporters.
The Prague City Hall has set the maximum price at CZK 28 per kilometer.
There are also other surprising sums in the film: for example, a two-mile journey from Parisská street to Truhlářská cost the tourist CZK 400.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge.
They also charge 600 crowns for the ride to Angel, which has a 2.5 km.
Marble washes mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer the better.
Impurities go well out of it, although sometimes dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be pulled out of the folds.
It's not easy, and it's not fast, but the restorer Vanessa Trostová from Oldřichov, Hájy, approached her work.
Hat down in front of it: the headstone is built with scaffolding, on which it is necessary to climb countless times and climb again.
"The restorer should be careful, patient and undemanding to the working environment," she said.
In Frýdlant it is far from her first restoration work.
Thanks to it the stone elements of the facade in the rear wing of Frýdlant Town Hall were restored, also statues of St. Mary Magdalena in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Piet in Frýdlant Okružní street, Marian column in Frýdlant and atlanta in the façade of the spa in Nový Město pod Smrkem.
The restoration of Melchior, Kryštof and Kateřina from Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleansed from the deposits of impurities and crust, released stone parts are secured against fall and shift; either they will anchor into the wall or to each other.
They also expect treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gold again.
"Then the gilding of the inscriptions on the marble plates will begin with pure slicing gold," said Věra Sobotová, State Monumental Care Officer at the City Office in Frýdlant.
There's no history of a tombstone being repaired.
At a closer glance, the openings, drilled in marble columns, will take hold.
They're hundreds of years old, and they're remains of the tombstone decoration.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately after the Swedish raid during the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
They literally brushed the tombstone, remarked Saturday.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross there are restorers with a slight exaggeration as at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to fix the tombstones that found themselves underwater, to restore the baptist, wall paintings in the tomb, and now the tombstone.
"We would also like to set out in the future," she told Saturday.
The church is in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Redernov tombstone will cost a total of CZK 128 000.
They will be paid out of subsidies, the city will not deposit any of its money into this part of the recovery.
A hundred thousand crowns will go from winning in the circuit round of the Historical City of 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, specified by the Mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The council decided to release the winnings to restore the tombstone.
Opinions of experts on future developments on selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one month and a half a year.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who'd have thought that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which went through 12% correction in February, is now at a new historical peak and has already credited 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
Once again, the iron rule is confirmed that traders should never go against the interest of central banks, which in the end have always achieved their goals.
In a situation where US stocks are at a historical high, the volatility that is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown contently and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative easing of the US central bank, and when, like today, the VIX has remained stable below the 12 percent threshold.
And I don't want you to.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England, which will buy 70 billion pounds of bonds in the coming six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing pushes the already low yields even lower and contributes to an almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That, of course, is a million-dollar question.
But at the moment there are no risks, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and China is stabilizing and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if US stocks continue to survive in a similar quiet regime.
Too bad Juncker's not studying Klaus!
I am very glad that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, Juncker said, when the French politician (really experienced, because he had so many different supranational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to look for) appointed the European Commission’s chief negotiator on the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU.
Juncker's selection has blown away signs of hope that it is in the serious interest of the EU to seek future forms of friendly coexistence with Britain.
But most British media have accepted the name Barnier as Juncker's act of war.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
He hates Great Britain.
As a Euro Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He took it as only he could have taken it: the hardened enemy of Anglo-Saxon concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
The supporter of multilateral regulations was co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union, and he resented everything that comes from the London City Financial Center, and he pushed through legislation of excessively harsh financial sector regulations and services.
So this Michel Barnier, a representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a tough, tough, and probably ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How not to remember in this context the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance sheet, overview and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
That is why today Czechs and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies.
Too bad Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this.
It would be good for everyone!
An earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin's ruler released his loved one, Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov as president of the presidency on Friday.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
She informed the Russian media about this, referring to the Kremlin's press service announcement.
Putin indicated that Ivanov was being released at his own request.
At a meeting that was broadcast by Rossija 24, the president said he was willing to meet Ivanov's wishes when he took up office that he wanted to be president of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the President's administration, now led by Ivanov's current Vajno representative, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63 years old, is described as one of Putin’s closest collaborators.
In the past, for example, this former KGB officer held the post of Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now leave the seat of a member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov said, however, at his meeting with Putin, that the length of remaining at the head of the administration is actually a recordman.
It lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have been replaced in this capacity.
Even Uncle and Shafaro's debuts won't play the finals.
So far, neither of Friday's tennis matches has been able to turn into a final turnout.
Petra Kvitová lost her first fight, who succumbed to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after the sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
The Czech deblist Šafářiová and Uncleová followed the kvitová after a while.
While Williams sisters’ slayers were reaching out for the win in the first set, they wasted two sets of sets, and the Russians eventually captured the set in the short game.
The second set then lost the ratio of 4:6.
Half the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skifar Ondřej Synek with an overview won his semifinals, when he beat the second Damir Martin from Croatia by almost a second in the end.
Good today, conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, said Son.
It was his rivals, unlike him, who had to fight for progress.
So they've lost some strength, which could make it easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing into my hands, said the oar of Prague Dukly.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková didn't walk in Dreamy's footsteps.
Thirty-five-year-old rower took the fourth position in today's semi-final in her ride, and on Saturday she will start in B finals and fight for 7th to 12th place.
The gold from London won't defend like that.
I didn't make it to the finals at the Olympics for the first time.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I ran a good race, and I put everything I could into it.
The contestants were just better, Topink Knapková bowed before them.
She fought to the end and believed that she would make it to her fourth games among the elite six.
She gave up the fight just before the finish line.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could make it out of that field.
I was surprised the Chinese woman had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it to the finals through Austrian.
Unfortunately, there was a life race today, said the 2011 World Champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who failed to get out of the qualification for the second time, this time the small marks in the lie.
In it, he didn't get the 33rd place.
Qualification was best served by the Russians.
From the first place passed Sergei Kamensky with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628,9).
Nephew's spread was worth 620.5 points.
The program in Rio was first spoken by athletes, including Czech seven-bottles Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachová belongs eleventh place after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech record player Eliška Klučinová is 22nd.
Leads British Katarina Johnson-Thomson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters as well as a second Belgian woman named Nafissata Thiam.
Both took care of historically the best altitude performance within the seven-gauge.
They were still trying to jump 201 centimeters, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Apart from the absurdity of the questions asked: German society has undergone profound self-reflection, whereas Russian society has not.
In the 20th century, dictators appeared in both major Eurosian nations, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, Russian Bolsheviks contributed to a great deal to the 94 million victims of communism mentioned in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent war leadership or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanely wiped out about 6 million Jews, and the total sacrifice of World War II is estimated at 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, the atrocities were carried out by the Germans and the Soviets.
In Germany and the USSR, not only a few individuals were to blame, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passively or just cowardly, or by sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not just the specificities of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask, Father, Grandfather, why did you participate in such atrocities?
How could you do that!
This brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, German elites were mainly concerned about the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't want to reconnect Alsace-Lotrinsko or someone - to attack the revansh - militarily - everyone will recognize that.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often a criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
Russia's putinian politics is revanš, conquering lost territories, humiliating the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of our own people are no value to the vermin.
Fight your battles, and strangers will fear.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from the growth of tensions around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In the last days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimean region has deteriorated.
Who is benefiting from the growth of tension?
After a longer period of relative calm, Ukraine's relations with Russia have again deteriorated further.
The pretext of the Ukrainian party became the peninsula of Crimea, which was connected more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both opposing sides contradict each other and are difficult to verify independently, so we can only think about the old familiar question for whom it benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian party, which Ukraine naturally rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
A well-known response to the arrest of Ukrainian special forces in Russia has already been received from the case of pilot Savchenko that they were reportedly abducted in Russia.
If we agreed to the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further acquittal of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, there has been a retreat from the situation in Ukraine against the background of the immigration crisis in Europe.
Ukraine’s leadership has already lost complete credit in front of its inhabitants, with current support for President Poroshenko around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would have been bankrupt long ago if it had not been for generous financial injections by the EU and especially by the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention to its country again vigorously in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces again want to show up as strong men who are not afraid to face the great Russia.
All we can hope for is that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but of all ordinary people on both sides and stop their enemy actions in time.
Bulgaria showed inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the travels of these consumer goods groups in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
The U.S. Secret Service said they've been tracking hacker attacks from the Russians for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came out last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the party headquarters servers of the Democrats.
But no official report mentions Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied the part of the attack.
The report of the alleged Russian attack was top secret, because its disclosure would reveal that US secret services are monitoring the hack attack and could be exposed as well as the way they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence agencies reportedly participated in the attack.
New Cyber Security Advisory Board
The material on tracking the Russian trail was encrypted, and only a small group of experts had access to it, wrote Reuters.
Only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, known as the US gang of eight, were informed of public officials.
It is made by the heads of both chambers of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, chairmen of the Democrats in both chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of the Congressional Defence and Security Committees.
On Thursday, the acting head of the Democratic Party Donna Brazile announced that she was setting up an advisory board for cyber security to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of Democratic Party servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of consumer's initiative on health problems after food consumption Salmon smoked - pieces 100 g, consumption date 22.11.2016 Prague hygienist carried out a check in shops Albert on Wenceslas Square and Na Mostku.
The verification found that the lot L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer pointed out was no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was removed.
The laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and man-made live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Sticha.
We apologize to our customers for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the lot from sale and for preventive reasons we withdrew all other lots of this item.
Mistakes took place on the part of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, told the New Speakers of Albert Barbora Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it in any of the chain stores and get the money back.
The larvae destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrátata.
Hygienists informed the Prague and Central Czech veterinary administration of the occurrence of dangerous product.
According to the food safety.cz server, people after ingestion of the parasite can become ill by anisakiosis, which manifests itself with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can occur without symptoms, according to the Czech News Agency.
Symptoms occur an hour to two weeks after consumption of insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks after the onset of larvae disease, they usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Grown worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, therefore they are killed either in sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or in freezing.
The vets have currently checked the salmon with the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had a parasite in them.
The shipment with 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Expedited, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, was to date 919 packages.
At present, the unsold stock is being withdrawn from the stores, said spokesperson Petr Pejchal on Friday ČTK.
Immediately after the positive samples were found, the vets prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman tried to flee Rakka, probably killed by a Russian air raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and quick marriage with a jihadist who was soon killed, sobering came.
For British girls, the expected paradise of the Caliphate turned into hell on earth from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She made repeated phone calls to Britain and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They've been ordered to shoot without a thought, quoting The Telegraph as the lawyer of the deceased girl's family, Tasnim Akunjee.
The last trace led to Rakka, the last word from there was from the girl.
Then there was only a report of her death, which could not be verified.
Her family was communicating with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they were hoping to meet their former student again.
However, Kadiza was likely killed before she could escape, since the house in which she stayed compared to the ground of the air raid in May, reports British ITV News.
TV added that the bomb apparently dropped a Russian plane that attacked the IS bastion in Syria.
You'd put up with blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family lawyer.
In the week when she (Kadiza) was thinking about fleeing Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape, and according to the information available, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think she took it as a warning and decided not to take risks, according to the BBC Akunjee.
Family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old friends from Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set out on the road on February 17th last year.
All they said at home was they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there via Turkey to IS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl's family was doing everything in their power to get Kadiz back.
You'd take the blues out of the sky just to get your child out of the danger zone, and this family did everything they could, strained their strength to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught alone, the lawyer added.
The only positive thing he thinks is that Kadiza's fate can serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went there, realized how things were going there, understood how far it differed from the promises of the Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also paused, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries the village of Inveraray was a regional center and the seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts have been held at the town hall and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts resided were pitiful and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them have been successful.
That's why the city officials decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more friendly to the prisoners, it had heating and gas lighting.
Either way, it has not been in operation for a long time; it was closed for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, since smaller corrective facilities were expensive for operation and did not pay much.
The stories of convicts and ghost hunts.
The prison was opened to the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new building to see for themselves how different conditions existed in them.
Guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment have been applied to criminals, whether it is to break fingers or burn marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked up in one of the cells, mostly for a photograph in memory, or to create a feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, the Inveraray prison is one of the most famous Scottish locations where it is reported to be haunted.
Several groups of paranormal activity hunters have gone out there, and to this day the museum allows people to come hunting ghosts.
But such a night will cost 300 pounds, which is roughly 9500 crowns.
Besides this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animus, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Snapchat every day allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with the identity of ways bordering on absurdity.
You can make yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that seems to come out of Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies each day.
Any mistake will be made public immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past earned criticism of the accusation that the application promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin shades as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered the users a filter this week that gave them sloping eyes, twisted teeth and puffy faces, some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated issues did not point to the greater problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it and the news and indignation spread quickly and Snapchat stated the next day that he cancelled the function.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended to show accounts to the characters of animé, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But the filter reminded observers who witnessed racism of painful stereotypes in action.
The others flatly rejected the comparison with the cartoons.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, said in her e-mail that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it is hard to argue against the comparison of obvious Asian caricature and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not just about the yellow face, but that the yellow face is drawn to a disdainful extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural limits.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from meeting halls in corporations to Holywood and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
"When a Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to a user," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu on Thursday in an interview, "it's very difficult to get past these things today, as it used to be."
Katie Zhu, the product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and invited others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in an interview over the phone, she said that she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflected a lack of diversity in the recruitment of Snapchat workers.
Katie Zhu criticized the vast white, completely male leadership of society and finished the article hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they have no diversity and color people among employees at the moment when these things are decided," said Zhuová, who has a Chinese-American origin, "or color people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak."
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees, with the status of a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter who should focus on an under-represented population and internal inclusion management.
Zhuová adds: "I wonder if they really need other such users who can say that it's not right," with their account being cancelled.
Army officers misrepresented information about IS, says the parliamentary committee
In a report issued on Thursday, the Parliamentary Committee stated that officers from the Central Headquarters of the United States changed intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events of the country did.
According to the preliminary report of the Task Force prepared by the Republican Chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defence, a "extensive dissatisfaction" was found among the analysts of the Central Intelligence Service, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of their efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military central in Tampa, Florida, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release on the report states: “The outputs of intelligence intelligence services approved by Centcom’s superior officers usually offered a more positive image of US counterterrorism efforts than confirmed by the facts on earth, and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.”
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when a false analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Ken Calvert, congressman and Republican from California.
The failure in the management of Centcom goes to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing US efforts in training the Iranian forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decisive evidence that the Obama administration’s leaders ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that analysts felt that Centcom’s leaders were under pressure to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases from the Central Staff, statements and statements from the Congress were significantly more positive than the events actually were," the report states.
For example, Centcom’s representative publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, remains under Islamic control.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said MP Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican Party in Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence staff of the US Central Staff handled the outputs of the intelligence services of the staff in order to bagate the dangers of IS in Iraq.
Republicans formed a working group after learning about analysts’ concerns that intelligence information relating to the Islamic State is being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday must be followed by a more detailed examination.
Centcom's intelligence is still under investigation by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Committee on Intelligence published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the Republican Working Group’s conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015 Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling the evaluation of information about IS and the Iranian security forces," said representative Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the Committee and representative of Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “led to distort the output of intelligence services,” he damaged morale among analysts and “inadequately took dissent into account.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House is trying to push Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions according to the "model or political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported an ongoing investigation into the Pentagon Inspector General, which was initiated after Centcom’s analysts’ complaints.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, Pentagon spokesman, stated in his statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the parliamentary report because the Inspector General's investigation is still ongoing.
However, he stated that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental questions of national security.”
The investigation has consequences beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement now declaring a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year's accusations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of intelligence about the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than ten years, when the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper saying that President George W. Bush's administration, despite the objections of many analysts, defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements of the opposite, air strikes against Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group, because the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings but were not transmitted outside the central staff.
Centcom's commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized for the past year after many legislators found the Senate's testimony too positive by assessing the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by Gen Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. won field hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will be a decisive match in the UK team
Katie Bam scored three goals in a match against Japan, which ended with a 6:1, and just a day later she scored the first two goals of the game for the American women’s field hockey team, in which America beat India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two matches is a success worth remembering, but Bamová (27) said that she was not sure if she had ever succeeded in this.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those who writes down their goals.
But he knows this: Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to 4-0 games and share the first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained undefeated on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarterfinals and the game will decide who will end up in the first and second place of the group of six teams.
The team from the first place avoids the strong Danes who are at the head of the second group a little longer.
No matter how Saturday's game ends, the Americans here caused a stir with their surprise ride, four years after they ended up among the 12 teams at the London games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took a hockey hockey stick for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older sisters twins played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the final roster.
Then came 2012 when neither she nor the members of her team were doing very well.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bamová said.
In London, we did not have the pace of work we have today.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night Bam started in the first half by shooting the goal bekendem from nearby.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly hard and kept score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then clicked into the center and shot the ball into the goal to get the americans in the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American goalie, Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three wins, was the first at the tournament ever.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of Saturday's match.
Zen trampolines in the middle of the Olympic rampage
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro make it feel persistent, indescribable, and biased by the rotation of competition and effort.
It's like an Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay stake passed from a gunner to a swimmer, a gymnast, and a triathlon player.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the grudge between Michael Phelps and Chad le Closes.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with dimples in their faces, is in the Olympics for the first time, and could also be among those whose names will be heard in households in prime time between advertising and sponsor spots if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
Olympic fire doesn't shine on all competitions the same way.
Away from the center, a bit in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting of air guns, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We'll always have success in the classic swimming style, and he'll probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my special favorite, let me point out the inconspicuous spell of the trampoline.
Although jumps on the trampoline have been Olympic sports since 2000, when they were first introduced to Sydney games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport has remained almost unnoticed - many of the people I asked about, did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The US never won a medal in trampoline jumps, and none of the athletes made it to the finals until 2012.
Prices in the male category are usually shared between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be embraced by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The jumps on the trampoline have yet another bad luck, partly because the ear of the uninitiated will seem more suitable for the clown university than for the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a country-watching enthusiast.
It has a comic potential - comical vibrations of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine within itself.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish word "el trampoline" meaning "jumper board."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline, which shoots them to a height of almost 10 meters and perform assemblies with several elements (salts, screws and combinations) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to implementation, difficulty and “times in the air”.
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic course is forward.
Warriors for gold medals must go on, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
He tries not only to catch up with the finish tape or the starting wall, but, as TV news reports, he also tries to catch up with another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also rather exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on a trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The athlete's track on the trampoline is up.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she is reflected, as if they were in a weightless state as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, difficulty, it is not possible, but during the duration of the lineup there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no measuring distance, but only perfect, smooth time and gravity.
This is the closest thing the Olympics and Zen will ever get.
Qualification and final of women takes place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock Eastern time, male competitions then on Saturday at the same time.
NBC Station will broadcast the finals within the afternoon block, which starts both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of Olympic madness, they promise a quiet, pleasant moment that you will probably overlook through the other battles.
And if attention is to be reached only by male athletes being the subject of love views and materialization - as Wall Street Journal magazine recently suggested by US gymnasts - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch their breath.
"Protesting Generations" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have come across violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot during the clashes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the past few months, however, anti-government unrest has engulfed the country, spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was merciless.
Witnesses claim that policemen have been shot and killed by armies of unarmed demonstrators.
On the upcoming video recordings of protests, probably from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, members of the security forces are captured beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even harder to move forward," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the danger of terrorist attacks in the region, particularly Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has significantly improved - even a new suburban train runs in the capital of Addis Abeba.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without ceasing talks about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were banished, imprisoned, killed, or banished far into the desert.
But that may change.
"If you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breach," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the youth.
He's been protesting for generations.
There are many complaints, and they concern everything from soil disputes to absolute control over the power of the ruling coalition.
After the elections last year, which were widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in Parliament.
At the same time, pressure is increasing on the border with Eritrea. A conflict along this inaccurately marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitians fear that separatist groups that have been suppressed more or less in recent years, such as the Oroma Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to take advantage of the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, now after years of smoldering beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have rekindled.
The first one is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks for up to the last few years, when they have become commonly available cheaper smartphones and the provision of Internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is common during protests, many people can still communicate via online proxy that hides the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered for protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between the Oroma and the Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oroma and Amhar are not natural allies.
For ages, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian hills of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade and exploited Oromas, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on our way to a united leadership," said Mulat Gemech, leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests occurred in areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigrai ethnic group, which account for around 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of the riot is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former leader of the rebels, was Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an undisclosed disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly masterful at exposing initial signals of discontent and using envoys to process opponents and win them on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who originated in the Tigra region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts called elections that the government failed and then stole.
There was a hard hit, during which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts appreciated Ethiopia’s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there's dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month protesters in the town of Gondar, Amhar, attacked business firms owned by Tigreans, and hatred against the Tigreans on social networks became increasingly common.
Analysts say that protests put the US and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over neighboring Somalia, although it recently declared that the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile area.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to bagate the latest controversy on Friday, flooding his campaign, stating that he didn't mean it when several times this week he insisted that Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an uncomfortable situation, who have fought hard to defend him in stormy times and must explain that he may not have been serious about his remarks.
After this proposal at the meeting on Wednesday night Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in the talks that he really did not intend to say that the President and H. Clinton created IS.
But in his Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The paper was the opposite of saying an old one day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to ease Trump’s comment by reminding Obama that he was trying to destroy IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at the moment when Trump attempted to focus his campaign's attention on the economy, while his preferences in election polls are falling.
Trump and Clinton took part in a duel in Michigan this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on the subject.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton’s proposals were linked to tax increases, and he said that someone thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defenses before.
At the end of July, when he reaped a wave of criticism, when he proposed that the Russians should penetrate Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comment by saying, "Of course, I am sarcastic."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and to temper them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing to what extent some reports have a response from his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction he then “explained”, said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
However, I also think that he is skillful in his statements and knows that he is vague enough to explain them differently.
As the results of the election polls continue to decline in his favor, Trump has in recent days chosen an even more snappy tone, instead of tempering things for the general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Tump was far away from Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very close to Florida.
Trump is even trying to avoid apologizing for provocative statements he says, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But, along with Trump’s increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes put his loyal followers in an awkward position, who must publicly stand behind him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively on Thursday in an interview for CNN.
"I believe that what he says is a legitimate political comment," Giuliani said when asked about Trump's assurance that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama the IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he mistakenly called a rookie, and it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans try to argue that the Obama government, in which Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed IS to grow and not be able to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday’s meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to rain fire on the media on Twitter for reflecting and biasing his every word.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” TV scholars who tried to understand him and said, “They can’t do that! ”
Several democrats sneered at Trump's apology, saying it was just more proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the market by prices. Now it returns in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe Café was a shabby place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, it was pushed from the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the store Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea hotel ransacked, and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, then it's also rediscovering.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original site.
New Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Also coffee is still good.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original café, who is also the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the transfer to a new location, he said he'd be happy to do it.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things the way they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same espresso machine model.
He even used the lighting from the old Verba again.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new, too.
He started using new ingredients.
There are ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings, such as capers and fried onions.
You will also find bowls of brown rice.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original regulars.
"A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices," he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe often.
It even happened when the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verbo," she said.
Now again drinking coffee, but on that day instead of her usual iced coffee she had mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been devoted to Verb since 2003.
They go before work and order the same thing.
"At quarter and eight, I come here every day, like clockwork, and they're already preparing my bagel with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he gets bacon, eggs and ham on his bagel with everything.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry the soap business took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an additive.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also received the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it up soon so his new neighbors would feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juice manufacturer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
It is possible for the café to extend to the neighboring building.
Many customers are satisfied to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says when the coffee shop reopens, coming in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressed food from the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the presidency in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
Swan President Roosevelt enjoyed selected dishes from the 5th Avenue, such as goose pâté and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for this day was more modest: eggs on the devil's way in tomato sauce, potato puree and plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to the Americans to eat. ”
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights is devoted to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's latest book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the story of a living house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work, “A Square Meal”, published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed their own cooking solidarity and met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small steep buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which according to the couple was excellent for talking about food during the crisis.
“The meatballs were very popular”, said Ms. Ziegelman.
Selling peanut, liver and bean meatballs.
They were made from the ingredient and other cheap foods that set the ingredient.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe smirked.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a buffet, what you eat.
Teams of women were cooking for farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. And Square Meal watched the ways in which the nation was coping with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said in explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally feared: Mysterious foods, such as meatballs and castrette dishes, were spread as “a wonderful way to take advantage of leftovers,” remarked Ziegelman, because cooks could hide unesthetic ingredients under the layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the central point of American food - has become a cost-effectively allocated luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were to serve as caloric and nutritional fillings, had priority over flavor or even common sense in cooking.
During book research, which contains recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period meal of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the evening table," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized: “It was surreal. ”
Peanut butter and roasted onions don't go together.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never thereafter, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the sheriff of the Federal Bureau of Domestic Economy between 1923 and 1943 - controlled the eating habits of the country.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take the reins of the budget, and slops, such as cream spaghetti and carrots, turned into tasty foods.
The book A Square Meal is a celebration of historical delicacies.
First of all, desserts were created in the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's pose for "I'll have a pie."
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farming cuisine of his childhood, he was dining as the selected millionaire he had become.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He ate in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him set an example with his own stomach.
As the book relates, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all, which led to the White House being “not only served the most posh food in all of Washington, but also in the most unsatisfying way prepared.”
Many of the eating habits of the crisis have subsided as soon as the country is back on its feet.
The legacy remained in our constant investigation of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
A couple say that while writing a book, they understood Ms. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits better - like why she couldn't throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman remarked: “People were sick of it. ”
There's been an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg's tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert that they prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly put a spoon in thick brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then one more time.
And as a proper householder, he said to his wife: “A bit of meatloaf would be good. ”
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most refugees who are rolling into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
That's what TV shows would look like if we made them.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us make fun of their native country.
Photoshop creates collages that humorously show what it would look like if famous series and films were shot in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of expenses for legal representation in the case of a patent against hepatitis C against Merck
The district court judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of legal fees incurred in the proceedings for a patent against hepatitis C against a manufacturer of medicines by Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment that Gilead was to pay 200 million for the damage caused by the breach of two Merck patents in connection with the very successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge had found out repeatedly against the law on the part of Merck, among other things, a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
On Thursday, Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that Gilead was entitled to the waiver of fees incurred in connection with the case’s representation.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the next generation market for hepatitis C drugs, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active component of Gilead drugs.
American-supported military forces claim to have gained full control of Manbij City
US-backed military forces gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, said the group spokesperson on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city after the rest of the radical group that have been hiding in the city has left.
The troops liberated over 2,000 civilians who were detained by the radicals, told Reuters Sharfan Darwish from the SDF alliance and the military council of Manbij.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it", he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return on Friday, stating that the presidential candidate for democrats and her husband had $10.75 million in income in that year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton was given $1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation. President Bill Clinton contributed almost $5.3 million worth of tuition to the joint register, and the former Secretary of State admitted $3 million of income from Simon & Schuster for his book on his work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's co-candidacy, U.S. Senator Tim Caine from Virginia State, along with his wife Anne Holton, has published tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine remain a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
Against that Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and receding from his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary that candidates for the President of the United States publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose it on them.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers quoted the US Treasury Tax Department audit as a reason for his refusal to publish tax returns.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's Twitter aide, following up on the democratic candidate's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, special adviser to Trump, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax returns until the audits were complete.
According to Trump’s critics, among whom is the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, they agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profit, charity contributions, business transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has a strong voice on the question, and on Friday she released a video that reminds us of how high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to publish her tax returns.
On Thursday, they will mention the question in their speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said in front of people.
Politico said that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim that this can be the case now.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton advocates a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that everyone who makes more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet called Trump to meet and exchange tax returns at a Clinton convention in Omaha, Nebraska State, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway resides.
Buffett said that he also passed an audit of the IRS and that Trump was not "fearing" of the tax office, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign released tax returns back to 2007.
Clinton, who now live in Chappy, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, wages in their incomes amount to just $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton was given income on dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Naturalists in Tanzania use unorthodox methods to prevent elephants from going to human dwellings - throwing condoms filled with chili powder.
This process proved to be successful, and Honeyguide, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservation, promotes this process and train volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to protect their homes and crops in four steps without harming animals.
Many of them used to use spears to defend themselves.
Friday is the world elephant day dedicated to protecting these animals.
“Since they developed this... set of tools, we have noticed a change in behavior in these communities. People believe that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said Honeyguide Damian Bell’s CEO in a statement.
The first and second steps are to light the flashlight on the passing elephant and start the horn.
If it doesn't deter him, he'll be throwing away the so-called "chilli cloud".
Chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped together with a firecracker in a condom, its end is wrapped so that only a wick can see from it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a fine chili powder is scattered into the air.
Usually one whiff and the elephant goes in another direction.
The last option is to detonate the fireworks, which triggers a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned on the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling Israel on the "application" of Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a commotion in the media after he found out that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have the code for calling Israel, according to the employee's words on the basis of the "demand" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of a documentary film on the Shoah Holocaust, vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of codes for calling at the hotel.
However, the state has not been introduced between countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that Israel was removed and deleted in Berlin, the capital city of Germany, in 2016?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmann said, "shocked."
The hotel worker replied that the measure was “decided upon consideration of the management of Kempinski Hotels.”
The reason for this move made the director even more angry.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's call code be deleted," Lanzmann quoted the staff in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame".
We were appalled and shocked by the events.
It's a huge shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There's no need for further explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event triggered a strong online reaction, people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel is simply "lost" in the demands of Arab customers.
"The shame on you," says another post, which points out that the hotel, located in the noble street of Kurfurstendamm, is located near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel daily, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any accusations by calling the event "overlooking" and "apologizing" to Lanzman.
"No direct order has ever been issued" not to include Israel in the call code list, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung as the representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against Brazilian students protesting
The clash of students and police took place in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, when the students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problem escalated when government order services tried to disperse students, which ended with the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among San Paulo Governor Gerald Alckmin’s proposals to save money is the closure of nearly hundreds of public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration could be seen spraying signs against temporary President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the protestors massed on the streets to support the deposed President Dilma Rousseff, when the Senate in the country decided to prosecute her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan increased his sales turnover by 70.9 percent year-on-year comparison after the abolition of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were abolished, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies renew existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, Russia’s and Iran’s trade turnover increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same 2015 period, reaching $856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent, reaching $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jump increase in trade was ensured by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued around 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly travel.
Moreover, Iran first reached the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It can be safely said that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be overcome," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visited by a relatively small number of Russians, and the ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where they are in good condition preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization," he said.
Scot Callum Skinner rushes home after the British have won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the hall of fame last night in a male team sprint on a velodrome in Rio when the VB trio defended the title from London 2012.
A 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man pleased the legend when he rushed to the finish line and stole the victory from the favored New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise win four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after the end of the modest sixth at the World Championship in Runway Cycling in March, even though Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for a specialized introductory racer named Jamie Staff.
So Hindes appeared just in time.
After Hoy's departure, there was also a vacancy that he tried to fill in Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches, and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was together with Hoy champion four years ago - and with Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but the leotard took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after his bike, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, when Hindes went on a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his BBC commentator position, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes got on stage, he didn't take his eyes off them.
Twenty - three - year - old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison. ”
I'm here to get the best of myself and to honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There's no better way to win this.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
Later, he withdrew the note and Britain’s opponents had no opportunity to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said: “With all the British flags on the bleachers, I felt like I was in London. ”
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we will have five successful days on the velodrome.
With the form that Kenny did, it's not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
That would then for Kenny - who is exactly on a day 12 years younger than Hoy, also has the birthday of 23 March (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, on this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
As much as Hoy got.
Next up, Kenny will be participating in a sprint that starts today and lasts another three days.
A 21 - year - old native from Bolton said: “Now I enjoy this one.
Team racing is always the best.
You're winning along with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood title. ”
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in a four-kilometer fighter race.
They ended up with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (22:42) take place on today's second day of the race, on which Wiggins will definitely focus.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when he was called on by the referees to measure height.
In a similar race of women that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie have reached a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on their strong team of race cycling and dominated the middle season of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After a truly exceptional performance, showing absolute dominance in Beijing and London, it declined in preparation for Rio's expectations.
There were dramatic events in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and discrimination, and the termination of the career of great men such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the Velodrome races, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of the plant in Portland after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminium melting plant in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of a power plant that supplies electricity and which informed about the intention of one of the owners of the melting plant to terminate the electricity supply agreement. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be cut short.
This is after the government of Victoria decided earlier this year that it would not extend the granting of subsidies that keep the business going.
The fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk in Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be threatened when closed.
And since the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be other avalanches.
Alcoa closed Point Henry in 2014, which led to the closing of Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting plant in Portland is down, and it's in danger of closing.
This is followed by several years of speculation about the company’s future, initially in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to plant production prices.
The AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, stated that it expected that one of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Aluminium, small business shares are held by Chinese company CITIC and Japanese company Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called ‘insurance contracts’, which should have entered into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for the fiscal year 2017’, declared the power plant.
In addition, any possible impact on the profits of AGL since the fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to the strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL stated that it had already drawn up the value of the contracts according to its books of $187 million “in case of termination.”
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract ‘has no impact on its ... ability to operate a melting plant or to secure the supply of electricity to a melting plant.'
The American company stated that in 2010 it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have started to apply from November this year, although it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very careful about the possible closure of the portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
The head of operations of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts a year.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial decrease in demand on the market [electric power].
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian real estate TV show - now he is the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan's mother-manager, appeared on the front page of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the ambassador of Estee Lauder, who performed at a fashion week in Milan, Paris, and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this cover," Kendall wrote.
The cover-up was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of Kardashian humorism?) staged video in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (Robo and Caitly bar punks and all their favorite uncle from show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) was staged. They forgot about their sister's cover so that the scene could end in a classic turn: they're throwing a secret party.
It's an interluded storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of the children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on the show at 8:00 a.m.), but somehow Kris needed to make sure that the other girls could make a living in this publicity.
Because if we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we've certainly entered the new Kardashian era.
The older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the year.
The publication, which by its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist calculated that of 832 pages in last year's edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
Uncovering the star that appears on the front page is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that in the past two years, the pictures of the magazine have escaped prior to its official publication.
Among the women who have appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista, or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "celebritys that make models" on the front page than "models that are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar-winning ambassador of Dior, appeared on the front page in 2013, a year later, Laga Gaga had the honor.
But while it is highly unlikely that Kendall - described by the magazine as a "breakthrough model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not related to well-known people, not to the stars of real estate shows, or to kids today who know how to make a well-cut video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career due to the release of Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult due to her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "whores of the moment".
These feelings flared up again with news of Jenner appearing on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction isn't right.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the real sense.
He's performing for Mark Jacobs.
He sells you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare moments, he performs on a reality show, maybe just as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community legal aid centres reject 160 000 people a year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable citizens are denied legal aid in community centres every year and are preparing for impacts in the sector itself that will further limit funding for already over-employed services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, endangered workers, victims of violence, and people without funds to fight unfair evictions, etc. - are already being rejected when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to burst, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
The director of community legal aid centres in Queenslad, James Farrell, said that according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community legal aid centres, it was found that 5,000 people are rejected every year.
Mr. Farrell said that without the federal government's decision being abrogated, the situation would deteriorate.
"The Community legal aid centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped relationships with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families who are separated, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, leading to thousands of threatened Queensland people having to find their way into complex legal problems without help.
We call on the State's Attorney and Senator Queensland George Brandis to prevent this cutback immediately, so that people get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
Over the past year, the government has fulfilled its commitment to ensuring the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community's legal aid centres and the community of their clients, and Palaszczuk's government must invest in this important work.
Action for Donald Trump's campaign after a member of staff allegedly pointed a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for alleged inactivity after being informed that the director of operations in North Carolina in February pointed a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep.
The incident was described in a court file handed over by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software trainer in the state, at Charlotte State Court on Wednesday.
Bordini said that for months he had been waiting for the situation to be resolved internally before he came to the conclusion that “this would not happen.”
Director Earl Phillip “stamped the gun with his fingers, put the right index finger on the trigger and pointed the barrel at Vincent's kneecap,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file states that Bordini, following complaints from local and regional campaign management, found that at least four others had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"The guns don't have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate has caused a stir when he told voters in North Carolina that they could intervene owners and arms holders (which is regulated in the US in the Second Amendment of the Constitution) if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and can appoint a judge.
Trump's campaign says the media ripped his words out of context and that Trump didn't advocate violence.
Bordini in the lawsuit asks for compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and Phillip for endangering personal security, unlawful use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump's spokesman Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the comment request.
The attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news branch in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one responded in a short time to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is leading a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of restoration and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is in a huge way attractive, just as London 2012 was, when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games have made huge contributions to both Startford and East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching posts, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who will think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would be mocked on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of £211 billion, a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the UK.
We have a great team on Heathrow, which, in terms of time and budget, introduced an infrastructure investment program worth £11 billion, starting with the T5 terminal - which was elected by the world's best terminal five years in a row, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success for Great Britain and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be one too.
It is time for us to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trade in the future and leave behind the legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Business Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in cat and mouse game blocking ads
Attempts to bypass advertising programs have turned online marketing into a game of cat and mouse. At least so says one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a post on its website stating that users can update filters in their program and re-block advertising on this social network.
Facebook stated on Tuesday that its desktop website would change the coding around ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But Adblock now claims they've already bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the community of open source advertising blocking and those who try to bypass it has been going on since the advertising blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another repair of its own.
The fact that the company that owns the largest social network in the world has been involved in the war shows just how much of a problem blocking advertising for industry has become.
According to a study last year, Pagefair did it, and Adobe uses worldwide advertising filters of about 200 million people - almost four times as many as it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of Facebook advertising profits, every day Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users.
A spokesman said that the company goes against advertising filters on desktops, because mobile filters for mobile applications for social network and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on desktops still represents a profit high enough that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it would update the tool for "ad preference" to give people a better chance to control how ads are displayed.
On Thursday, Facebook said that the new Adblock filters concerned them because they could also block content that is unrelated to advertising.
"It is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," Facebook spokeswoman said in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, which is why we prefer to focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences, which will give people control.
A woman was hit by a Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an event during which a woman was probably tried to commit suicide on the highway of several cars on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in Vaud Canton shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The Vaud police reported that the actor of the "desperate act" was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
Clearly, the victim, a woman at the age of 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but according to the police, not all of them have been identified. Police are calling on these drivers and all others who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, told Le Tribune de Geneve attorney Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
That's what the prosecutor has to find out," said Hofstetter.
On the basis of two similar cases of the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspapers said.
Last year, a police officer was relieved of charges for negligent manslaughter after she hit and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne in August 2014.
In court, it was said that a 22 - year - old victim was drinking alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was driving in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone with information about a Thursday incident at Morges should log in to the police at the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination of LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agents and Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
On Friday, the CEO of AČCKA Kateřina Petříčková told us.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival brings life closer to lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses," Petříčková said.
According to a survey by organizers, foreign visitors spend CZK 3100 a day per person on average.
Gay tourists are provided with special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, interested in stays in higher price relations with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium takes place this year as part of the festival programme.
It is lectured by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14th.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The top of the festival will be a traditional parade on Saturday with allegorical cars that will go from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
This year, the parade, attended by thousands of people in recent years, honors a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat are 40 years old.
The indisputable handymen Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained both small and large viewers for 40 years.
The pilot of this evening series by director Lubomír Beneš was premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known by viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, were cartoons by artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who designed for a magazine with two DIYs by Mr Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the dramaturge Jiří Kubíček and artist Vladimír Jiránek to cooperate and together created the film Kuťáci.
Today's appearance with a yellow and red trick and a kulich and radio was given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak television began to be created in the Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were given to the handymen in 1985, this time it was made directly for Short Film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other parts were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of whom were attended by Beneš' son Mark.
Today there are over 90 episodes with stories of these handymen, who are all in hand, but they are never angry at each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm and finally they are satisfied with their work, which will prove by the famous gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theatres and characters or other toys depicting Pat and Mat are the hits of every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is a fairy tale, we have chosen one sport and one life for you.
They both have a good ending.
Well, let's see.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the reason for the country’s joy?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And what things do people spend most on at airports?
That's a Friday review from the world's web site.
First medals from the Olympic Games.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
The Rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the UK team in the finals of the seven rugby Olympics.
It is the first medal Fiji has won for itself at the Olympics.
It took 60 years to wait for the first precious metal to be gained from the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
Big credit for success is given to Coach Fiji.
But it's ironic that Brit Ben Ryan is.
The team has been leading since 2013 and, after the finals as a British citizen, unlike his compatriots, he could be satisfied.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can make the biggest game in our history," said the coach before the finals.
In the end, Fiji was dominated, and a small country with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The French daily Le Monde reported.
A new friend and luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who's been living with no arms and legs since 11 months, got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," a two-year-old girl rejoiced as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off the doll's arms and legs and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year of life, and doctors gave it only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He's got perspective.
I saw her introduce herself to the other kids with the words "Hi, I'm Harmonie and I don't have hands, my mother delivered.
Look at the joy the doll has brought.
What do we spend most on at the airport?
CNN's findings show that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
The Hudson's travel essential store chain has published data for the last year, summarizing 10 products that customers buy most often in their shops at airports.
The water was sovereignly the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, eight placed in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large pack of M&M coconut-flavored candy.
And can you guess who's closing the first ten?
You can't eat the only thing mentioned above.
CNN says it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
The magazines include US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win. Murray and Bond were laughing.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have been reigning sovereignly in the category of twos without a helmsman for seven years and have also confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, a disparate couple switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing competition since 2009.
At the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, they scored 69th in a row on Thursday's final.
How are we different from the others?
We are simply prettier, joking Murray already during the Olympic regatta, when he had to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different than the others.
We're just practicing hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, said Murray already more seriously.
Their domination is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two-metre and a hundred-pound chaser, academically-looking Bond is five centimeters shorter and 15 kilograms lighter.
Moreover, they are of a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, Murray has, for example, had a charity boxing match.
That's why they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's getting on the boat, basically, with the fact that we can't lose.
Let's just go win.
I tend to think about what could go wrong, admitted Bond, who also demonstrated at the press conference that Murray was dominant in the crew.
He was the one who always answered first, and Bond waited for his opportunity.
On the water, however, he destroys his opponents with calm force.
They are moving at their pace, and although they are often not in the lead in the middle of the track, the opponents have not yet found the recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We're racing on a two-mile track and we never wanted to go the first mile to the top.
We're just trying to keep the pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said 34-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Cup.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the gold four without a helmsman.
It was after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later that they decided to switch to two without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, the greatest defeat of their careers seems to have been atoned for, and the dominance has been confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and we didn't ask questions.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure that we were mentally good at it, Murray said.
We know they're all trying to overthrow us.
We still have that target on our backs.
We're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA’s climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of the new NASA climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at the NASA Space Study Institute of Goddard have developed a model to study Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions similar to those on Earth could exist on Venus, whose surface is hot, water-free and saturated with CO2.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rate of rotation of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, Venus once seemed proud of a thin atmosphere similar to Earth, turning slowly.
The model also dealt with Venus's earlier topography.
On the planet, the areas were likely drier than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to control life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the sun, which was 30 percent more subdued.
"In the simulation of the GISS model Venus during slow rotation exposes his daily side to the sun almost two months at once," explained the scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This is how the surface is heated and the rain is created, creating a dense layer of clouds that act like an umbrella and shield the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus similar to the evolution that had previously been hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated, and water vapors were burned with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, and the only thing left is the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from his position as coach and vice president of Team Colorado Avalanche’s hockey operations as the reason he stated the impossibility of participating in the team’s decision-making process.
Executive Vice President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the last three years, I have been the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I spent a long and intense summer thinking about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the coach and vice president of hockey operations are consistent with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to earn 112 points and the first place in Central Division. But Colorado struggled with Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and over the last two years, the games did not always work out after the season.
The Avalanche team reached a score of 39:39:4 in 2015/2016 and missed five points to win the second wild card in the Western conference.
Goalkeeper Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
The North Sea oil rig workers are re-launching talks and interrupting the strike.
The leaders of the parties said that wage strikes for North Sea oil rig workers were interrupted while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the company of services for Wood Group oil fields sporadically occurred on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for resolving current disagreements," the statement states.
Starting next week, we will have a series of full-time meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent to protest wage cuts.
Wood Group reduced rates this year and paid its North Sea suppliers about 9 percent less because of negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would give the company scope to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has cut thousands of people off his payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in 10 countries to modernise its processes - immediately after a mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of the Scottish Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with union leaders to discuss one of the greatest labour disagreements of the generation that led to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital to the region’s economy.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some," he said.
For comparison, in 2016 nearly $1.4 billion of investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected, while the average for the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of the stars in Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's Space Telescope to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the speed of rotation of the stars from the Pleiades Cluster.
New data helps astronomers to understand why stars in the cluster spin at different speeds, as well as how turning times are related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star mass, its age and even history in its solar system," said Luisa Rebullová, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in clusters are now reaching adulthood and have been formed for over 125 million years.
Now it's turning the fastest.
At the maximum speed of rotation, these teen stars release huge amounts of starwind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the age of the star, it slows down its speed of rotation.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of distinguishable points on the stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotation speeds, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, bigger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" Pleiades we see that slower spinning stars are more massive, while those that spin the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebullová said.
Since the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
"The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, for younger and older stars," Rebullová said.
There's still a lot we want to know about how, when, and why the stars are slowing down their speed of rotation, so to speak, "hanging their dancing shoes on the nail".
Rebull and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the speed of rotation of Pleiades in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then would the Qualification Agreement not be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work without enrolling in specialization education after graduation?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now only a job available in a somewhat distant hospital, but in about six months there could be a vacancy in another place where I would like to work.
So I do not know how to deal with the situation for about six months, the question continues.
Matches Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with an employer - a hospital.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and can be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure that the costs incurred are paid in order to increase or enhance the qualification of an employee.
In the field of health, long-term pressure is being put on not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the mobility of healthcare workers at work, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No.95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional competence and specialised competence in the pursuit of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is expressly true that participation in specialization education is considered to be an improvement of qualification (not as an increase in it).
This means that the qualification agreement can be concluded under the Labour Code only if the costs amount to at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation nor does it provide for the obligation to apply for specialization education.
The law only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialization education.
However, the doctor is legally entitled to pursue the profession of doctor by completing the necessary university studies, although under legal conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation in which professional experience completed in another field of specialisation may be included in the specialization training of a doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant training programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the questionable situation.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it is advisable to consult the relevant Department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Occupations), since the Ministry of Health legally provides advisory and consulting services related to inclusion in specialization education and its course.
The Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member, also provides advice free of charge.
The doctors of the Syrian Halab are asking for intervention from the United States.
The United States has not made any effort to end the siege (insurgent parts of the city by government troops), and has not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, quoting from a letter addressed to the White House by AFP.
"We do not need tears, compassion, and even prayers; however, we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over East Halab to stop attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab will not be surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces supporting the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have announced that, from today on, they will stop every day for three hours strikes in the Halab region to allow safe passage through humanitarian convoys.
