Republican Party Strategy against Obama’s Reelection
Republican leaders have justified their policy by the necessity of combating electoral fraud.
But Brennan’s center calls such fraud a myth that electoral fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
Indeed, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US over the past ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, individual states are responsible for organising federal elections in the US.
And in this spirit, most US governments have been declaring new laws since 2009 that make the election or registration process difficult.
This phenomenon has seen a boom following the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives have been added in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the right to vote in 41 states were submitted only in 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present photo ID and evidence of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limit periods for elections ahead of time, invalidate the right to sign up on the electorate list on the day of the election, and withdraw the right to vote for citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state required a photo ID on voters.
Indiana was the first state to implement this request.
The constitutionality of the Indian law was confirmed in 2008 by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this process to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported proposals for such laws in 34 states to force voters to present photo IDs.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal ID card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people of the age allowing to vote, do not own any photo ID issued by the government office of their state.
Furthermore, it does not have such an identity card of about five million new voters in 2012.
Moreover, the purchase of the required identity card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected mainly by young people, minorities and low-income people.
25% African-Americans, 15% income under $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, are known for their attachment to democratic candidates, are not entitled to use their photo ID issued by their school in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs, who choose rather Republican candidates, to use the cards issued by these clubs in the elections.
Until 2004, no state had required proof of citizenship for elections.
Arizona introduced the first such request.
Since 2011, some 12 states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer a democratic party.
Republican legislation in 2011 supported laws in eight states that cancel voter registration on election day.
Moreover, they have limited the right of persons and groups to help voters who want to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the general elections in 2004, campaigns to register voters helped to register about 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% decrease in the entry of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican legislators then passed laws in the other five states aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, African-Americans accounted for 33% of the voters who voted in advance, even though there were only 13% of African-American voters in that state.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, white people, who represented 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have very strongly opposed the passing of laws restricting electoral registration.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even intervened.
In part, they managed to reduce the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
However, the newly introduced rules will make it quite undeniably difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics mainly talk about the bias of approved laws and consider them to be an obvious effort to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The report of the Brennan Centre in 2011 shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral body necessary for the victory in the presidential election.
It is too early to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: pass the exam or not?
The PSA test sometimes yielded false results that were wrongly negative or even wrongly positive, resulting in unnecessary medical interventions.
All this increased the hesitantness of men who were already so reluctant to go for an examination at all.
Get checked out or not?
We've asked for two experts' opinion.
Studies conducted in the USA showed a high level of contamination between the individual test groups, thus making it difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality rate between patients who had undergone the examination and those who had not gone to it.
This study also showed that those who are not on the test have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
I therefore recommend an examination from 50 years of age or 40 years of age if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
African - American men are also a more vulnerable group.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is exposed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and species that are indifferent.
It is therefore necessary to explain correctly to the patient the level of risk of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus on active disease surveillance in these cases.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not cured because their type of cancer is not aggressive and is not life-threatening.
Rather, we will suggest carrying out active supervision and offer them treatment in case of disease progression.
More and more often and with greater precision, we set criteria that help to decide which species to treat and which ones do not.
Still, I recommend that you pass the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to have an examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement created an instrument that allows to evaluate for and against the PSA examination.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, it seems the best means to limit disease risks to the adoption of healthy lifestyle principles.
It is estimated that up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided if everyone ate healthy and moved sufficiently.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would have risen to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian cancer research company.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer causes inheritance.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
The fight against smoking remains a priority for Canada’s cancer research society, even if the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely damaging to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson.
Encouraging information: 10 years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of death to cancer falls by half.
Weight
Body weight and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity for life protects against colon cancer," he adds.
Nutrition
That organisation also recommends reducing the consumption of red meat.
Too high in consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to avoid sausages for which the same applies.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to cancer development," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, different scientists have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet drawn clear conclusions.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies are contradictory.
Although one of these will reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks more of an increase in prostate cancer.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu further insists on the importance of talking about his family concerns and precedents with his doctor.
"To submit to an examination doesn't mean you'll have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And it's the last particle that the standard model predicts - our best or "at least wrong" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100% certainty among physicists that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the Great Physical Congress in Kyoto rather confirms it, but all data is still missing so that we can be absolutely sure.
However, suppose it is the Higgs boson, because the risks of error appear to be small, and let's see what it is.
In this world, there is an unquestionable law under which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantical state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
Next, they divide the physics particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find decent citizens, or fermions, who obediently follow Pauli’s principle.
And at the other end, there are bosons, evil anarchists, who don't appreciate anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can easily be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley laboratories: the mesons that we leave unnoticed, and the "force particles" that spread large natural forces and with which the Higgs boson is probably related in some way.
It must be said, however, that these bosons are not as exotic animals as they might be thought.
If you read this article, it is due to a boson with unusual banality: photon, or "particle of light", which is the "bearer" of electromagnetic force.
When particles with electric charge accelerate or change their direction, they "interrupt" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, similar to a pebble thrown into the pond.
This "interruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "power carriers".
More stable field
It's also with the Higgs boson, only with the difference that "interrupt" has to be another field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it is necessary to achieve very high energy values in order to excite it, just like the frozen pond level, only a very large boulder will pick up.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator part as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with friendly bundles is a circle with a circuit of 27 km! - in order to be able to develop such energy.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field will be useful again to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
With the electromagnetic field, neither all particles nor all materials react.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself on the fridge.
And yet, with the Higgs field, all particles do not react: those that do have a mass, while others (such as the photon, let's look at it) do not.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what are all these researches for, what are they going to "bring us"?
From a scientific point of view, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancy between observations and forecasts of SM.
Moreover, few physicists literally wish that they could be found, because the slightest difference could open the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge shortcomings, it does not bring any clarification of gravity (dense!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the space mass (again ouha!).
However, CERN has not yet found such contradictions.
Responses
The responses of these researches in Mr Novák's daily life can only be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
Behold: at the very beginning of the 1960’s, laser pioneers in Bell’s laboratories had no idea of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physics Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I already said - the laser was initially considered such a "toy for the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application may result from all the tools surrounding research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle didn't plan it at all at first, now serves as the "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that you really never know...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... ? Le Devoir
Through his Commission for Decent Dying, Quebek recently became involved in a delicate issue about the end of his life.
The debate should continue shortly and the bill is being drafted.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to take a closer look at the issue.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which consumed him, granted him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years to live and it's already seven," he says without emotion on his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The illness has done its work: an immense weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just to eat himself.
He looks down on a tasty - looking breakfast, and he agrees that we will help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop by, bringing him medication, offering him a bath.
Courage to an ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"A man learns throughout his life that men urinate standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Going back to the child stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"Depends on the abilities of the man", says the psychologist.
In the opinion of a number of people dealing with palliative care, crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients entering a home with palliative care, Victor-Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is at most three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who take care of them do not provide so-called "healing" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die of "suffocation in full consciousness".
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in my life," she says, and then she allows us to put her breathing apparatus on.
Yet he is still looking forward to his last visit to his son from Italy in the following days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with the help of nutrition.
That's what palliative care looks like when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, a single bed of palliative care covers 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize we're all gonna die someday.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, he can be given a sip of brandy or pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetic patients no longer need to monitor their blood sugar levels.
And death is a part of everyday life here.
Last night, they were carrying a beer to Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savardová, director of nursing services.
In Victor-Gadbois' home, days go by days, but they don't look like each other.
In addition to a 32 - year - old man who rejoices in his last encounter with his family thoroughly based on pillows while toasting to him in his honor, a tragically 36 - year - old man surrounded by his parents, wife, and two young children dies after he has tried every opportunity to survive.
"There are always three to five beds for people with cancer under the age of 45 for six months," says Dr. Christiane Martel, concerned.
53% of the patients who come to home Victor-Gadbois come here from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that is designed to alleviate suffering once the sick reach the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this crucial unavailability of medical care in Quebec that many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of the euthanasia and assisted suicide law.
Since October, the manifesto has been in circulation, signed by peaks in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their disapproval of such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebek medical system is not powerful enough to provide access for all persons to high-quality palliative care before euthanasia can be carried out.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in an emergency room in tremendous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
They fear that patients should not be asked to be killed because they are not given appropriate care.
At the same time, many oncologists care for their patients until the last few moments, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she replied that she regretted stopping fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their treating physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative cunt team eased their pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of Palliative Care in the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which will put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether by impact or whether the sedative is administered permanently.
We can't pretend to ignore this part of the suffering.
A patient we can't relieve from pain will still have more access to palliative sedatives.
Sick people who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to provide me with euthanasia," it means "I want you to relieve my pain."
A grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research enabled the implementation of this report.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel administrations, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists and Italian mafia experts are still telling what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafias mix.
This "branch" came very expensive to the Queen's taxpayers, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has dissipated since we have taken major measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, the Quebek MP and former chief of police in Montreal, ironically.
Thanks to him, a scandal broke out in 2011 on the basis of a rigorous investigation aimed at embezzlement of funds in connection with road construction contracts in Quebec, which were approved by then liberalquebek Prime Minister Jean Charest after long delays.
The "Duchesneau report" confirmed a direct link between industry, the opaque financing of the parties and the corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "the Department of Transport has saved a billion dollars in commissions," when some people have kept their instincts in check to get a cut in them!
Charbonneau's commission "has already led two mayors to resign," adds with the hope that they will "discover the subtlety of some people".
Standing Unit for Combating Corruption Founded in 2011
A permanent anti-corruption unit founded in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the officers of the "Marteau Company", who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal "Money Canal Card" significantly mitigates the inflating of orders...
In recent weeks, a number of tours have been conducted and charged with fraud and corruption by a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a village in the suburbs.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He's suspected of repeatedly taking bribes in exchange for public procurement.
Formal accusations have also been received by traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia.
Lino Zambia created a sensation by explaining to the Commission the "system" mechanism for obtaining public procurement.
During these years, he himself devoted 3% of the value of the orders he received in Montréal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
Zambia was generous to all parties after 2000 and devoted more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately EUR 68,000) to the provincial parties, but in particular to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organising illegal fundraising for former liberal Vice Prime Minister Nathalie Normanddeau.
Contracts with cash pipelines whose prices were higher
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surfrenant, a former transport engineer, described him very closely before the commission: within ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches, and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with cash pipelines, where he exaggerated the prize.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they had paid rewards for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through untrue multi-laboration.
Martin Dumont, the mayor’s party organizer, then accused Tremblay of staring at the parallel budget that brought dirty money into his cash register.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned early in November, thus throwing Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Priries district on the east of the island, since 2010, she has been arguing against the sale of a local land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of the money in election campaigns
About the investigation that will finally be initiated, he says that he's pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the ant-infested system to stop gangrene and catch the culprits.
According to her, the process is "painful but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to set up our own investigation unit in Montréal and to ensure that these questionable practices cannot go back.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have alienated hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "messagers informed of this trick", unless they are involved in these tricks!
He estimates that 70% of campaign funding in Quebec comes from dirty money, and he adds with irony: "I hear it's just a weak taste of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to $100, but he says that this will not solve the situation: 'Until the electoral spending is strictly limited, the dirty money from politics will not go away.'
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of parties: 'We can no longer fall below; if we boldly focus on the substance of things, we can build again on stronger foundations and with greater control and compliance'.
If this story defiled the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends to all who mock him to look at his own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went together, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players came to us.
Every day, I get further along with them.
The tech team helped me a lot, too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier when you fight.
Everything goes so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in the preparation school in INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I always moved on by degrees.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
The reinforcements from this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the game and wants to give maximum performance.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makelele, who used to play the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians.
Today he has no equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's gonna win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a calming conversation with him.
I've had a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our front position.
But we're staying behind.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have made very easy progress to the eight-finals.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group before Port so we can play in the eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget's already...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make history.
That is not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this project happen.
And would it be a big failure not to win in the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We've been missing a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had the strength to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think we're gonna make it this year.
Although large teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are also seeking the title, I think we have the weapons to defeat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us given what's been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat Troys 4:0 at home and there's still something in the paper that we're being blamed for, it's not very pleasant.
You ask what more people want from you.
Of course, you can't win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
At the Champions League, we proved we could play.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't made it to the eight-finals in the second season, and they've invested a lot of money!
Given the sums invested, you'd be expected to have a head start over the other 15 points!
That insults other clubs and the French League.
The Lyon and Marseille clubs, which did not do very well last season, moved on to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the First League is.
I hope that we will be able to smile in May and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have succeeded in winning.
PSG seems to rely on Zlatan Ibrahimovich's performance in everything.
It's a good thing they say there's a "dependence on Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovich is very powerful and that he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here, proving he's a major league star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
In our team, we respect both man and player.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he has accomplished is truly extraordinary.
This has led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside each other.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with your French representation?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as much as I'd imagined.
But I've been there, and I've come out stronger.
Today I also manage to play good matches in the representation.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be exemplary.
How do you feel about the first months of Didier Deschamps leading the national team?
The results speak for him.
We're in a good place to qualify for MS.
Coach picks hard, he's close to the players, and he's very excited to win.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the tie (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting game?
This fight gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have never experienced such a struggle in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true in these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (transferable to dollars, euro...), as well as a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The Bitcoin exchange rate first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to $2, today it is at the border of about $10 (the course overview is shown on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world's exchange for real money or financial products, it's nothing impressive.
Yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this in its report on virtual finance published in October.
Bitcoin calls 'the most successful virtual money', 'the competitive dollar and the euro' and 'a period of ordinary money'.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money by being like "credits" used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
Facebook's social network also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all network nodes are depositories of current accounts, controllers, money issuers and buyers as well as sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The information set related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the validity of the transaction.
Furthermore, thanks to the file content, it is possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of current accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction into this book.
It is done by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers, whose solver, a temporary central banker, will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is a file cutting phase; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then they "cut" the whole thing.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other knots will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then indestructibly displayed connected to the string of all other transactions; any modification would change the print.
If the user wanted to pay twice the same money very quickly in a row (in 10 minutes), the network will only confirm one of both transactions - the other will be abandoned because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is regularly shared by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited by 21 million, but it can be divided into 100 millionths, so there is room for margin...
The difficulty of the given task is also increasing with increasing level of calculation.
The network has seen its ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
"The used loophole does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls money laundering capabilities through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, as a WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, "big discounts" were launched.
"30,000 dollars has been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to transform bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless cell phone payment, but he uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that make it cheaper.
Moreover, the carrier manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set for traders where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just give the address that can be "photographed and identified" by the phone, specifies Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
The general movement is being questioned by hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
"It will be a while before Bitcoin succeeds, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB envisages a reassessment of the various risks considered to be increased today if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US troops should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside that we punished suffered the greatest harm because we considered them terrorists.
And so are we, after all, we lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often are peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks have joined them.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent assistance from local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The departure of the French troops from the foundations of Nijarab, which I watched from the tops of the almond mountains thanks to French loans, went smoothly.
Truck convoys and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by helicopters.
Since the end of 2014, Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable procedure between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the country was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different resistance groups.
Their taking control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these peasants, which was completely dominated by Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved until our time.
The former mujahedins, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban agree in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
Major dignitaries from the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seized state land, sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge US contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were never even in combat.
From what I've heard in campaigns, people want a government that won't be made by thieves.
A number of young people want to leave just as those who have been able to make use of American generosity will leave: capital leakage is considerable.
The young are tired of war and the ideologies associated with it.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they came to know the modern world and were intrigued by its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25; 5 million people currently live in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
The cities are full of public schools, girls and boys go there.
These young people will need work, they do not want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes cell phones; television and Turkish series that show the modern world watch everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that take her lead be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy some degree of decentralization in the form of Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister that existed since the constitution was adopted in 1964 was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier years.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam works, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced but fruit and vegetables.
The priority is a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government infrastructure control would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral resources.
And it just made the feeling that the Western states were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without resources to transport raw materials through mountains, however, no mining of minerals can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine Mes Aynak and left international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist area in order to retain the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of both imports and exports depend, will also need to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of common forms of assistance: girls' and boys' lycea, French departments at universities, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, there has been an initiative to "get your heart and soul" attempting to reconcile aid and military activities, in which the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) worked, which was abolished in 2012, but achieved a number of achievements in the field of common interest and steps for agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages thanks to a small French non-governmental organisation.
These work involving a number of local workers helped to dampen the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and the expansion of the cultivated area.
What memory do we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the local living conditions that are very demanding in these valleys, which are often above 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural assistance from local communities in the province of Cape.
In order to free themselves from the uprisings led by foreign groups, these farmers wish, in their own words, to achieve a small amount of civil aid for their benefit, which would be properly controlled and directly touched.
Difficult Work at the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Morsi has embarked on another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the constitution, which temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of everyone else, that the Constitutional Assembly will approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been added many times, weakening the country’s constitutional stability and leading to legal speculation.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country’s diversity.
From the opposition's point of view, the President remains in his 'autocratical delirium', continues to 'broke his word' and 'paves the law'.
However, its supporters assure that it is a means of turning the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transition process.
There should be a referendum in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of explaining the text to the Egyptians by article.
For the President, it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country is being torn apart by protests.
As confirmed in an interview for the American weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially because this hastily organised vote puts the Egyptian people in front of the ultimatum: 'You either approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers', which should otherwise end after the adoption of the new constitution.
And in this particular climate, 85 Members of the above-mentioned Constitutional Assembly approved the text with a large majority of Islamists yesterday.
Most liberals were absent in the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was announced, they slammed the door saying they didn't have a chance to assert their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have imitated their actions.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 alternates were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further considered that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... the hours for prayer, when some committee members felt that the hours in the meeting room were not properly adjusted.
The text voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains ultimately identical to the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the Sharia Law Principles are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term 'principles' with the term 'rules', which would allow stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
" Hypocrisy", objected to liberals who see it only as a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers an advisory role on the University of Al-Azhar, in particular on matters of checking compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because 'persons called to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It can be seen as the beginnings of theocracy".
The fear of liberals is even more fueled by the fact that the next president of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there has been no concrete religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulamians, but university workers, many of whom have graduated from French schools," Alexis Blouet, who prepares work on the constitutional transition in Egypt, is mildly concerned.
However, they agree that "there may be contradictions about the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong in the religious dictionary.
There is, in particular, a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic Legal Science, Note Red.]
And in the future, there may be a question of the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment on this."
Yesterday's approved text is, in addition to religious sites, highly criticized because of the extended powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been significant restrictions on them against the former regime.
Another disputed place: the powers vested in the army.
In accordance with the wishes of military officials, verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, civil proceedings will not be banned in military courts, as requested by the Human Rights Association.
These associations are talking about their doubts about the text that they believe is directed against freedom.
The act of blasphemy is maintained and the insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In its view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the president of Egypt was scheduled to appear in a television address last night, there are manifestations scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will then show up on Saturday.
In Israel waiting for Ukrainian tourists holy places, navel world and sea from saturated salt solution
The promised land combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the integrity of nature.
AaF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Bowing to Holy Places
To visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that all those who enter this "bath" will be brought down by God's mercy.
And Galilee - instead of Jesus' miracles: the transformation of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most sacred places are in Jerusalem.
The believers here will pass through the Path of Pain, or Jesus ’ Cross Way (Via Dolorosa in Latin).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the judgment took place, it passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's Grave on Mount Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian belly of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made a cross for Jesus ’ crucifixion.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for Jews - the wall of wailing, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different religions leave notes with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Make your way through the vertical
The ruins of Masada remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 B.C.E.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who engage in climbing can reach it by their own means.
The others will take the cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous Hermon ski resort, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists from the bottom of the hill to this ski paradise.
The total length of mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived at the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth a visit.
In his exhibition, his canvases are widely represented by impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which presents visitors to several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with mannequins of spa users and spa attendants from that time.
In Caesarea is worth visiting the unique private museum Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vash in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and you find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are glistening.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died are spoken.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve Your Health
The three main resorts of Israel are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, delfinarias and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea can be bathed even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe all year round.
By the way, the dead sea is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest land point of the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated saline solution that can easily keep on the surface and people who can't swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using salt water - brine, and medicinal mud that can treat the health problems of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure your nerves.
Touch the mysterious past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them was the famous maritime route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The references to this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life together.
Indeed, the tourists love to wander through narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you press the walls in the alley of "your" sign, happiness will favor you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get a picture.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "conquer" the fortress of crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontius.
The carefully renovated theatre is today used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the Russian population speaks.
It is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now $1 is approximately 3.8 shekels).
Buses are mainly urban transport, but there is a express tram in Jerusalem, and in Haifa there is only one metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper one.
It's basically an underground cableway.
Travelling by all kinds of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can transfer 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, he ceases to work in marketplaces, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning's work week.
In many cafés, restaurants and hotels, you can only get kosher meals: except pork, seafood, fish without scales and meals containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various kinds of sauces, ground chickpea balls - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israel.
But there are very many fattened cats who are "wandering according to their taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The forward cats love the crowded places and with a taste they go into every goodness.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 per day (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
On average, museum tickets cost 30 shekels.
Expressed by numbers
More than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
To get to know the country and relax came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised country visited from January to October 2012 at 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on their language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language testing, frauds have already appeared in the country who sell "forgery" certificates
13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg, and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenie.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into force, according to which each working migrant would be obliged to pass an examination of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, residential and municipal sectors, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that in time the tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the trials will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the basics of law.
Knowledge of the language will also have to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is also not subject to people who have successfully achieved certification and obtained an academic diploma in the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, convictions and protection of rights
The network of test posts will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass exams in all cities; already more than 160 such centres are open in Russia.
Members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services) also supported the initiative to support the introduction of testing.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask many times in the press the question: and what will it really bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all - the representatives of the migration service - will be able to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "slave labour."
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains President of the FMS Board of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should start before they leave.
Only the organised recruitment system will allow 90% of the problems of foreign workers to be solved.
Problems arise in jobless immigrants, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says Sebelev with conviction - a future immigrant is sentenced to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, provide a "injunction" to terrible, tight hostels in which he and dozens of others like him will suffer for months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their homeland they promise them one thing, but on arrival they will cheat them, confiscate their passports, do not pay their promised wages," says the head of the Main Tajik Administration of Labour Migration MS Tolib Šripov.
Don't swear!
The less that many Central Asian citizens who intend to work in Russia acknowledge that they do not only know the language of the country they want to get to, but do not even have experience with the work.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as it is their misfortune: very few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to obtain at least an adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be decently dressed, put on clothes, and equip themselves for school.
As children grow up to a productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without language knowledge, it's hard to admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, in the light of the law on language testing, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out on those migrants with legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even take exams or get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally in Russia as they used to.
"Welcome, or not allowed."
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police employees know that we have basically fake documents, no registration, and that leads to blackmail cases.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Chuškadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, shared his experience with journalists.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy yourself a painting."
On the first day of the validity of the language law, it was found that not only migrants’ registration documents were false.
FMS employees have already confiscated several false certificates of completion of the language examination.
The forged documents are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each migrant paid 7,000 rubles for this document in the hope that it would facilitate the problem of passing tests.
That is two and a half times the amount of the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to secure the system from corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, in which the government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Meanwhile, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed the tests for the first time the necessary time to take a course on the basics of Russian language.
Visitors who do not know Russian are expected to work in areas where active dealing with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of Interior) does not circulate the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
Russia’s MVD is proposing to tighten the law in relation to civil arms owners.
This is the response of government authorities to recent events: the trigger was shootings at weddings without victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow’s attorney Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
The police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can get a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years of age.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who has promised that amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem through the "screw tightening".
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "unsensical tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, stated Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the BBC Russian editorial.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes from the use of firearms registered by the Ministry of Interior were committed in six months 2012, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the civil arms legislation will not force the perpetrators to switch to the "black" market.
According to their words, any weapon can currently be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Home Office claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The Black Arms Market is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says the retired colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years at the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages that accept orders of weapons
The first one - "army or military journey", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and caucasians themselves," Baranec says.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from security officials.
Barance explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement agencies in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" get sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It is proven that some fires were set intentionally - to cover up the manka," says the former soldier.
Barance and the arms manufacturers make their contribution.
"Private arms companies are currently being created that are not competitive on the international market, and they are eliminating weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their production, sometimes weapons are made in small-scale production, and there's a mafia that organized their smooth production," ex-military explains.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have added up the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons in the "black" market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
The specialists discussed reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminology literature and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, reported by researchers, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all the weapons found themselves on the black market "the guilt of officials whose work is linked to weapons," says the report.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons are from armed conflicts, 14% of the cases of weapons being stolen during their production, 5% of them are "black archaeology".
The gun dealer-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archeologists" no longer buy - are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers drive for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
The ensign buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him, and he sells it to you through the fence.
"He will carry her into town and sell her there for 900 euros a piece with two stacks," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore whenever their plan starts to burn in the clarity of criminal offences, they will carry out a check purchase with illegal arms dealers," the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The sellers often find each other through their acquaintances with the buyer.
I was visiting websites and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Test" platform, where there would be a man who would lead me to the "top" where we'd be negotiating.
I learned the prize mainly from there.
Military correspondent Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows his way out, a salesman tells the story. I have a friend like that, but I don't fully trust him.
The sellers are on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell my daughter that a tooth had fallen out."
And now I'm going to get there through the person I'm sure of.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't turn him in.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he processed the state to publish on this topic.
The schematics, according to his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album that said "everything you thought about."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalls the soldier.
The buyer, in the words of Baranec, is not offered a rabbit in a sack - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller into the woods and we build a target.
"They will give me the opportunity to shoot, and if I can make sure that the gun shoots well, we are beginning to act," the expert describes.
Container on the sofa
The search engines will bring you to the web pages and groups on "In Contact", where they offer to buy a weapon "for different purposes".
It does not require any documents or personal meetings.
"All you have to do is have a set amount of money," says the ad headline on the website "Buy a fighting gun or a vending machine".
Users leave their notices on this website and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course without a license," the user asks "Ivan" (the document is preserved).
"I buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently threw away a huge network of planted websites, and persons wishing to buy a military weapon can pick up a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish to bait and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military Rapporteur and Senior Military dignitary Viktor Baranec
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make a payment via the ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photograph and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," says the spokesperson for the NGO "Right to Gun" Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website you can stay unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

Macarov for $100
When you buy an illegal firearm, you usually pay from $100 to $900, according to experts' estimates.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "Right to Gun" you'll get a Makarov pistol for $100 to $300.
You have to wait for a month and a half.
The weapon is dispatched from the warehouses to the long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle cell.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% compared to the period January - October 2011 and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fastfood and supermarket workers strike in the USA
Working at the box office of "McDonald" will pass up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, protests have risen in America against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and popular fast food chains such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a wave of nine, or whether it is destined to perish soon.
The entire stock is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries that ordinary workers receive in Walmart and in fast food systems, protest organizers aim to achieve in them creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "black Friday", when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, seized millions of people, and in some cases was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart workers, working at 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists from multinational companies of business chains whose goods are intended for people of the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many employees with low wages in Walmart stores only buy at their work.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply because he pays very little of his employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or hand scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded a raise and complained that the health insurance costs provided by the company increased sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
Typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn't correspond to the cost level, says the employees.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves the increase in wages fully to consumer arms, every visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than today.
Walmart’s advocates point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and should not cause virtually any damage to the company.
The "Black Friday" at the company's stores lasted from 8:00 p.m. in the evening on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5000 items of goods per second.
Overall, her cash registers carried out almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
In an interview for the Huffington Post’s left-wing website, Dan Fogelman’s representative stated that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was all about "an additional media sensation" organized by the unions.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart stores (those in that progressive city are not very popular, and therefore almost not there), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Councillor
Currently, the minimum wage for work is $7.25 per hour in accordance with federal law and New York State regulations.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wage, but only slightly, and on average their staff in New York gets $8.90 an hour.
In this precious city, no one has lower wages.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter after school and live with their parents will go through the job at "McDonald".
Few people see their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
At present, I am constantly meeting with the "McDonald" workers who complain that they must live on this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
The protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonalda" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs at fast food companies start receiving at least $15 an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also called for trade unions to be set up in the fast food sector.
American laws prohibit the administration from preventing the establishment of trade unions and punishing trade union activists by bullying and firing.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
However, it is also difficult to introduce trade unions in fast food businesses for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high staff fluctuation.
Disagreement
On this day, loud protests were also held in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the event was at noon the assembly at "McDonald" near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians spoke, especially a member of the Jumaane Williams City Council, who said, "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then doesn't pay you sick and pay you properly for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also received support from other prominent New York democrats, such as the candidate for mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must speak together to support fast food workers in order to achieve the fair reward for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the biggest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people attended it, although not all of them were fast food workers who employ tens of thousands in New York City.
Whether this event will become a spark that will ignite the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain manages to deceive on average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technology is a popular theme of extended reality; lately it means to perceive the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google presented a working model of this news and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a request for the patent.
An interview with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadi shows that glasses are already a thing of the past for scientists in this company.
It attracts them perspective of manipulation with virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creation of virtual public spaces.
Please tell us, in general, what is your research group up to?
We're dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time, we're trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
Meanwhile, humanity is stuck in the phase of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes touching the screen with its finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone is a very interesting gesture control option.
What else is in the future for us?
- Not to mention that Kinect has transferred interaction to a physical level, very many interactions are still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has not yet been separately.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, for this purpose it is necessary to know not only the users, but also the space around them.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more suitable form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overestimated?
- Surely it cannot be considered a panacea - a question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our area about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling equipment in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not squishy ones, just such squishy ones, short ones.
The gesture would not be taken with a camera device, but with a bracelet to monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be very difficult to tell.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what a machine can or can't do at the moment?
- That's not necessary, but it's a rapprochement.
I think in the near future we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you are to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation - that's what we can bounce back from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1,000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's the math and the depth.
At the present point of view, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also the Z axes.
So the velocity is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Bethis made our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with current, series-produced sensors closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of a person with a machine.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some extra frames per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- The Kinect system now uses three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of a reflected signal.
And already the third camera - this is actually a common sensor of the visible band.
It's not used to determine the depth of an object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, to play with the curvature of the camera location and see how this helps in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall correctly, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not publicly present his glasses.
Don't you think that when it comes to everyday use of enhanced reality technology with special glasses, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "portable" form of an extension of reality, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphones at any time, projection screen and around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in which their strength (private things you see only), and at the same time weakness - widespread reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that widespread reality - that is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think complementing tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is being used - using the second hand as a kind of background for displaying.
He records the compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tactileness to these "images in the air" - for example, interference of several directional ultrasound rays at the defined point where the finger is located, causing a tactile feeling, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on your fingers.
There is also a wristband that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To make him think he feels what he seems to feel when he sees something at the moment?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking through an open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all such as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain deception becomes a target, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to researchers - many things are in the very beginnings.
Vkusovian instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the project "Petrohradian avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are in charge, is an avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already significant figures of the art scene of St Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe without achieving all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here at the fashion pubs and at the openings.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they're exposed, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of purely social and philosophical Petrofrad storytellers, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man of the Saint Petersburg avant-garde of the late '80s and early '90s.
In addition to being a city person, his appearance on the streets brings a smile on the face of citizens, he enhances everyone's mood.
He recently took the bottle and became a St. Petersburg flanter because he had matured into this complex role with all his bohemian life, philosophy, and image.
Cyril, why are you walking around town all red and not yellow or turquoise?
- I chose red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that differs a little from gray is arousing aggression and arousing bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on making conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevský, where my works were exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
That's when the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and I couldn't understand the new, free types of artists.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, the post-Gazonevs, who led us to the "Pushkin 10", and there were no other waves.
It appeals to theatre, dress, music, all genres except the word.
And it all merged into your art clinic... - It was important for me to be at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best powers of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995, I took the place at Pushkinská 10, and there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, a home of the Bohemian bohemian.
There were born many: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Snura was brought with the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
Snur and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, dressed in tight leotards, in the middle of them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachténberg, so began his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the reverberation of Art Clinic.
This is where our workers and regulars left.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000 a survey was held in the press, the special prize was "People in our city".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination, I was named, ending my peak.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the present years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are today different things, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which topicality and pervasiveness are captured live.
I'm going to have a program show called the Russian Museum of Clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, it's painful and terrible to be that way today.
But in clowns, everything is wiped off, tragedy is taken.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by means of a totalitarian disguise in the order of order.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, orient themselves to external mechanics, not to inner man.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
- We saw you the other day as a town flanter. - The cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be, if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
At present, commercial, utility art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There's a breakdown of cultures.
Back in the day, people used to meet in groups, the bohemian loved one thing, the simple people.
Today everything broke down at the micro-company, today it's very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand viewers will come to Stasu Mikhailov!
- He's gonna get hit by fans, where the sexual social sphere is involved.
And 300 people come on cultural land, and 10,000 people don't come, and the result is less management, less money, everything's wasting away.
I've got fans, the point is, nobody fools them and breaks what's going on.
When I was young, I used to paint pictures that hung on a collector's wall along with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that people usually end with.
Today, people are often confused.
They say:Culture of the spiritual, culture of the consumer.
There is no consumer culture, that's from somewhere else.
I'm a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejecting money for drawing paintings.
And I'm for that kind of culture.
Cyril, what's the shortage in Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a term: an actor through culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the proper Tsars, this was not the case in everything, perhaps the Tsars did not understand culture very well, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St Petersburg who might be experts, but they are tucked in a corner somewhere, because they need great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right track.
It's tasteful today.
The same Erarta, but it is different that they sincerely say that we accept not all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is?
- Saint Petersburg - it's not the capital of culture, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's the right land.
And on our eve, art thrives poorly.
We need cultural land, but there are more writers in our country today than there are readers, that's wrong.
There are many people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, this layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashionable thing, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented on the basis of a grant from St.Petersburg
To give birth in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with earthlings on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the main question arises: how do you keep your family in weightless conditions or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think it's a big choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be mastered, even hypothetically.
"He is Venus and Mars," says a high-ranking scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, temperatures on the surface of Venus reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit [500 ° C].
It's only possible to live there at a high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Scientists with flora began to address the questions of reproduction in the universe.
Already half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insect was carried out into orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to verify how the embryo develops in a weightless state.
We're getting a perfectly normal bird at the exit.
But then trouble begins.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird must find support, must stand on its own feet and begin to move," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they don't find support, the birds fall chaoticly and make a thump.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds have completely lost their instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, within four days, they just died.
"We hatched birds twice, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," comments the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarch" with the animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
In the biosatellite "Bion" they'll only be beings of one sex.
There has been an experiment with rats that have been transmitted to space already gravitationally.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, cosmic rats gave birth to offspring.
But it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a difficult task.
When animals lose their usual environment, they simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens rules by abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkov's greatest danger was.
The most precious thing mankind has is a woman's body.
Our Tchaika has flown away, and no one on Earth could tell if they could make it to space.
Whether she can give birth to a baby after a flight like this.
"But no one has answered this question yet," says Vachtang Vačnadze, a veteran of the rocket-space sector.
In June 1964, more than a year after her flight into space, Valentina Tereshkova's first wife-cosmonaut gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolaev.
In 1988, the son of the second wife-cosmonaut Svetlana Savika was born, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts, born and raised by healthy offspring after long years.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous even in orbital years," says the cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection, and artificial gravity creation.
The CPK Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in zero-attraction conditions, astronauts develop the habits needed to work in open space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
Although water is a comfortable environment for adults, it is a natural element for young children.
Little ichtianders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the child being in the mother’s amniotic water for an average of 9 months and making it easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical, because only two weeks will pass from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath.
"That's very little for a child to forget," says the swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if a weightless condition is more natural for a newborn child, then for women, an inevitable gravity, an attractive force, is more natural.
In a weight-free state, the abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles, decreases the body’s ability to expel the fetus very quickly.
We can put that aside if muscle activity stimulators work during labor.
After all, it is possible that the birth takes place in a special chamber in which the mother’s organism expels the fetus.
"And what next?" asks Valery Polyakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the earth’s attraction does not affect the organism, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he can train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs to develop.
"If we go with you to an experiment that admits the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be completely unadapted to the local environment," predicts the head of the Bioethics Committee IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So giving birth to children in space today is just a theoretical question.
But there will come a time when they will become reality and when the earthlings will set out in their ships on a faraway planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Head of the SAO: Control of the bottling system failed because of politicians
The Czech Republic has good auditors and quality legislation in connection with public contracts, but it is limping in its application.
In an interview for Aktuálně.cz, so says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that is what I think is missing from us," Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions also indicate joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of incorrect practice, he describes Peter Nečas' approach to the so-called "squarc system".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not bother the entrepreneur with his controls - is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be set up in some way, and if it forbids something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the work of an office that is under an obligation to check and enforce obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties in which public procurement legislation was compared in both countries.
What exactly was that about?
It's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, the issue is that European legislation regulates how to deal with public contracts, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the control is not yet completed, we have found very interesting differences - in general, the legislation in our country is perhaps "higher and better", however, the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to pursue the application of the law itself.
What can this project do for you, what can it do for you?
Such joint control could help us to stop making efforts to refine laws, reduce and improve limits when this does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But we do not necessarily have to achieve that by lowering the limit on contracts.
Perhaps the system will be overwhelmed with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will be able to draw more easily from it than if the limit had remained higher.
You're talking about domestic problems with transposing public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the board here similar to our SAO, or is it set differently?
As for the authorities, just as the SAO works there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a College, but it is formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities proceed similarly.
The powers are also to some extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, it also has these accounting courts at the level of individual Länder - in this way the system differs a little from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, represented by state resources.
Public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities in our country, are controlled there from the level of federal accounting courts.
As far as the legislation is concerned, it's easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better at everything.
Is it necessary, then, that they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it has to be said that even the countries we consider to be a model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be any good for them to work with our office, would it?
As far as domestic legislation is concerned, what was the amendment to the Public Procurement Act for your office, have its effects been reflected in any way?
Since the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet reflected in the controls.
Since we're doing ex post checks, there's a certain delay to be taken into account.
We have only observed this so far in the process of preparing future controls - we have started our new tool 'risk detection of inefficiency', through which we have driven almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - that is where the changes will, of course, manifest themselves, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted and so on.
Do you therefore consider the approval of this law to be a benefit or a further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will be confirmed.
A problem that may arise here, that the rules will become "tough" and will not be able to be followed.
Already in operation of previous rules, controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the effect that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is the law worth tightening up in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, not punish those who commit formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't go.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not bother the entrepreneur by controlling the so-called 'squarc system' - and what does that mean?
The shoe system is forbidden or allowed?
After all, the law has to be set, and if it forbids something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the work of an office that has a duty to control and enforce obligations.
He can say, "Let's change the law and allow it," but he can't say we'll act like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are rather strict rules on what is to be formally done - which is right to protect competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that a candidate with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what I think is missing from us.
The roads are frosted, but mostly mobile
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
Most of the time, however, the roads are mobile, somewhere with caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region, the roads were rolling this morning, but sometimes frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should warm slightly.
The snowing in the region has stopped and the lowlands lie only a weak layer.
On the ridges of the Erzgebirge, however, there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
There was also lower visibility due to fog, resulting from data dispatch of regional roadmen.
The R6 expressways and first class roads are now mobile in the region without restrictions.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frosted and slippery.
All roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads, are also mobile.
On them, however, there are still remains of frozen snow and snow in some sections.
Especially in higher positions, extra attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubicky and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of icing, in higher positions and on the mountains there may be a travelling layer of snow on roads, it informs on its website the Directorate of Roads and Motorways.
Roadmen warn the driver of icing, it can be formed especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice Region.
The ice can be around Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Police, Svitav or Vysoké Myto, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitav.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia it is most often clear and half clear without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, with weak wind blowing.
Plzensky Region
The roads in the Pilsen Region are mobile this morning, but in some places with caution and the ride needs to be adapted to the weather.
This is freezing in the morning, temperatures are between three and nine degrees below freezing.
After previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication may be frozen.
The seats must be reckoned with by the driver with the fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is based on information from the dispatch of the regional roadmen.
The D5 motorway is mobile almost without limitation, however, the communication administrators recommend increased caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
But there may be frosted sections in the south of Pilsen and Tachov.
The communication of the second and third classes is damp and in this case also the frosted sections are alerted.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent journeys in the area of Šumava.
Olomouc Region
Today, drivers heading for the highest positions of the Olomouc Region must count on snow mash on the road.
After chemical sprinkles remained on the Red Mountain saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videl Cross.
Roadmen were driven into the field by snow at night, in Šumpersk according to the road managers they snowed about three centimetres.
In other parts of the region, roadways are usually mobile without restrictions.
"In Šumpersku there are remnants of snow in the highest positions.
With snow mash on Červenohorské saddle, drivers must count in the direction of Jeseník," he said today.
In the field at night their colleagues went to Jesenick, the roads up to and top positions are now, according to them, after chemical treatment bare and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are accessible without restrictions, but in Šternberk drivers should be careful in forest sections, where the roads remain wet.
Ústí Region, Liberec Region
Several hard-to-go places are reported by roadmen in the north of Bohemia this morning.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice to Ústeck is closed, it follows from the police database.
Temperatures are also held in lower positions below zero, so the ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
There are no operational complications reported yet.
The appearance of the iceberg is reported by roadmen especially from the surroundings of Szczecin.
According to meteorologists, at night the ideal conditions for her - during the day rain and melting snow, at night were clear and frosty.
Unfavorable conditions are also reported from the main moves on the I/13 road on the border between the Ústí Region and Liberec Region.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice forced bent branches of trees that bent to the ground under the snow.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we people like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a national benefit we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
Three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will take place at the same time on December 20th at 9:00 p.m.
They will end around the time of the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we worked everything out together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to gathering enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to consider, together with the public, the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of shoe items, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase at www.e-tap.cz can also support us.
The Tap Tap together with other performers also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancelled".
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if we succeed and the end of the world does not happen...
It is sung by all performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems all of a sudden join in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The words to this song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the clip played by Tomáš Hanák, sings in it also Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, since we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We try to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What's the end-of-the-world profit?
The equipment of the barrier-free training centre Studeo, which we have been implementing for six years with the civic association Tap in Jedlicek Institute.
The students of Jedlička Institute regularly run out of teachers and are engaged in activities that entertain and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go as teachers themselves, so we try to enable them to do so.
As part of the completion of Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several musical groups and performers will perform.
How did you pick them out?
We've been trying to build a program that will reach out to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic events" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so here we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, while we are in the USA, would like to connect it to the performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these paths logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
We have five members in an electric cart, her carts have to travel in the luggage compartment, then, of course, we carry along a lot of cargo and tool boxes...
However, so far it has always been done without any problems, ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us, that I was surprised many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how the individual differs in barrier-freeness, public access to handicapped people and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in our country, we have just seen in Russia that everything in the East is still in its very beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric cart to move alone in the city center.
They don't even pay as much of a price as you prefer wheelchairs in an elevator.
Fortunately, civic associations are already forming there, which are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the other hand, do we still have more advanced countries to catch up on?
There's a lot of things we're always behind...
However, it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with heavy disabilities to move separately in public, to go to the bathroom, to the museum, wherever...
However, it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in which the Tap Tap and I are a bit ahead!
Respecting the public or being barrier-free is one thing, but only when we become significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will things change for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is very popular at the moment, but let's go back a few years what made you start it in 1998?
I joined Jedlicek Institute as a tutor, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I play a saxophone among other things, so I set up an interest band with a colleague.
And over time, as our host Ladya Angelovich says, it got a little out of hand (Laughter).
But the popularity has only come in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with famous singers and also to actively work on promoting the band.
We realized that a job that couldn't be seen was basically like it didn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it this high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is full of stuff where one imitates the other.
It's logical in a way, everything new is taken carefully and takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it's natural...
But the regret is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we must regret.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the resources to do so.
I'm saying that when people with disabilities do something, it's not just for them, it's for the whole company.
Did it also help that you are a strict boss, as many people have labeled you?
In order to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and require discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and a head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to take twice a week of rehearsals, go to prep school and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
Currently, the band The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people are leaving and coming, there's no stopping it.
Who has the will and taste, always has the door open with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21:00
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plánojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will connect with the telemost during the singing of the band The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational centre STUDEO at Jedlicek Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 have free admission tickets at Bohemiaticket presale
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of this European Space Agency as the second member of the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But Poland's journey to space began much earlier.
Before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were involved in space flights; but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I will recall the lecture by A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Entry into Space.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) kept the listeners cool and after years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirscha Prize for his entry into space in France.
The remembered Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of cosmonautism and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the dark side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925 a railway line was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was intended to be used to start a collision or to brake it.
The information about this drezín is only known from the period press.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to deal with missile missiles.
Research was provided by Komorka Techniki Ubrozenia in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from preserved materials that research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, by the arrival of German troops, research was interrupted.
In 1937, the design of the photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the professional press and in the following year the work of Rakiet - Torpede powietrzna and rakietobombomba lotnicza by Leliwy-Krzywoblocký came out.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) dedicated to all projects of military use of missile technology, which was coordinated by all the work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of its activity ended the start of the war.
Further work on cosmonautics appears after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish astronaut society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the Society is mentioned in the November issue of the 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, which contains four more comprehensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is designed to create a society that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronaut Federation (founded 1951) and already in the autumn, PTA has become a full member.
And in the following year, the first president of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of a very successful weather rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a range of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 flight tests of two-stage RM-2 rocket were started in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type should have been able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have reached up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, further developments were suspended in 1962.
Following the first RM rockets, the Meteor-1 rocket was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as two stages, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32,5 kg.
Three types were developed (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in size of space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, a space of 0.4 litre, a 0.34 litre Meteor-1B and a 0.62 litre Meteor-1C were available.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aerospace Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
The entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites within the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not the answer.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalised world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic formations, national economic systems, stand in permanent conflict with one another.
The cause is the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in labour prices, (major) price tensions occur.
Under that term, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the producer seeks to compete with the imports of cheap goods by "stimulating" the price of the competitor in order to attract more market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, it means for most entrepreneurs either to translate production abroad or to buy cheap goods there or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for unemployment produced by it, the social costs of the state are necessarily increasing.
The whole situation is heightened by the total reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
The reckless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where national governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are putting private capital at risk for their own population, regardless of the social downturn.
This is reflected primarily in changes to the applicable laws.
The aim is to force the economic population to adopt a private capital price dictate, especially in the area of wages.
This is happening both through a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and by limiting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty, along with an increase in the differences between the poor and the rich.
There have been public food dispensaries in Germany for many years for the poor, who cannot make a living on their own work.
The number of these people has gone into millions already.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for duly employed people to receive such wages that the state must pay them to the existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Assembly.
The austerity measures of virtually all the southern EU states certainly lead to the same situation where people are forced, under the pressure of a catastrophic social downturn, either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on hunger wages on the fringes of society, in the hope that private investment capital may eventually come into the country.
Here, however, it is necessary to ask where it will come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or African are still working for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media suggest that the State cannot participate capitally in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly insists that the State must not intervene in the economy through management intervention.
Then it must be asked whether it affects private capital, now it actually manages politics and thus the whole state in its own egotistical sense.
Here's the obvious answer, isn't it?
The evidence is the existence of virtually all-powerful and in all states the ubiquitous lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where virtually everything is reprehensible, but nothing is criminal.
In Germany, the situation is that the state ministries, due to the lack of funding, are giving draft laws to private law firms that are heavily related to industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people like that, as the Western constitutions say, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation as described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete decay and the authorities have been occupying themselves with violence.
For bribes, illegal favors, and with the help of stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were rampant without any inhibitions, and the people went to elections with a pre-sold voice" ..."character people did not apply for office at all, so once as a result of this disruption he was state eight months without consuls". "The only cure in an evil situation was self-government and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man." Appianos thought of Pompey, but he became Caesar, who changed into permanent democracy into self-government.
Conclusion As in antiquity, the current company is based on a reckless preference for its own benefit, regardless of the social interest.
By its very nature, private capital is no longer able to understand and exercise social benefits.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort to reform a deeper nature.
We must therefore seek the causality of the onset of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current situation, the demise of these systems in favour of a liberal-style democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of another round.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of deaths, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure of competition at both international and internal European level, the government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted policy-social reform, which will strengthen the state’s capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: The laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing comes from violence and never can" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, a lot of reactions have emerged, as always.
Some stand behind Israel, argue its right to self-defense, and Palestinians fall into the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli state, genocide against Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fall into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the periodically repeating waves of killing and who is the victim, after all, today's people of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
It is my intention to offer readers a view behind the curtain, a view of who the 95-year-old tension has served (counted from Balfour's Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by the available historical facts some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events of modern history.
Human history is primarily a struggle for power.
In every era, we can track down an Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it has always been these personalities, who have completely autonomously guided their steps or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a prejudicial goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands out one that could be considered the head of an octopus (if anyone is still standing above them I do not know, but I do not rule it out) - Rothschilds.
They don't say much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought in the 1990s to stop joining their name with the highly criminal acts behind which they stood and which always meant for them the consolidation of power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost every central bank in the world and against countries where central bank shares are not fighting or preparing wars (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild’s Bank of America status, began to issue his own (understanding government) money during the civil war, and was murdered in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed, he was murdered 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by the Mason of the highest, 33rd degree consecration of Albert Pike between 1859 and 1871.
The first war had the task of removing large monarchist state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial rule in particular of Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world's population somewhere to 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury are enough and do not consume so much resources), creating one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a front for such a solution) and the ultimate takeover of absolute power.
The method by which a group of richest families led by Rothschieldy works is to create a crisis and then offer solutions (order ab chaos - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the Fed, so as not to repeat crises like those created in 1907).
So after they succeeded in murdering the Habsburg heir to the throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to start World War I, they destroyed Tsarish Russia by triggering the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, militaryly and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (no longer needed a war to destroy the Tsarist Russia) and subsequently the Central European power, Austria, Hungary, was fragmented.
In order to facilitate the start of World War II, bankers allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, creating a prerequisite for radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then all they had to do was plant the German strong enough, the guilty and simple solution offering the Fuhrer and the creation of a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also played, the fifth column function, when the war fire started.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds instigated the founding of the Zionist movement, whose one branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out whether Hitler broke out of the chain on which he was initially held by international bankers, or what he did was planned to be difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created a prerequisite for accepting the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, like Germany’s war reparations, a third outbreak of war was created by the declaration of the State of Israel.
If international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, like the other, will be victims in the front line of battle, now along with the Arab or Muslim populations in the Middle East in general.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (let us take just how sharply the people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything stood the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, like ours, international bankers are putting people to choose from their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel, the Hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascism, a loyal international banker, a politician who is doing everything he can to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to grow into a global conflict and the control of Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, which travels 20% of all world oil (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a completely controlled being.
"And he compels all small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to have a brand on their right hand or forehead, so that they cannot buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of its name.
You have to understand this: who has the brains to add up the numbers of the beast.
That number marks a man, and it's a number of six hundred and sixty-six."
Film Argo: When the worst is, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students were taken hostage by the American Embassy in Tehran.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohamed Réza Pahlavi, who fled to the US after the revolution, patronizing his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would put her trust in allies in other countries at great risk.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve it.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages with force.
The prisoners of diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home has caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
The Iran debacle has contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter’s loss with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes an episode of the history that brought America small victories.
Just before the embassy took over, six employees escaped.
After the complicated peripetias, they ended up in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, while helping an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of a film crew who was in the country watching locations for science fiction movies.
Combination of genres
The plan devised by the expert on "exfiltration" Tony Mendez also required Hollywood cooperation.
To make the legend credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, and a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, a backstabbing - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
On the one hand, the documentary sequences from Tehran (in the title sequence are shown iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, light passages from Hollywood, dealt with with irony and mild exaggeration.
And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits are discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck had a remarkable career reboot.
He became a respected director and even his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
It is also the first Affleck film that does not take place in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the director's older films raised above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, reconstructing real events - the initial sequence of the embassy’s fall is impressive in its clarity, which simultaneously conveys the emotion of confusion and unimaginability that occurs when history moves out of nowhere.
Affleck and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (false crew on the Tehran bazaar).
Too many plots in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not actually offer much in the film sense of thrilling scenes.
He almost works with it successfully, sometimes he thinks something about reality - there everything doesn't go so elegantly anymore (a scene in which an impending crisis at the Tehran airport turns off a call in America and the runway chase seems far too far-fetched).
But the weakness of Arga is the distraction resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the role of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film kind of loses a dramatic move, it's a film that can be watched with mild interest, appreciate the realization and retro style evocative thrillers of the 1970s.
It's hard to tear down.
As a reminder of one living history so far, as well as proof of the exaggeration of the notions of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services, it will suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which announces an annual survey for the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We were led to this by the last event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the right organizer of the survey.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the recent European Court decision to unify premium rates for men and women.
So far, women have been favoured at life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky to insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher reported.
The controversial EU regulation includes the mandatory incorporation of bio-components into fuels, which is due to the damage to nature, and the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small quantities of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of hens' cages, which has made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
In the past, the criticism also faced a de facto ban on the use of the term spread butter or the elimination of classic light bulbs from sales.
High quality bananas are supposed to be 14 centimeters
The Union apparatus often decides under the pressure of one commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (now the Czech Republic and the threat of veto enforces the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby were also based on the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and were not to show "anomalous curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission has defended itself by harmonising the existing non-uniform national standards that have complicated trade.
Despite opposition from some states, the EU has already softened the standards on fruit and vegetables by pointing out that existing directives lead to a waste of food.
Last year's EU regulation may also be a candidate for the poll's victory, according to which the sold inflatable balloons must be required to warn that children under the age of 8 must not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has appealed to American research, according to which balloons among toys are the leading cause of death of children to suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 when blowing into fairies.
Curious ideas are born at home
There is also a relatively absurd rule concerning European officials themselves - anyone who has an official office in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must speak about FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia) instead.
In cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, the Bank Charges.com nominated a Union regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State in addition to some of the above absurdities.
The EU established the maximum levels of food stocks that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, established volumes of preserved mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a high fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies at the request of obtaining subsidies.
These ideas, however, did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument he stated that a lot of grain was born in our country and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases it was supposed to be full warehouses, which he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for the fact that the Czech Republic has moved on to the ports.
Finally, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The local development ministry managed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) offered a subsidy to the municipalities, namely to write a request for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although the regulations are easily targeted by criticism in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, the more effective functioning and development of the whole Union deserve recognition, according to a number of experts.
According to experts, the more serious problem is, for example, drawing EU subsidies on projects that have no indication of anything to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by the Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The emotion among the Czechs is that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products in Brussels, and it will not always succeed in this match.
After six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs preserved the designation of Olomouc shapes, but the Czech rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed a homemaker by our producers.
Only cane distillate products, and not sugar beet, cane distillates can be named.
In the official list of registered EU products, the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma hams have already found themselves, for example, Karlovy Vary crackers, pohořalický and Třeboň carp and žatec hops.
Pardubic gingerbread and mustard tubes can also be proud of the EU trade mark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how do you think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it works without any problems in our country, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country steal the last 20 years, the thieves running around, people's taxes and retirement age increase.
I didn't have an ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but soon you went to the Castle.
Aren't you turning your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying this whole time that I'm going to fight for the Castle as a result in the Senate elections.
I later stated that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is a tool for how I can realize my visions.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate possible.
But the problem is not only that as a nation we curse in pubs and televisions, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
To do so, the media that devalues a person and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was claimed to bribe journalists or to be a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You went into the fight for the Castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and back-to-back property returns over twenty million.
You have to change the law to do that.
But as president, you do not have that authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I lobbyed as a citizen to make the guide business a free trade, I managed to get it through.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or from the right, they deliberately reject it, and that delays citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party labeling and dogmat I can take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or a left-wing person?
From the Czech perspective, it seems to me that people place me more to the left.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by KSČM or ODS, and I will also oppose the wrong idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But you're not proving it by what you said?
When you make a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Some may call it populism, but all the suggestions I am talking about are already working in the world or have been talked about by major experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have the passwords.
And you can't keep up with that in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists, and the public to try and get them on our side to push it through.
If I were elected president, there is no problem in organizing a television broadcast where I ask the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to say why they don't want it.
When a strong personality names vices, it can be pushed to the political scene.
Take the president's direct choice, that was due to the public pressure.
To be honest, I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius, I'm not an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
I have only just begun in politics, and I will try to get majority support for my programme.
I'm trying to move things myself, if I can't, I'll be done in six years, and I'll be back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura's supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I won't do anything in one person, which is why I've been going around a lot of known people to see if they'd run for the Senate as well.
I went to Radim Jančura, who refused to do much work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorenc, who has been spreading light fuel oil scams.
I ran for a real disgruntled crowd, but now I'm in a bind.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote, and those who went mostly chose the establishment representatives.
In the Senate, we're just two independents.
People have elected the Senate so that it will be difficult to push for change.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or governors.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check every potential party's clean past, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only $20,000 in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property returns, what's yours?
I estimate private property at about 60 million.
In Prague, I have land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of artwork for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant with women and also fought against bad things and bad things.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have $60 million worth of property, and you don't have money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million to campaign.
Am I supposed to be in debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program may not be that interested.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign of my own.
The campaign costs will basically cover my senator's salary.
But I couldn't live off it, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd dampen these activities?
But it has nothing to do with the pay.
As promised, I have partially dampened my activities.
For example, my representative will be the travel agent in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I also need to live on something.
As an entrepreneur, how much were you used to take a month?
Two hundred to 400,000, which I'll take further.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You'll find the whole interview in the Saturday issue of Law.
The architects of MVRDV are proof that real adventures are not just taking place in the head - for example Spijkenisse and recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
"I find the building cheerful, it looks futuristic. Finally, there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who is walking along the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
However, I ask why we still need a library today.
They all have Internet, iPads and electronic books.
None of these old-style libraries are going to volunteer anymore, are they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate close to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which is not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This community with 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago, a decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not staggering.
And so the city councillors knew that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of madly bold bar graphs and maker of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with the usual calm and at a competition meeting in 2003 appeared with five books under his arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the committee looked around and shrugged its shoulders, the insolent Maas threw his presents at himself by size and ended his activistly justified speech with the words "Dear Town City!"
So this is my proposal for the Mount of Books in Spiikenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain was raised.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Book Mountain was awarded second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small-town grey, which so far could not offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, makes it richer by a bit of contemporary architecture.
First of all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural structure in the history of its existence.
Long way to the book
First impression: reading eldorado under the cheese hatch.
While an elevator runs through the massif of the mountain, real spatial and readerly passions can only be discovered during walking topography.
The glazed interior is bright and clear from all sides, the floor of the burnt convertible and the elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally stands shelves with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is usually incoherent and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down, and we pushed the reader's space from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is well used: offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and home technology exchange are located on Wednesday.
A special delight are the black bookshelves, which are one lining of walls, one sill and another railing of stairs.
The appearance, structure, and smell are foreign.
Even sworn architects and construction engineers shake their heads over unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse, asked Standard magazine.
So one day, in a Frisca farm, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a millimetre fleece from synthetic matter has been used as a base under the roots.
It's cheap and time efficient.
Thin textiles last one or two seasons, and then they're ready to be thrown into bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantities - was pressed on plates of four centimeters thick.
By causing heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) is colored in dark, homogeneous and loadable material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
You'll get to the top by 105 steps.
At the end of the nearly 500 meter long journey you will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the right humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite many glass surfaces, is an example project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It heats up and cools the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass hatch, the sun shines in only a short time, even in sunny days.
Wide glued wooden ligaments, which stand perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as a shade and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
He can handle the rest of the automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial sceptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to Boekenberg as "a long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: A few weeks ago, each city resident was invited to an opening to dedicate one book to his personal fund.
The optical gaps in the currently not fully equipped library, which currently accounts for 70,000 pieces, should have been filled first.
The concept worked.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This succeeded MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called the formation of identity in the technical jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he is.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting in the decision on the adoption of Palestine.
According to an expert on US-European relations, Stephen Szabo, Berlin is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first indicated that it would vote against the proposal for Palestinian observer status in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll support America's position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
NATO finally pushed it through.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, that's right.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, in the direction of the US-led policy, so to speak, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are settling in, but they are on their way to a more 'normal' foreign policy.
Foreign policy, like they have in France or the UK.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It shows the readiness to take on national interests as well as positions that are independent of the attitudes of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, namely export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other powers, and therefore Germany has to protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has a large market in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, they must be careful not to scare the public, but not even the elites in Arab countries.
Anyway, that's got to do with it.
But I wouldn't want to add too much importance to it, it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany’s relations with the US damaged when Germany abstained on both important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I think there is a great understanding of the German attitude in Europe and even in the US.
That is why I do not think that this was as dramatic a turning point as on the Libya issue.
Perhaps Germany will even earn some respect.
This indicates that it must be regarded as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the other hand, made it clear to veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of US internal policy.
I think that the Obama administration may have a considerable secretly understanding of the European position.
But, of course, as a result of the political situation there, this position cannot be held publicly.
I don't think the differences in opinion are at all as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very happy with Netanyahu's policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans to have a coherent and united European policy, which is not currently happening.
So they can't be part of a wider line, and instead they have to push things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
That's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does it even want to take the lead?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to this, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult for this country to play a larger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany adopts a larger role, anti-German sentiments arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It is actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to all the neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
The US's influence on European policy is now constantly falling, but the EU is currently not filling this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more popular - c'est la vie!

"Mark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
What is Armani Polo?
This hides a label that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection until they are sued by the real owners of the brand.
And even then, it is not clear whether they will achieve justice.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
A new case lands on my desk every week.
All it takes forgers is a few extra letters to sign their tags.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, they will have Prada-Kny registered.
German companies, such as Puma sports goods, are legally copied in this way.
Pattloch opens a binder with records of a stamp office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there. An artificial name that parasitics even in the fashion house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several storeys in which counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
But Pattloch’s cases are different, and under the authority of his handlers, he opposes the fact that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a brand that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
That means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's damaging business, we have to fight it," Pattloch calls.
"The mark dilutes, the sole position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the judicial costs of the affected industry go into millions, especially in the case of expensive example products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market.
However, the deletion of dubious records in the register of marks is difficult to achieve and costs.
Driving can extend up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch tells of cases in which the court dismissed the actions because the title claimed became a "market reality" after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's a law of the jungle.
Known cases include graphic items.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sana, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer of pumps for the concrete mixture Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue and white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The fashion goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO’s stamp office admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few employees and premises.
But last year, it was said that "the progress of the work process has returned from the emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings has fallen by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still, 81,500 complaints are still pending at the office.
It's expensive to do something against it.
As is often the case in China, they are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China is running a list of new applications worldwide for the tenth time in a row.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were selected at fees.
Simply this means that each entry costs an average of 1280 Yuan, or 160 euros.
It costs several times to start a dispute, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans have achieved that its illegal production of imitated automotive parts has been abolished.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure Chinese rights to Freudenberg.
We would forget this ourselves, because in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO stamp office also rejected the objection of the Munich company.
In the other two instances Freudenberg gained law, but the opponent continues to fight in the dispute.
You need to be very careful.
The matter is now being discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says, "Management is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be calculated. In the company’s archives they even had to inspect a hundred-year-old file to produce evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered a "high six-digit amount in euro" to the counterparty in vain in order to settle the dispute.
"From that you can see what it means to us," says Wentzler.
There is a danger that Europe will also be affected by the danger from the Far East.
And that's when the imitators secure the unprotected plates there.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to register Freudenberg for footwear and leather in Germany.
This area of business has long since been abandoned by the group, yet it has been able to avert registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch counsel German businesses to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Rather, foreigners should "anything worth protecting, registering in China in any way", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be a lot more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg succumbs in the last act of his brand drama, then it is likely that the counterparty will have to pay royalties for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed off the market in the disputed segment.
World day to fight AIDS: stomping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Congregation rehearses - and in Swaziland, orphans from parents who died of AIDS are happy about it.
The story of a connection that transcends much more than 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, there's the stomping: cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and men's moccasins look for tact on the dance floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly rise up - insist, mother and pursue each other.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it out of his textile shoes when he joins the voices with his slow, wild gestures.
It's Monday night in the music hall of the Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
It came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years old, from a researcher in human genetics to a janitor.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choir voice has a different text and even more in a very foreign language - a zulu spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self - Helping
Unaids, a United Nations AIDS-fighting program, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of which 23.5 million live in South Africa.
There are 245 000 orphans in Swaziland from parents who died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans from parents who died of AIDS, the village of Esitjeni was found by the Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second-degree school.
A patronage can be taken over for 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "narrator of stories" or "he who praises" in the language of zulu.
No one in this space can speak with a gas bantushian but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes it brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, there is an Esitjeni village in the northeast of the Swaziland Kingdom, which depends on the size of the German congregation’s voices.
Forty percent is infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in plain clay or straw huts, a large part of which are children.
More than 300 of them are no longer parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni you can see in a small, what makes the entire Swaziland sick: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male foreskin, which demonstrably reduces the risk of infection by half, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carry a virus of weakened immunity within themselves. It is not rare that they die at less than 30 years old.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, the Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without completed school education, they have no chance in a poor country.
At first it was a private deployment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed the child to go to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, a group of "Voices for Africa" was founded, which has since taken care of orphans from parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI belongs to syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
HIV, human papillomavirus, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis are common viral SPIs.
Nuts and scabs are part of the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch’s Institute assumes that at least four of the five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is spread relatively little among heterosexual adults in our country, but roughly 20 percent of newly infected HIV patients fall within this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, we often have human papillomaviruses among teenagers.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases have to be reported.
According to the Institute of Robert Koch, the number of syphilis infected was more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of newly infected HIV patients has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than a year before.
What are the symptoms of venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, difficulty in urinating, discharge, lower abdominal pain, blisters or warts.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and will therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
The risk of infection may reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because sexually transmitted diseases can also be partly transmitted by infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent rotation of sexual partners.
In case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations, and last but not least to the fees that the choir earns by singing all over Germany, some money will be collected.
"We have already sent approximately 200 000 euros to Esitjen," says the president of Annette Lennartz.
Money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini itself, a confident woman who can make it.
It also ensures that orphaned children find shelter, such as in one of their grandmothers.
Gogo, as old women are called in the language of zulu, is the support of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children arrived every day on time in uniform for school.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to Khanyisila, a lonely woman who is paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" founded a sewing school, built two hens, and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had an HIV test.
Even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King and 14 Wifes
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's quite strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his unmitigated lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state - approved way of life is responsible for the spread of HIV so rapidly in recent decades.
But so are many migrant workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, but nobody uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels once every two, three years together in the south of Africa and sings songs full of grief, combatism, confidence in the future and confidence of the blacks, which many in the southern tip of the Black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of black people - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also shed tears with many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children over whom they have patronage.
Although you can hardly find this village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than well known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," people say.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is 8,733 kilometers from here, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light shines here.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there's ice on planet Mercury.
The ice cover could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even though it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as is apparent from three studies published on Thursday by the scientific magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the area of this planet, which lies in permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters [30 cm] and perhaps even 20 meters [20 m] thick.
This water appears to have come from comets or perhaps even asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let us not put the discovery of ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the leader of scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, findings could help us to explain how water and other essential elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes, and little robots like Phoenix, undetected by earthlings, participate in the exploration of the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, small windows to endless distances.
The film comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who is circling the Sun to Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, less identifiable are pink-coloured "novores" in the birthing hall of the stars.
This area where stars are formed - scientists unromantically call it W5 - discovered Spitzer's telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at 6500 light years.
This changing heat of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The muffin ring consists of material that the star ejected during the process of dying.
In the giant Triffid nebula, which is 5400 light years away from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
A photograph of the Galactic "Cradle" was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The cluster of Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters, is visible at night to the naked eye.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors will stand out better.
The Helix nebula may look like a red eye to the observer in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years away from the Aquarius constellations.
Its similarity with the earthly continent resulted in this nebula called North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the origin of extraordinary discoloration.
This "baby" among the stars was able to dream in full beauty up to the infrared detectors of Spitzer's telescope.
Saturn and his rings: how they were created is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps these are the remains of Saturn's moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the biggest and sharpest pictures of Hubble's telescope: the vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real works of art.
The shot published by the European Southern Observatory depicts several thousand light years away a Trifid nebula in the constellation of the Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "triffidus" (divided into three parts, three bars), because the dark stripes of dust divide the glowing heart of this stellar maternity ward into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonoš, astronomers photographed the portent of cosmic collisions: 400 million light years from the Earth, the core of the two merging galaxies is lashing at each other, and a collision must inevitably occur.
This birth of the star was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical shortcuts, you can call it the nickname South Windmill.
The photograph from Hubble's Space Telescope shows a carving of the Iris nebula in the Cefea constellation.
This 1,400 light - year nebula consists of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was made up of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It depicts a black hole ring 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle of the stars gives rise to ever-new additions.
Also, these star clouds, associated with the Rosette nebula, are still giving birth to new young stars, 5,000 light years away from Earth.
In this shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was only formed shortly after the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our views of space: the most important telescopes
It was reportedly invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever larger - and the views they convey are getting deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, America, there's a Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures an average of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet its average is about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of cheap design: the telescope is secured by a hook at a height angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equal to the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Portoriko), scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - searching for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who puts his computing power at his disposal.
A view of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Very Large Telescope is standing here honoring his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should be 42 metres full and composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be expected first in 2018.
Two of Keck’s telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck’s telescopes are part of Mauna Kea Observatory, which besides them looks into space with Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea there is to be a new giant telescope with a 20-foot mirror diameter.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
The most significant impressions from space, however, are conveyed by Hubble’s space telescope.
The footage of distant worlds has been provided to us since 24 April 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets have been detected since the start of the mission.
The picture shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space in 2018 at the earliest on board the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6,5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists are based on the fact that there is ice at the South Pole of Mercury.
But there are no reliable data for that, because Messenger is circling this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that Mercury has been iced.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter daily and you will live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many will live to the Bible’s age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many will live to the Bible’s age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
We can call riding the Talysh Mountains wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles along the road with many corners along densely wooded hills, predatory rivers and plain farmhouses.
Everything's green and juicy, it almost seems we're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the final south of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of Talysh lives, which is not known for much, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and live to a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This small town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not suit the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is just a one-lane road.
The fairytale wealth for which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, Pilate Fatulajeva (48) believes that Lerik has the power to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and we will have the oldest festival in the world next year," Fatulajeva says.
She's the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented life of almost eight dozen Talysh from the surrounding area, who are over 100 years old. Fatulajeva shows black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still had a baby.
The disputed star of this museum, however, is the shepherd of sheep, Müslümov, who was allegedly 168 years old.
Of course, the birth certificate does not exist.
And since the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems extremely dubious.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulajeva explains.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he still fathered a daughter.
So was Müslümov a few decades later mistaken?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of elderly people in Central Asia.
"Admittedly, many elderly people live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "also in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, no scientific evidence of age can be provided due to the lack of evidence, especially when the registers are missing.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that people in the area of Lerik often live to the Bible age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
Why, then, do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
On the contrary, the director of Fatuljeva Museum believes that it lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread, and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem to be entirely credible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzaev.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaev, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butterscotch that she cuddles tirelessly.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzaev’s sons and daughter, both of whom are long ago grandparents.
There are two little kids jumping around.
The kitchen prepares tea for guests, which is served in typical belligerent glasses of "armad".
Mirzaev's white teeth form a perfect line and hide under the scarf long dark blond braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't look and kept my color.
"I've never used shampoo before," Mirzaeva says.
A Monthly Retirement Enough to Live
All she ever ate was what came from her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought groceries in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But everything got better when the oar was taken over by "beloved father" Geydar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that is made around the figure of the father of the nations who ruled his country as dictator knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzajeva receives a pension of 230 manats each month (approximately the same amount in euros).
And perhaps even the long gray son of Mirzaev is right: "Old people enjoy great respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, they're loved, they're cared for, and they're happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" is lacking in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Distorted demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the country’s deep disparity.
A future constitution based on Sharia law is being debated sharply.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And I am responsible for our success in front of people and God," he said on national television.
His speech was directed to the whole nation, but above all to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, still hopelessly wrangled in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "God's State" on the Nile at the mercy of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi almost apologized that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers to "save the revolution".
But what the 61 - year - old engineer, who has a doctor’s degree at the University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear.
Is the judiciary to be deprived of power?
234 paragraphs, which the 100-headed Constitutional Assembly, with the supremacy of Islamists has quickly approved in a fifteen-hour night marathon, are partly alarming.
As in earlier constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use this vague formulation and associated legal free space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least this sheds light on the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, you need to consult the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in a country with great influence on the entire Sunni Islam.
This may not be, but it may mean that the cleric will exercise oversight over lawmaking, which would result in a deficient withdrawal of justice.
There is much interpretation in the draft constitution
The problem is also that civil jurisdiction of military courts is to continue to be maintained.
These courts served under the Mubarak administration to suppress the opposition.
After the dictatorship collapsed, as many as 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As it says in the proposal, the state should also protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values".
This is legally formulated so inexactly that by means of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In clear language, this means nothing but censorship.
After all, no paragraph in writing defines the explicit equality between men and women.
Yet another paragraph forbids the reproach or slander of the prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
What remains unclear is what is defamation and how it will be prosecuted.
It is equally dubious to say that it is forbidden to "insult people".
In this case, is a cartoon of the President or a joke enough for the benefit of the law?
A matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which Morsi will submit for signature and, according to his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of popular voting.
"The revolution has returned"
For several weeks, the opposition has been forming against the outnumbered Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual concord on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it began to apply.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Prize winner and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej said that the draft constitution belongs to "the dump of history".
Through Twitter's short news service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to do a "combat against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said a member of the opposition, Jásir Said.
"We are not tired yet, our brothers' blood is not yet punished," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy of Khalid Ali.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to supervise a referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared defiance, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before the University of Cairo.
She was attended by many veiled women and salafists who cried out, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They challenged Morsi: "Clean the earth!" and they assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrir, on which it all began, would probably trigger a state similar to the civil war.
That's what Morsi's supporters clearly didn't want to risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both opposers and supporters of the draft constitution expressed themselves loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country is going.
The majority is considered certain in favour of the Islamist proposal.
"The word 'human rights' doesn't exist once"
The enforced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is aggravated by Hafiz Abu Sa'da.
Forty-eight-year-old human rights defender and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial for Mubarak.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For that he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And the words 'human rights' are not once in the new constitution," he complains in an interview for "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's extension of power to all three power forces in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President effectively cancelled it," Sa'da complains.
But democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which watches the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could come back to haunt him.
The protestor at Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster you can no longer control."
Norwegian rakfisk: The most stinking fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country's secret of success be linked to a local appetite for an extraordinarily smelly fish?
Take some overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it for a week.
That's how you get the smell paralyzing smell of rakfisk, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and there is an ubiquitous smell hanging in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in water for up to one year - depending on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians begin to meet here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, as best to say, the most captivating food.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat small cubes of fish and drink them with lots of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," says Havard.
A drink can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there was not yet a fridge, the fish were soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses no doubt dulled with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to seek work, mostly to emigrate to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by a large amount of work, high earnings and a large care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival, who was only recently much richer than Norway, flow into the country for work.
The rakfisk is seen as something important, indispensable, although rather stinking part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway often does not get into global reports - and most people seem to be comfortable with it.
The name Anders Breivik, right-wing racist extremist, who last year shot 77 men, women and children, is still mentioned here with distaste.
Instead, the shooting is called the July 22 event.
Norwegians find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind the current wealth of Norway lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We are, as they say, considerate people.
Her English, like the English of most people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don't show off, we don't like pomp.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money in this sector is invested in a special fund designed for future generations.
When all the others threw money away in the years leading up to the global financial failure, the Norwegians had tight strings on their purse.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go on trips in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of rakfisk.
I'm sure a moose burger like that is something else, and it's very juicy.
But tonight, the stinking fish is here again.
The hotel I live in is one of many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They have a connection to a live TV broadcast where the moderator is surrounded by rakfi plates.
It's like the Eurovision Singing Competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls off the chair, possibly aquavitated.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant from the BBC is looking at the challenges he faces and at the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In a city that is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers were erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a challenge.
Mexico did well economically at the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the clutches of a drug war that has already estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to reducing violence towards the Mexican people," President Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before shaking hands with the US President, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are different even in its old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural city of Valle del Bravo, they remember him well.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built. These highways are a huge improvement compared to the leaky and bumpy roads that were here before.
Plates with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, state MP for the party of President Pen Nieto, Party of the institutionalised revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in security and the economy that our country needs so badly.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
MP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations of Enriqua Pena Nieto inside the party.
And he rejects the statement of opposition characterizing the new president as a person without substantial content.
He's a very straightforward man, very interested with an excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great statesman, and most importantly, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Zahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Za, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Trapped under highway overpasses in many places, it resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called in to help cope with drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly intense.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in deserted places next to a huge garbage dump.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the better case, critics of Pena Nieto say that he failed to deal adequately with the problem of murdering women in his office.
And in the worst case, they accuse his leadership of closing their eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of the impoverished neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photographs of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like her body had been washed," Buendia recalls.
There were shock marks on it, and the postmortem rigor has already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, with one word on it: "Justice".
However, this, as the family says, is exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossiper, troublemaker, and whineer.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep your mouth shut.
"But it can't be right when so many mistakes and omissions have been made," he says.
The sash that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has promised to be his priority while he is in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," PRI Olvera says in Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Don't fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, claims the military prosecutor
The D.A.'s trying to refute Bradley Manning's claims regarding gross treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the basis of the harsh treatment of Manning in prison.
Private is charged with stealing thousands of classified documents.
The D.A. is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak in U.S. history, has missed many opportunities to complain about the rough treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor has Ashden Fein in cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had had with the officers of the unit within nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of maltreatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during the hearing on the defense's motion to dismiss the case against Manning on grounds of gross treatment at the time of custody, which is a sufficient punishment in itself, took place the day after Manning testified that he was considering suicide in custody.
An army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010, is charged with stealing thousands of classified documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, Prosecutor Fein and Manning went through the forms that the officers filled out after meeting Manning at Quantico Prison, where he was held in a high security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he regarded the treatment of his guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment of the facility as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints about maltreatment, even though Manning's officers asked directly how he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he expressed concerns about various problems orally and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not notice these problems.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about handling her person in January 2011 when he met with a committee assessing suicidal thoughts, which he expressed a few months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the mode of "prevention of injury".
The military reported that it used this restrictive regime (one degree under suicide surveillance) to protect and protect others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life I saw," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to a prison at a naval infantry base in Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and one day he fainted because of the heat.
He stated that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world has shrunk only to the base of Arifdjan, the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning reported that after arriving in Quantico he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, straps, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying was against regulations during the day.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint regarding the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manninga also asked about the charges he made on Thursday's deposition regarding the fact that, after being forced to sleep one night naked in her cell at Quantico, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates on the morning count.
Manning said he wasn't allowed to cover himself with his blanket on the count.
On Friday's interrogation, Judge Manning stated that by order of his guards, he concluded that he had a blanket to cover himself, but admitted that no one had given him an order to postpone it.
On Thursday Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that you were not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his wearers to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his socks and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into account his experience in the course of his imprisonment and that, in the event of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to begin at the beginning of next year, her sentence will be reduced significantly.
The defense has stated that it is planning that Manning will plead guilty to minor crimes and that he will fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled for this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend the detention terms as justified.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was being held in accordance with regulations regarding all arrests held in maximum security custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegal disclosure of intelligence documents on the Internet, transmission of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If he's charged on all counts, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
My Crisis of Mexican-American Identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient possibilities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely got through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Aliens").
I stood there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's an ethnic acronym, just like when my friends in Boston are called "Ira" and my friends in New York are calling themselves "Italy."
So later, I ended up calling myself "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama's White House this week.
On the agenda, they had the usual issues to discuss when the leaders of these two countries met: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
It wants to reach out to the United States and Canada and create a trading block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he didn't provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders under threat of weapons to re-write half of Mexican territory into the United States.
But for Mexicans who think over centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.
So one minute after the United States representative says something a little bit critical about Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans interfere with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will march on the warpath.
And yet Mexico’s real challenge is its relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people that the country offers opportunities to, and others that are not.
The only reason so many Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or a grandparents who had been denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person fit the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And while we live the American dream now, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
He's against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and view us as a inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is only about failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they would never have left him.
And now we would not be trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans resent it.
Even though she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many Mexican Americans I know do not feel part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have any roots in either.
In Mexico, he sees us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relations even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and press political leaders to consolidate relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And because of income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
Fair enough.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for their dealings with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel dissent for the way in which their family members were treated in a much closer history.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such happening is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary speculations about who started it, many buildings were turned into ruins, killed by more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos in the region.
It may cause their struggle to be even more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to believe that this may interrupt their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that there are currently not many reasons for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire concluded on November 21st has lasted, the battles of this week have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
Hamas’s leaders, the Islamic movement that has reigned in Gaza since 2007, will claim that they forced the Israelis to retreat, even if Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most pitiful and populous parts of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently governed by its fierce rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
The Islamists around the Arab world gained more influence, so Hamas made powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, the resurrected regional power that once was Israel’s closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The exultant people of Hamas say that the Islamic Crescent surrounds Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah is ruled, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly inclined to Islamism can depose Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt has changed, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be excluded by Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel’s hardliners will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel’s anti-missile system The Iron dome proved its worth and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the launch of the last round of violence.
More importantly, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, it has been relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that is hitting the West Bank, the main part of what may eventually be the Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that are still growing despite their illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the election campaign held on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, they wouldn't launch missiles, like their countrymen did in Gaza?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them if they stick their heads out.
Perhaps hardliners will win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel very much, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Opening a new war with the local superpower will hardly help new Arab governments heal their economies.
President Morsi working with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and may mean the start of something new.
Israelis too should look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying Palestinians the rights to self-determinate a powder keg that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Even now, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is making the situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing.
Blood attacks against Gaza every few years to push Hamas will increasingly take a diplomatic toll.
Both sides need outside incentives.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides say, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two states where Israel moves the territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping the fire will give pressure from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must work to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, has a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 border, with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside must also press for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has his share of getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first parliamentary term, he neglected the introduction of his own peace plan.
Now, back at the White House, he seems equally reluctant to enter the trial.
That's pathetically shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarette wrappers have entered into force
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, display warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australia’s laws on the ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, entered into force, and the logos and colours of brands replaced with general olive green boxes with hideous pictures of sick parts of the body and depicting children and newborns ill due to their parents’ smoking.
In addition to the various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between boxes of labels printed in the same small print is mandatory from Saturday.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by ridding them of their attraction.
They rely on studies that show that if people do not start smoking under the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start smoking.
"Even for very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them together with their product," says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that have shown, for example, that children associate a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbyed hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase black market trading, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will lead to serious unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone cigarette wrappers to cover up disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals regarding the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesale dealers and expected new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hitch, experts refer to the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan focuses.
Throughout a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes from a direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising carried out by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, the online space is the insurmountable place you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Mrs Freeman has seen an increase in the rating of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honza".
We have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and went to the trouble of making this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it deals with new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to attack new regulations - a country within the World Trade Organisation declares that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of Australia's countries are doing significant trade.
The SOO decision is expected to be passed in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has conducted talks with other governments that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering stricter laws.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
Pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and put the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photograph of a tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason for me to quit smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that single boxes make it harder for him to put them in the shelves.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, "OK, that's it, let's close the shop," he said, and he threw his hands around.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored.
The last Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I've had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and child development experts are increasingly coming up with praise for boredom.
They say that it is good for us (and our children) to be bored at times.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we have no chance of enjoying boredom.
Should we then encourage boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century C.E.
And then the question is, how do we define boredom?
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the idea to the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to."
Boring is different from apathy by not being involved in anything, but wanting to be.
He says there's no urge to do anything about apathy.
He says the core of boredom is "disrupting the process of attention associated with a bad mood and a sense of slow passing time."
Boring can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September in Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape that the person read the article on the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program silently reported more boredom than the other two groups - had difficulty concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or engaging task, the distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something boring, "like finding bad parts on the factory line, distracting music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that twisting and doodleing, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more attentive.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to wriggle will learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced boredom sometimes - the delay of my flight, the roaring speaker, especially the lengthy movie.
But some individuals have a better chance of being bored than others.
To help with the measurement of boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed the "Boredom Proneness Scale" (Bordom Proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions like: "Many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodonovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.
In 1991 Reed Larson, a professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were away from school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would now, 21 years later, be higher or lower.
But he said that he knew that "adolescents are the peak time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boredom good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling, or abuse addictive substances as a way to alleviate them.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodenovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Nude is a way of the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, watching television will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain greater self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of constant nagging of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for the need to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise turns off."
There's no manual in Colorado on the new marijuana law.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and a footballer from Southeast Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September he was riding with some friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was given a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment for use of drugs - minor offences for which there is $100 for each fine - and a court date was set for him.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr.Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on legalising small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the place rather than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana possession offences have already been lifted here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped blaming adults at the age of 21 and older for holding a small amount that will be legally permitted after the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing marijuana cases, and still accuse people of possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver are voting towards the western mountains to prevent the opening of new state-licensed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This matter is going so fast that I do not know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are scratching their heads.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licenses for cultivation, production, distribution and sales - all until 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or for worse, is ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now also recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State alcohol licensing board.
But as Mr Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent that we can follow," he said.
The Washington Act, the so-called I-502, becomes effective on 6 December, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal possession will.
And there are difficult mechanical issues that must be resolved during this time, such as how to balance the state directive on "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trafficking up to 330 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"There will be no place more difficult to place licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Centre for Legal cannabis, recently established research groups.
On November 21, police chief Oates sent his officers an e-mail informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute for possession of a small amount of marijuana for each citizen over 21 years of age and that police "with immediate effect" would stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that they would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the Weld district of North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
Currently, the accused of holding 56 grams or fewer of 119 people marijuana, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences which were criminal offences at the time they occurred," Buck said in his statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places like the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, are no longer charging adults with possession of a small amount.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but he also decided not to dismiss all ongoing possessions.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado’s voters supported measures, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have revealed a deep ambiguity among local officials in view of this great state green experiment.
For the district attorneys, it's a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendants for possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for Reforming Laws on Marijuana.
"They spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small quantities of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on their best course to become national drug legalization test cases.
Defense attorneys and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales, while waiting anxiously for instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider selling and growing marijuana federal crimes.
The defense attorneys of marijuana legalization hope that the Department of Justice will submit.
Despite several arrests by marijuana sellers for medical purposes and patients who use it, who attracted attention, the federal government mostly left the medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to break down doors to capture a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will resist allowing state-controlled recreational marijuana deals permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to President Obama's administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for the progress of the federal authorities.
Before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana business, even though it will take about a year before any trade can open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely to enter into force next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where we issue a license and then we have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the municipality voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There are really many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Today's university students are not the only ones who are attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming about studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest headquarters of knowledge, a modern wined Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
Meanwhile, in the late 1980 ’ s, within two weeks of taking up Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed up my bags, and rushed into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and wept.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard journal said I gave up because I objected to making love to students in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson exhilarated that I left because I was forced to drink from battered mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for one reason and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm bringing this up now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of students on the right side of the center suffer similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students sought equal rights protection, such as gays, disabled people, and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the younger class association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views, "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and shown not to be welcome".
They demand to establish a position in the University Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that they can freely communicate their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recently mentioned BBC Two TV documentary entitled Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about student political events, which he portrayed as weirdos and neo-Nazis.
A graduate named Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a cane with a silver head.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as "sacrifice lambs" because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday's newspaper that "leftist influence on universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
A 21-year-old student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such climate is "unpleasant", while the 19-year-old president-elect UUCA Stephanie Cherill says that the attitude of JCR members to the people on the right from Wednesday has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority about one member.
I started in September 1986, 18 years old and in a crippling way shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the most ferocious.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse the honorary title of former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in higher education funding.
Even Stalinists would tremble at the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students met with each other and with the professors, I was given a taste of the wormwood that was to come.
I found that not only do professors not only quietly approve of taunting conservative pupils, but they also enjoy participating in them.
The policy of the mining strike, privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was brought into the wooded auditoriums.
My first lecture concerned the translation of the 18th century French text into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was pretty tough.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake dough, was very biley.
"The Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you are too busy with social matters," said Professor Pitt.
I went back to my room with a broken heart.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight pat on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James who introduced himself as a member of the UCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me now, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get even worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later in the local pub, I tried cowardly to pretend.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics who (what irony) went to Eton said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students were on the phone with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
They hit each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labourer and suppress my natural tendencies?
For three years, they evolved in front of me as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of the speakers.
He almost wasn't there.
He hated that place for its provinciality and pettyness and for its tendency to Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he joined the professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he said.
I started commuting from Oxford to my parents' home in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dream moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His wet eyes got gloomy.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance worsened.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week in the course of teaching, when another professor of history in absolute seriousness declared that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I blushed inside with shame, I confessed that "parents brainwashed me" and called them "old fools".
Relief was only short-term.
My father nailed the nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I cowered inside and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
After they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snotty wimp.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and toxicity in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, though, it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers emerged, but who are also today hiding behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Fashionwork Champion", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Nate Abascalová, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous Italian designers.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabel I, England, is the only place in Britain's capital to host Valentino Garavani's exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the famous retrospective "Valentino: master fashion creation", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his respected clients.
Valentino always felt enthralled by a rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3, overflows with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Greek Princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "Bohemian elite".
There's nothing wrong with loving royal families.
"At least they won't put a pint of cigarettes in a great carpet, like some beautiful pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests entertained abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains his ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino has always preferred elegance to glory.
And he's still a star."
Valeria Mazzová performs Valentina
The designer's charisma is not forgotten by Argentina's model Valeria Mazzová.
"It has been many years since one show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome we went to his house for dinner.
There were 20 of us, and there were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every tiny detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, he reflected in everything and felt his spirit.
Everyone invited could feel important and loved by him," recalls the top model, who started working with him during the Paris Week of Top Fashion in 1995.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Nobility Parade
Gravani's life is not the story of an obsession, but a truly love-returned one.
He loves people with good manners and better degrees, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries was converted into a distinctive 70-metre-long arcade offering a role change: a visitor turns into a model and marches through a passage to observe the " generality" of dreams that Valentin's masterpieces are wearing as dresses that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that Monica Vitti wore on "Night", or a coat of wool and fur belonging to Empress Farah Diba.
In audience mannequin shines names like Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norwegian, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascalo and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentino's first love is "can't be forgotten."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vest "gillette" and jacket from the fall-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Nate Abascal, one of the designers' muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity and great love for women, because she underscores our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he uses, brightens up a lot and gives "spark" to his face.
The proportions are perfect."
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she longed to be of age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
In the end, she was in the late '90s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentino to celebrate at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with a ring on it, a crimson, and a hanger-free top.
It was a dream that came true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has saved the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not only a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in them".
"King" of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Pavel Greek in 1995.
To create these silk dresses of ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of different laces and a four-and-a-half-meter tow were needed four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses).
According to journalist Suza Menkes, the largest authority in the specialized press, this dress represents the landmark of the late 20th century top fashion, the "return of high society clients".
Valentino dazzled over the years by the elitist "savoire-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest honours in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated by the Order of the Legion of Honor accumulates as much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his splendor, calmness, groomed and perfect appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum a month ago.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was perfect, time left no trace of him."
If the princess says so...
Hardest craft in the world: sulfur carriers in Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, carriers in the area of Indonesian volcanoes gamble with their life and health as they withstand 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living extracting sulfur from Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, they have to rock to the bottom of the crater every day, where sulphur gases escape from the inside of the earth and when in contact with air, they go into a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulphur that weigh up to 70 kilos together, it carries them on its shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, but it takes over 40 minutes for the exhausted carriers to rise at a turtle’s pace to balance and carefully reconsider their steps so that they do not slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed from the Kawah Ijen rocks years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
When they are at the top, they take their way around the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and they tirelessly carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is a company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"Because it is normally carried 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip," Anto explains, who usually takes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and at the end he is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even if it appears to be a negligible amount of inhuman effort, it's three times what he would have made in the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day are paid for coffee collection, and the salary for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier who previously worked on Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as the sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risked his life three times a day in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur had already begun to take its toll on him, even though his face was protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases leaking out of the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises more than decent English.
This likable and intelligent young man of destiny could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead he does the work of a porter.
It shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur continues to rise at night and its characteristic yellow colour changes into blue and glows in darkness.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto goes into the crater and lights his way with a small lamp attached to his helmet and bought it himself with his money.
About 400 carriers are carrying on the shoulders of a basket with sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, it has not mechanised sulphur extraction because of cost savings, nor does it provide any equipment to carriers working on their own and with such efforts.
In fact, they don't even get a share of 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) of the photo supplement, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (EUR 11.2), is selected by park rangers from tourists arriving to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, and not for humans," Madrusin, a robust 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assure us that he can work "as long as possible" because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm gonna die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches the miners in dense fumes coming out of the volcano, the miners are so determined that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... but it is obvious from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulders caused by weight baskets.
At the age of 53, an unainic who balances his basket on his back can load just 50 kilos.
Each day he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which then three trucks take a steep route between the thicket to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik says, opening wide the mouth, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons he is the eldest, thirty years old, he also earns by mining sulphur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world's most difficult crafts persists from generation to generation - crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy.
The Singaporens blame the fact that they don't have children, careers, stress, and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a Menthol Candy ad, but yet - or maybe that's why - the video in Singapore has been mass distributed to YouTube at the beginning of this year.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local innuendo like "we put a bun in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency that created the video hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
The artistic director of Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people "fulfill their civic duty".
"This is strictly an Internet matter, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the country's biggest problem.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that this is the topic we need to touch.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot of things like expand perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative possible thing, like the composition of a rap, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take this too lightly is the Singapore government.
Each year, they spend $1,300 to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with respect to the stratification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate, in 1976.
Why don't the Singaporens have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and Family of the National Bureau of Population, says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of possibilities in terms of life's goals and priorities, it is not just a wedding and family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to increasing the number of single people and postponing marriage and childbearing, resulting in a reduction in birth rates in Singapore.
While there were attempts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, this has led to displeasure among the local population.
Some Singaporean websites show unhidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low salaries and little effort for integration.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons the government party of Singapore recorded its worst election result since the beginning of independence last year.
After the elections, there was an effort to address the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known implications for national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences in Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate business.
The Office for Urban Development began to regulate the number of small flats known as "boot boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had a great success in sales.
However, there is a concern that these apartments can support the bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers, claims that their "boot boxes" sell much faster than larger houses.
"They are more popular, by selling them days to weeks faster than houses with more size.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow."
However, it admits that new standards lay down clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed.
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could be aimed at increasing the birth rate of the nation, the interview with the Singaporeans working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have much effect.
"People are always stressed, houses are expensive, as well as education, which is why many people postpone it," says the young clerk.
"Let the others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women refer to careers, stress and cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force citizens to have children, they're the Singaporens who have the last word about starting a family.
What is private offline is both private and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something that has a personal character or "a private life area that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption".
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes things on the Internet that he would most certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years of age who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely of their own" on a personal level and as "user name and password" when it came to social networks.
"I wouldn't disclose my biggest secret," says ten-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I put nice pictures or pictures of us playing on FB.
I'm talking to my friends there, too.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine or a photo that would mock anyone," she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are related.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I set up a Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer, I'm just putting them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone unknown to him.
The case of José, a 14 - year - old, is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them were directing him or asking him for an address or phone number.
"If they press me or demand me, I will simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading his recommendation on Twitter.
This boy is no stranger to what is now called cyberbullying.
"A friend on the social network was blackmailed.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
According to José, the victim didn't check out of the account.
"You just activated a private regime."
Then explains a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would if someone bothered me or if I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and a graduate in the field of Education and Teaching, believes that children and adolescents need to understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform them.
He says: "The Internet was created as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, a graduate of teaching at Yale University and author of the article Digital Aboriginals and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are learning ourselves," he says.
It explains that this is a complex subject, 'because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature to do so'.
Also, to be discreet about the surroundings, at a time when what they want most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is, asking questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do anything doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the possibilities: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like someone to post your picture the way you posted your friend's?
Do you know what other people publish about you?
When you identify the persons in the photos from the celebrations, did you ask these persons for permission?
And one more: do everyone always need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to make them realize that they have to behave in the Internet environment the same way they do outside of it.
It's the same rules.
"Man is guided by respect, morality and other principles outside the Internet and should be the same on social networks," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first - degree teacher, and educational advisor explains the need for children’s parents to carefully read social networking rules.
"If they understand every insidious thing, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences they may have of setting up an account on the Internet.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers".
The South American Summit ends and the Declaration of Lima has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without the release of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and allegedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Offices, who at the beginning determined to publish the document after the summit, said that it would later be published on the Peruvian Government’s website.
They also stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in a few short press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, the video from the presidential assembly without sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "intimate meeting, sound transmission prevented".
The small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press speakers of some governments, who were present but not by the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document published during the negotiations was a list of participating presidents, which triggered the disapproval of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent out an e-mail to the media with a 'final statement' from the summit, but it is just a statement from President Humala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (America del Sur-Países Arabes, ASPA), and even on this occasion, the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, even though the press was eagerly required.
On the official ASPA website it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasts for all journalists, but they completely prevented the flow of information.
The summit ended, inter alia, with a joint commitment from Chile and Peru to the adoption of a judgment of the Hague Court which addresses the dispute over the border between the two countries.
President Peru Ollanta Humala and President Chile Sebastian Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin hearing the arguments of both parties on Monday to discuss the dispute opened by Lima against Santiago.
"We will submit and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing in this international court today," said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful dispute resolution, conventions and international courts," he added and greeted President Humal with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the decision of the International Court of Justice was published after Colombia had adopted the Bogot Pact this week, expressing its submission to the judgments of the international court that had decided on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the withdrawal of then President Fernando Lug and did not attend the meeting.
The host President of Ollanta Humala was appointed to start the morning talks and conclude the Lima summit shortly after noon.
The President read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects between South American countries had been planned, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR member countries will take 'important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which residence agreements are being extended'.
He informed that actions were supported to improve 'cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap Internet in all parts of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters'.
When Europe is in crisis, "it does not have a winning essence for economic consolidation (Latin America), but it is intended to increase our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport connections between various places in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries will be better connected and create new economic links," the Peruvian president said in the reading.
He mentioned that five of these projects concerned Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from coast to Brazil, and the other two concerned a better connection with Ecuador, but did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to bring it back to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area, which is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending a regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday, to discuss with respect the International Court of Justice’s ruling on the maritime border dispute that is being questioned by Bogota.
"It is possible that I will meet President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor will the contract with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he emphasized.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we should conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate form possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are to participate in the inauguration of President Enrique Peñi Nieta.
In the framework of the summit, EU Defence Ministers have provisionally met to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the area's defence.
The UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last country is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which 'South America, in this case, must really learn from Europe'.
Correa, who attended the sixth summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, stated on TV Perú that Europeans "killed themselves during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country".
In this sense, the project defended the creation of South American citizenship, which is supported by the member countries of Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still backward areas that want to bring us back to the past," he pointed out.
The President of Ecuador said, among other things, that he agreed to regroup the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states is reduced and those who signed the San José Human Rights Pact will be taken into account.
"Those in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is funded by the United States in Washington," he said in a reference to the political asylum provided by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles by it and respected his 'deep democratic values and human rights'.
He added that at the time "there was reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the process under way".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to submit to an interrogation in Swedish territory for alleged sexual offense, while "the Swedish legislation allows for an interview by videoconferencing that could take place from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa said that there is a risk that Assange will experience a deterioration in physical and psychological health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me he had a slight lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
"But his physical and mental state is at risk of getting worse, because he is locked in a small space without the possibility of moving in fresh air.
This would harm everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks had taken place with London in order to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate about human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is conducting a series of proceedings in various European instances," he said.
He said, "If Great Britain issues a pass tomorrow, it'll all be over."
And if Sweden hears Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or Skype, as the legislation there allows, and as has already been done in other cases, the problem will end tomorrow."
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and explained that he did not tolerate "substandardity, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The biggest enemies of the free press are not us, the wicked and perverted politicians, but the bad journalists in the service of profit, pressure and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy at the fact that neither such journalists, "not bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisies control Ecuador", and he submitted that if he was re-elected, "he would continue to change in the right direction and direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay on membership of the Union of Unasur at least until its next election, arguing that the whole 'must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and puchism wrapped in legality', because it 'destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay' democracy'.
In addition, the President of Ecuador stated that he considered it "to be entirely appropriate" to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, after the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
The sentence is not accepted at the moment.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed wide in order to be overcome and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed his hope in settling the maritime border dispute that he is dealing with in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed his view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries commit themselves to accepting judgment, however hard it may be."
In view of the possibility of running for office in the next presidential election in Ecuador to apply for a third mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility 'with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult'.
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
"I have never been interested in much, but only political power can correct such unfair situations as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I had won, it would have been my last presidential term and then I would have left politics.
If we lose, I get the same thing.
I have already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Madur, who says that President Chávez had left for scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a relapse in the state of the president," he explained.
Today, the head of the Ecuadorian state attended the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS Victims Today Is a Consequence of Late Diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a lightning had struck me," he relates in his memories to the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "relax a little", but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and began to inform himself about it with such dedication that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the most recent patients of the HIV Unit at the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), to which he came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio lives with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) since 22 years of age, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, little treatment options and a greater stigma.
At that time, the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut".
Back then, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are a lot of people who don't know about their disease and don't lose until the virus has caused the body to perish and disabled the immune system and become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS has occurred in the world, or at least since the first documented cases," says Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at Guadalajara Civil Hospital, who is a great success that the patient's life expectancy, which will begin treatment in a timely and appropriate manner, is exactly the same as that of healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at Guadalajara Civil Hospital, saying that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
An HIV/AIDS specialist and an HIV/AIDS specialist, Andrade Villanueva, explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, and that those who do not use drugs are better off: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that those who are diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, "live without problems while maintaining the treatment until the age of 75", explained the doctor in the interview.
To highlight this progress, it should be recalled that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and, in Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the UN Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS yearbook), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since AIDS was discovered, according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone 255 people died in 2011 and until this May 187. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
Why do people continue to die from illness?
- "I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens at the hospital.
The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they don't know the condition, or the late stage of the disease."
It adds convincing information: "Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection occurs. The only thing we need to do to influence the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease before, and therefore we need to offer large-scale tests to identify the disease to all those who ask for it".
In his proposal he agrees with specialists and officials from the State AIDS Prevention Council in the State of Jalisco and directly with patients such as Fabrizio, who came to get tests done in a private laboratory just because his friend did it, and despite his low age, he already developed AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi’s sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die already, I'd rather do it three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
Change was for the better, eating healthy, practicing, taking medication."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but I responsibly look out for myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who has accepted the call to share his experience with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate those who are afraid today during World AIDS Day.
"Let them run tests, let them know if they're HIV-positive as soon as possible, and if they've been diagnosed, let them realize they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message summarises the slogan of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a huge gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who is looking for information on HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are engaged in this task, "the handing out of condoms has actually increased, they used to give us one or two, today they give us hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new diseases are teenagers.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers and medical staff who want to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He suggested to change this ineffective distribution, not just behind the counters, but the 100 in the dispensers in the public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It is not support for promiscuity.
It's not even about "paying them a beer and a motel", as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already have sex life," he said.
Key numbers in the State of Jalisco
13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV) have been reported.
This condition means fourth in Mexico in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13 in connection with HIV.
92% of infections occur sexually, 6% of blood through y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are four to five people who do not know about the disease for one registered case.
The judgment approved by the US Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the debt restructuring of Grupo Vitro set by the bankruptcy in Mexico, raises an unfortunate precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, the procedures for restructuring companies that allow Mexican laws do not seem to apply in the land of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
Last June 15th, Judge Harlin Hale's approval of the verdict at the North Texas bankruptcy court leaves Mexican firms without defense in practice against the possibility of confiscating their assets on the other side of the river El Bravo.
However, the verdict opens the door to the United States Supreme Court of Mexico’s main glass manufacturer, appealing against three irregularities.
First of all, while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the United States insolvency law, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure provides for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, this would point to the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of the insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In fact, the United Nations model law for unification of international trade law, which determines the American Law Institute by arbiter, was created for this purpose.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote of branches from the internal corporate structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro vis-à-vis the branches is recognised, the majority requested to approve the restructuring would not be reached.
However, Mexican laws allow this possibility.
The fact is that Vitro was not the first to accept this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for whose in-house debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
Moreover, it is true that even after deduction of the votes of the branches, creditors - who opposed Vitro in a court in the United States, i.e. "supposers" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach a majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
That information shall not be taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the background of the serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family company González Sady will appeal to the appeal court for a new assessment to take place with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because initially only three voted.
If it fails here, it will demand, as an appeal, a revision of the process by higher instances, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The case is serious that the court has omitted the document sent by the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae unit, in which Vitro’s procedure under the Competition Act is described in detail and points out that the company has eased itself by resorting to agreements signed by the two countries to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
Moreover, it points out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, which is the rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall assessment
A few months of criminal charges against the former owner of Gastón Azcarrag Andrade, who was accused of fraudulent activity, were ignored, and according to the pilot’s union, the vessel had already overflowed.
An instance led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstruction in justice.
In its view, the Authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on the transaction by the latter, in which it selected 198 million pesos from Bank IXE of Fideikomis F/589 on behalf of Mexican aviation.
The funds were probably directed towards the purchase of shares of Professional Hotel Management (Administradora Professional de Hoteles).
As is known, Azcarraga Andrade is the majority shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mart
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of the association met at the Universidad de Caribe this weekend to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kankún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge trading and distribution centre with big-walled products focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area for 150 employees at the bottom.
Previously, the Canacintra organization (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has managed to unite the governors of the southeast zone to oppose a monumental area that would partially devastate the protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of ACTA document matter
The Senate's request, which was not taken into account by the government, requesting an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Agreement in Japan, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial) has lost its status.
As is known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of treating it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect those short-term ones, the developer Homex places investment certificates for 500 million pesos on the market.
This series is the first of four identical ones offering interest payments every 28 days.
Competival is born
The merger of leading IT companies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet was the birth of a trade name Competival, the aim of which will be the software services market in Central and South America.
Investing in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: " Basketball was my life"
Basketball World Circular Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has travelled the whole world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was enthusiastic about this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, a BSN national basketball league player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the National Basketball League, or president of the Puerto Rican basketball Federation.
"I have played a lot of roles in basketball during my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, CEO of the national team and president of the Federation," Reyes recalled when visiting reporters of Primer Hora in his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel for more than 50 years, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the greatest emotion of all, he guards those who resemble his work in Los Vaqueros from the mid-'50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
"That was my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to take part in eight championships with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
At that time, the team was taken over by "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here and at that time worked at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a six-footer for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended me to quarterback Raymond Gauss, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brought Bayamona a victory in the championship, Gauss would contribute to the next."
He enjoyed the championship where he played Gauss for the team, but only remotely, because in 1988 he had already served as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy's position on the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in a qualifier's Olympic game in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended up in the quarter, but we should have been bronzed had it not been for the Canadian referee who had us repeat the final handball," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold, and we beat out a United States team that was pretty similar to the one that blew out the bronze at the World Cup.
This team had not only Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fica López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, León brothers (Frankisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been on the team in 1990 due to knee injuries.
The team, who may not have had the perfect composition, but managed to win us a gold medal and bring us great joy, was the Olympic qualification team in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With the players on the roster, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players voted out because of the fight in the Pan-American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his involvement in various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arilla very much.
Which success in the Federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national BSN league had up to 17 teams in one season.
What didn't you have time to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like dividing youth categories by regions.
For example, that the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
I'm glad.
What do you do now?
I listen to music the most, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman Died
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, world-famous starring role of John Ross Ewing, more known as "J.R." in a Dallas television series in which he embodied a man who acted ruthlessly and was vicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil mogul J.R. Ewing in the Dallas TV series became a symbol of greed in the '80s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died according to the official announcement of the family provided to the Associated Press by the production company Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon for cancer related complications.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was a representative of his wife in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in the Dallas hospital," said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," said Linda Gray in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted to drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and Hagman submitted to a transplant.
Years before the Dallas show, Hagman became famous on TV as a decent guy in the lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets an attractive girl (Jinnah), who Barbara Eden plays, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies, which were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72), and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in the movies included roles that were well accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was up to Hangman's masterpiece in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the star top.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot Djeyar?", which was supposed to trigger expectations about a work full of emotion, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge series of spectators around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in bookmakers.
This has also helped this episode to achieve a record in ratings.
In an average of 41 million television viewers, Dallas became the second most watched entertainment show in history after the end of the MASH series in 1983, which watched 50 million viewers.
His sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) fired at J.R.
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and then he threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy greedy man with a charismatic smile: a crafty businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to put his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) who was an alcoholic in rehab.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorary citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"The shooting of five parts of the second row has already been completed and the sixth one has just been filmed," the TV station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the show would proceed.
Fort Worth native in Texas was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classical works such as South Pacific musicals and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950 ’ s, Larry tried his luck on theatre scenes in New York and then served in England in the Air Force between 1952 and 1956.
There he met young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he published an autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolute True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or harm anyone," he told Prensa Associada.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped timid patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet them when they have surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy".
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starting a course that explores the "end of the world"
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When Professor Stuart Charmé decided to take an end-of-the-world course this semester, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: The end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar, which was due to come on December 21st, caught many people as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was ahead of him in the next few months: Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a budget gap that some call 'the debt Armageddon', and the growing conflict into which Israel is drawn, a place in which, according to Christians theorizing about the end of the world, the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When one discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it's a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for the apocalyptic-minded.
And that's not the only professor who's offering "end of the world" courses this semester, which is theoretically the last one in history.
At Temple University, the assistant professor Barry Vacker holds a course called "Measures, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We are discussing why these ideas are expanding with time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students are analyzing films with apocalyptic themes and researching how different they are from examples of real life.
"I tried to inform students of what is possible, probable, believable and impossible," says Vacker.
Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an expert assistant in art history and anthropology, joined the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania to organize a course called the End of the World.
"We do not add "2012" because we always count on the possibility of organizing the course again in case the world does not end," said Restall.
Despite "threatful destruction", students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until just the evening of the anticipated end of the world", said Restall.
Courses have become quite popular.
"He spread out within two hours," said Restall about his high-average student course, which he applied for 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we were asked by e-mail if there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
So apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is simply a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of an hour in which this could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confessional student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the end date of December 21st.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan predictions and in some way we refute it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple University of West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that dates back several centuries, which people respond to changes in their surroundings by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused these speculations to flourish.
"Other people don't think about it," he said.
This is happening in the vast majority of the English - speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at La Salle University, who is lecturing in the Philippines this year, answered quickly about a course on the end of the world.
"Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote and indicated an exception to the Supreme Authority.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there were many days of the final judgment, and he said that if nothing happened on December 21st, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world would end.
The date is taken lightly by both students and professors.
Several have said that they intend to go to the "end of the world" festival.
"I'll probably call some friends to laugh together," explained a 20-year-old communication student named Samira Ford.
