Novak helped Trabzonsporu to the second place, he also hit Škoda
The defenseman Filip Novák helped with a goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonsporu to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2:1 on the Kayserispora field and kept the third Besiktas behind.
After the January transfer from Slavia, the attacker Milan Škoda gave the tenth goal for Rigespor, which he saved, even though he succumbed 1:3 on the field of Fenerbahce.
Novak confirmed excellent productivity on the defenseman with a seventh goal in this league year.
In 63. minute goalie Kayserisporo just fired a rough shot and the Czech footballer from the angle hit the ball into the net.
The landlords managed to settle five minutes before the end, but the Trabzonspora in the sixth minute setting pulled the win to its side when successfully finished the four-on-one breaker.
The damage at the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce leveled after a solo to 1:1.
The riskor did not last long, but he did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of his opponents he remained three points above the descent zone.
The competition will conclude with Sunday's duel of the master Basaksehir on the Kasimpas field.
The well-classified cave at the hermit's in the woods near Nový Bor wasn't really habitable.
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lužické Mountains, near Nový Bor, Českolipsko, in the forests by which the Count's Way led, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Natural and artificial.
And we will follow the human hand created.
The place is called the Hermit Cave.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here and the caves served as a shelter, more precisely a hiding chamber apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into the rocky ostrich and accessible up the stairs.
But you can hardly see it until the last minute.
It will be revealed up to narrow steps leading to a rock gallery from which it is entering the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be far from human dwellings, at the time of its creation there may have been a field on the plateau, where there is today a forest.
"The fact that the building has no window and not even in the traditional location of the heating site clearly shows that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podružek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-space object has only a stone bench in the back, which apparently serves to put the containers away.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podružek.
There's evidence of instruments on the cave walls.
Breaking sandstone with a pointer was quite easy and fast for the insiders.
It was enough to make good use of the claws and gradually break the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the trail and the method of cutting, it is possible to determine the period of creation of the cave.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the disorder that occurs in it, there are sometimes sleepovers there.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest paths and you are caught under a flowing stream cave and not far from the count's path, you will surely find the trail down too.
And on the way out of the woods, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minařík is after a hard fall in Germany in artificial sleep
"Philip is in the best hands right now.
The Institute is set up for similar cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This greatly eases my situation and also the care of Finja's daughter," the server Jedřici.cz quoted the statement by Minařík's wife Katji.
"Everybody's doing their best, now Philip needs time to recover.
There's no point in giving any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation may change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We must all be patient now and give him time," said the wife of a 45-year-old jockey.
To the financial support of the injured Minarik, star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh race in Ascot, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, tied up Lester Piggott's legend.
Almost 70,000 euros were collected on the Gofundme server today.
The target is EUR 100 000 (CZK 2.6 million).
Videojudge took the footballers Sassuola four goals, lost 0:2
Although Sassuola’s football players got four balls into the opponent’s goal in Saturday’s game in Naples, they eventually had to accept defeat 0:2.
Neither of their goals referee after consulting the video because of offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record of affluence with technology, the VAR has never thwarted one team before.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than road radar and punished him like no team has ever been.
New technology breaks records," Gazzetta dello Sport commented.
"Sassuola's unrecognizable goal festival.
VAR has never been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead on Saturday at 8 minutes, but after half an hour of the game it seemed that Sassuolo had settled.
The goal of Filip Djuričič was not recognized after the videojudge was hit because of the offside.
For the same reason, Djuričich’s other interventions and hits of Francesco Caputa and Domenico Berardi did not pay.
On the other hand, the landlord added one more goal.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
The most recharged in the Czech Republic in history
"The growth was driven by a 30 % increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging on public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said ČEZ's head of clean technology Tomáš Chmelík.
Other big players such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla electric car manufacturers, as well as Bill and Lidl supermarkets, report their part on the market.
The operator of conventional petrol stations is represented by MOL.
She doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We only started building our network for electromobility last year," Jana Jusková explained.
However, Deník's editor exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
They indicate that drivers took an average of 13,5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of about a hundred kilometers of smaller electric car.
Apart from small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of the refuelling was then carried out in a free tariff.
If motorists had already paid for the purchase, their typical spending was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility runs mainly in the capital city.
On the territory of Prague are located all five of the busiest chargers of ČEZ, which will be overshadowed by its popularity even entire regional cities.
Olomouc leads between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border region, such as Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unusable throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
This first semester alone added 1274 new e-cars.
In an extensive poll by the Journal of "Czech on the Move", eight percent of readers said that they are considering buying an electric car into the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their vicinity.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to organizers, the government's actions to date on the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the resolution of the climate crisis are insufficient, and speakers have called for a stronger approach.
The last drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Movement of the Rainbow, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people who have long been opposed to the Turów mine expansion, there are people who are opposed to the gravel mining near Uherský Ostroh, there are people who are opposed to the construction of meaningless dams," Marika Volfová said.
It stated that the main requirements of the protesters were to create a plan for water retention in the landscape, a rapid change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies to promote sustainable agriculture, and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend people's interests, not reckless and devastating business," she said.
On Malostranské náměstí there was a stand with a petition calling on representatives of the Czech state to promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of Czech land and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of Rape Depsies" or "Less of Coal, More Minks".
From South Moravia to Prague Jan Škoda came from the Za voda for people who protested against the plan of mining gravel sand in Hodonínsk.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140 000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most powerful source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned production of gravel is located only about 500 meters from the wells and according to the reports it is certain that the quality of the water will be compromised.
For so-called agroecological farmers came from Valeč village in Karlovy Vary Vojtěch Veselý.
He pointed out the pros of small farms that do not marry for yields and profits and supply the inhabitants on site.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population perfectly, they will not do so much damage to the form of rural and environment," he said.
Three people died in a plane crash on a house in Germany
Three people died today when an ultralight plane crashed into an apartment building in West Germany and two others were injured.
Local emergency services reported this, according to which there are probably two members of the crew and one resident of the house among the dead.
The aircraft crashed to the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of five apartment units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Deputy Chief of Local Fire Department Robert Meyboom has reported that both members of the aircraft's crew have probably died.
According to the police, the third victim is a woman who lived in the house.
With reference to Mayor Wesel, Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) wrote that she was a single mother whose two - year - old daughter was rescued from her apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a landing brake.
The police assume it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The machine started from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
With reference to eyewitnesses, the Rheinische Post reported that before the crash, the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, referring to other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft had disintegrated in the air before the impact on the ground.
Česká spořitelna incorrectly charged some credit card payments twice on Saturday.
The error has already been removed
On Saturday afternoon, Česká spořitelna incorrectly charged some credit card payments twice.
According to spokesperson Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have been related to thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already removed the error and returned the money to the clients.
The savings bank recorded problems with double billing of card payments on Saturday afternoon.
"Last night (Saturday) we updated the system and immediately returned all these double payments to clients.
At the moment, everything is working smoothly," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank has deducted the money from card payments twice is unknown to the bank’s spokesman, according to his estimate, were smaller thousands of transactions.
The reasons for the problems are being identified by the savings bank.
"It could have been a combination of multiple factors," said Kropík.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojtěch will present a three-degree system against coronavirus on Monday.
"The levels will be according to the power of community spread at regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch said in ČT.
It will be a so-called light, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red depending on the risk of coronavirus.
The Minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian Region would currently have orange colour and Prague would be near it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional sanitary stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at regional level because the situation is not uniform in them," Vojtěch said.
Waterman and Carolina
When the waterman Jonah and the miller's daughter Karolínka fall in love with each other, it's not easy at all.
Jonah's father, the impertinent waterman Hastrbuch, has no idea that her dear Jonah is not a man.
It's a good thing there's a young man named Libor who's gonna do everything he can to protect the village, especially Caroline, from that water villain.
What does it matter if he plots and lies?
Especially if she can get Caroline to reject Jonah and prefer him, the valiant Libor.
Soon it will be clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for drowning the midnight pot, the rotten flour, the mill fire and other scoundrels.
The angry villagers are setting up a waterman hunt, and an implacable waterman’s curse will fall on Jonah’s head.
Now, Pottle's soul, Caroline!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and deliver him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the Czech TV studios and in the exteriors near the Brzina pond, in Obděnice in Sedlčany and in the beautiful surroundings of the historical mill in Hoslovice.

The course of the majority disease is mild, only 3% of the patients have to go to the hospital
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or our summer dose of sunshine has greatly improved our immunity.
Hospital infectious wards are half empty, even if the numbers of the infected are growing.
"The situation is quite different today and in April and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," says Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11th, when the first wave of epidemics peaked in our country, all of them wore masks, the military carried out samples, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year in advance.
Yet ten people died a day.
Now, the daily increases in the number of infected people are higher, but every day, with covid-19, at most two people die.
The highest number of people infected still has Karvinsko, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer's centre, where there are 57 already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by hygienists in Černožice in Kralovehradeck.
The disease confirmed the tests at one of the nurses.
"We travel, we restrict movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says Martin Schhnal, director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the home clients have ever had symptoms of a disease.
The hygienists will start the field testing tomorrow, and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are responding to an increased number of infections.
The Oncological Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people wear a mask when entering.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists who have recorded 25 cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of a money company.
Overall, there were 131 infected - i.e. half of Friday's number - but less tested at the weekend.
A debutante champion!
Van den Bergh finished his story, took Anderson out.
The big surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh has performed an excellent performance even in a duel with the player who won the second most prestigious enterprise within the PDC in 2018.
The introduction of the match was mutually balanced, the break came in a state of 8:7 for the Belgian darter.
Van den Bergh took a breaker with a 13-arrow leg, and he's had the upper hand ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game, and a much more experienced "Flying Scotsman" was hardly able to get to the doubles.
The way "Creator of Dreams" had him in his pocket is also evidenced by the fact that the upset Anderson played his first best in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian mastered the excellently high checkouts.
Last time he lost in the 11th leg, in an unfavorable condition, but "catched a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson was very frustrated.
The darts were more of a throwaway, and his triumph-walking opponent was acting completely sovereignly.
Van den Bergh turned the first of three match gifts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
Profit of trophies named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable to the Belgian darter that it is his first winning major.
It continues that Karel Sedláček is the last player who managed to beat Van den Bergh.
Nantes was charged with a cathedral fire, a man confessed
The Cathedral of Saint Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
Suspects of arson were investigated by investigators because the fire progressed through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police found no sign of anyone entering the cathedral by force.
The defendant is a volunteer at the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without starting a prosecution.
Now the D.A. has reported that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed, and is facing arson charges.
If he is found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a fine.
According to his attorney, the man regrets the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present a "semaphore" for epidemiological measures
The new system is supposed to play the role of a pandemic plan that the government and the Ministry of Health are facing criticism because of its absence.
"The levels will be according to the power of community dissemination," the minister explained.
He added that nowadays, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach the middle, orange stage.
The system is designed as a regional one because the situation in each region differs significantly, added.
The Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be established at individual levels, whether they involve the obligation to wear masks or the organisation of special departments in hospitals.
The Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the establishment of an epidemiological plan on the TV program Prima Partie, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation deteriorates.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized patients remains low.
Vojtěch commented on this by the fact that nothing essential is happening it is not appropriate to talk about the announcement of an emergency or the re-embarkation of the crisis crew.
In view of the growing number of infected persons since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear masks at internal events of over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now totaling 1000 people.
The government's procedure, when until the last moment it was not clear what measures would apply and when they would be announced, was criticized.
"I think that, in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of certainty and straighten the confusion," said Senator Marek Hilšer in Question.
The measures can now vary according to the region, for example in Prague from Sunday onwards, the obligation to wear masks also applies in non-residential medical facilities, e.g. in pharmacies or waiting rooms with a doctor.
The obligation to wear masks during the visit of health and social facilities or pharmacies was introduced from Friday also in the Liberec and Ústí Region.
In the Highlands of Jihlava it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public areas, in public transport and in medical facilities since 14 July.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures were released in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as in the Central Bohemia Region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech Government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which distinguishes the level of disease risk in individual European countries in colour, and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In countries with low and medium risk, authorities have not required Czech citizens to test negative for coronavirus or order quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when the Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in a low-risk category.
Technoparty in Benešovka continues.
Plays on a third capacity, she was supposed to quit at noon
Hlaváček ́s Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty at Hlaváček ́s Lhota in Benešovka continues on Sunday evening.
Still playing a third of the original 12 musical systems.
According to the evening estimates of the police there remain about 500 people after 20:00, the original gross estimates talked about 300, in the morning there were 900, said police spokesperson Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end on Sunday at noon, at which time a part of the music systems actually died down.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
Music production is still partly ongoing.
We expect that the music systems will gradually be disconnected and dismantled," Nováková said.
"The police are still scrutinizing leaving visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breathing test before leaving," she added.
There are dozens of police officers overseeing the operation, there are foreign police, traffic and order police, and there are also dog handlers on the alert.
"During today's day, the police checked 470 people moving at the venue of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breathing test, six of which sat behind the steering wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for the presence of narcotics and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
The police also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the technoparty participants, police performed 300 preventive breathing tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants hadn't decreased, the police would have intervened.
Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said this on the TV program Prima Partie.
However, the number of participants decreased below 1000, so the police evaluated that intervention was not needed, nor was it requested by the health department or the Ministry of Health.
Czech Television (CT) stated on Sunday that technoparty was extended to the surrounding land, whose owners disagreed with the use of technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim compensation.
Techno fans in the meadow at Hlaváček's Lhota arrived on Friday night.
The police originally patrolled the meadow in Blazimi in Benešovka on Friday, where the technoparty took place last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváček's Lhota, where the technicians actually got together.
According to Novak, no one came to Blazimi.
A viper's bite: the little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case of this year was recorded in Železnorudsk.
The viper bit a girl in the leg there, the year 2010, who was brought by her parents to the rescue service base there," the regional spokesperson for the medical rescue service Mária Svobodová told Deník, adding that the child was transferred to the hospital in Klatovy after that.
The viper is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and these animals occur in higher numbers in Šumava, so it is good to be careful when walking.
But there is no great danger from these animals.
The chances of being bitten by a viper aren't too high, she's afraid of herself in normal contact.
And if she has space, she likes to crawl away for a loud hissing.
They only attack if they feel very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
But even its bite is not a tragedy, its poison is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from an allergy.
Therefore, the risk is particularly high in children, elderly and allergy sufferers.
"A person often has a feeling of vomiting after being bitten, sweats, fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, weakened individuals and especially allergies may experience an anaphylactic shock," Miriam Gredová of Klatovy Hospital described for Diník.
The man threatened to throw the babies out the window.
He was pouring wine and throwing dishes at the police officer.
After 11:00 p.m., a task force broke into the apartment and detained the men.
Infants were immediately taken into care by health care professionals, said in the press release spokesperson Markéta Janovská.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, he threw dishes, knives, or poured wine from the window after the police negotiator.
He strengthened his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out the window with the child in his arms.
One day he even climbed onto the windowsill, where he was staggering.
The police are still investigating the man.
He doesn't want to publish any more information yet.
Stosurová prefers her daughter over the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not interfere with the coronavirus affected by the season this year.
Thirty-six-year-old US Open 2011 champion who became a mother in June, but doesn't want to end her career yet.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to Genevieve's daughter in mid-June.
"I will stay home, spend time with my family, be with all the little milestones that our Evie will experience in the next six months, and I will just enjoy it," said the former world leader in doubles on the Australian Union website.
The WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season on August 3rd with an ancient tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Razia revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, moreover under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be destroyed in the rendering plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
The inspection of the live fish stand then revealed that the seller did not have proof of origin and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary point of view in the long term.
For example, last autumn, vets discovered an illegal grocery store, with almost half a ton of unmarked foods without proof of origin.
Most of them couldn't figure out the date of consumption, some of the products had a expired shelf life and were corrupted.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the durability date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians with police officers on the market arrested 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, part of which was moldy.
Putin telephoned the Greens before the Donbas ceasefire began, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenský about the situation in Donbas, where a new ceasefire is due to begin from midnight.
According to the Kremlin’s statement, Putin criticized, among other things, the Ukrainian Parliament’s decision to hold local elections; Kiev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
New ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by negotiators of Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The truce is to begin after midnight at night on Monday, it is to be "complete and universal" and it is to open the way for the fulfilment of other provisions of peace agreements.
In an interview with Zelenski, Putin said that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk Peace Agreement and threatens the prospect of settling the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the upcoming elections to local councils would not take place in the territory dominated by the pro-Russian insurgents.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after giving these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections.
According to Unian, the Green Office said that both statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbas, as well as the need to implement further measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining areas of fighting or withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, in the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement helped to stop fighting, but in occasional shootouts and artillery attacks, people continue to die on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 deaths since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made the end of the war in Donbas his priority, but there has not yet been a more fundamental breakthrough in the negotiations.
The unexpected master of the decathlon is Rykl, the seven-fight was dominated by Novotná
The defense attorney of the last two titles Doležal did not reach the end of Saturday's program 400th, Kopecký did not jump the base in the pole on Sunday.
For a long time, a Latvian representative of Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in a group of coach Josef Karas, ruled by the detachment, but resigned after the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor MČR so far, this time he was the only decathlon player who got over the 7,000th border.
Another medals were awarded to Vilém Stříský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl reminded the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's a shame the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start, because that would make the results look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, and I appreciate the fact that I took a 30-centimetre personal store in the distance.
Then I was pleased with the stick and most disappointed with probably the disc, there I was below average," he admitted on Union Facebook.
Katerina Cachová won the first day of the seven-gauge with more than a hundred-point advantage, even though she was tormented by an injured ankle on a rebound leg.
In the remote sector, however, she then registered only 570 cm, did not switch 40 meters with the spear and did not enter the final eight hundred.
Novotná gained 5878 points and won by 241 points in front of Kateřina Dvořáková.
It came mainly from a distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630.
Yesterday my calf started pulling, but I'm really glad I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotná said on Union Facebook.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per mile.
Like petrol and diesel, it has its ecologically friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is quite new - the European market first appeared two years ago and according to the press release of the Czech LPG Association arrived several days ago.
"These days we received the first 15 tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed in a mixture with conventional fossil LPG to our petrol stations," says Jiří Karlík of Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be considered bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, chemical is identical to conventional oil LPG, which many motorists are fueling into their cars now.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
"The only difference compared to classical LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, Chairman of the Association, about bio LPG.
This also refers to one of the great advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and also the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food and cane residues.
In the future, it should also be produced specifically, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
By contrast, conventional oil LPG is partly produced as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly by separation in the extraction of natural gas.
Consequently, depending on the production technology and the source of the vehicle's bio LPG operation, 40-70% more environmentally friendly from the point of view of the carbon footprint than the oil LPG operation and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not the CO2 emissions from the car exhaust, but the ecology of the fuel production, i.e. the so-called "well-to-tank" part (Czech for "source to tank").
One of the largest producers of bio LPG are the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP ČM), Unipetrol also explores the possibility of production in its Litvínov refinery.
According to estimates by the Association in the Czech Republic, about 170 000 vehicles are running on LPG; the Ministry of the Environment lists a slightly higher number in NAP ČM, approximately 200 000.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 LPG-powered cars were rebuilt only last year.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at approximately 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch reviewed the number of infected, number dropped by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers of coronavirus infected.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
On Sunday afternoon, the number dropped from Saturday 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 fewer infected.
There are currently 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"After the jump increase in the number of cured people, there is a revision of data, which the health care professionals have been unable to update recently," said the head of health statistics Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were infected with coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11 419 healed and 371 diseases of Covid-19 unfortunately succumbed.
Mobile Election Units or Correspondence Choice.
Politologist and sociologist were looking for options for the time of pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), the amendment of the law is needed in order for people in quarantine to be able to vote in October's regional and Senate elections because of the coronavirus.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He said it on Sunday at the Prima Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of the parliamentary parties at the Ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change to the electoral law," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find solutions within the legal rules in force.
However, the Minister said that it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law according to which people in quarantine cannot vote because of their health.
The prohibition to vote should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated in OVM that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
The current bill, which is in the Chamber, then counts on its introduction for a vote abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
Prokop also considers the concerns of YES or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather record it to other types of parties) from the correspondence election to be overestimated.
Personally, it is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (choices) that could be implemented this year and with the least possible health risk.
He considers it the main course to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence option (whether abroad or in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
As another, he sees the electoral units already mentioned or, for example, the possibility of a proxy vote within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of coronavirus - were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Various types of elections in 67 countries have already been postponed this year due to the spread of coronavirus disease.
Protests in Buharsk: Pig ears threw protestors at the government building
The participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
This was another of a series of protests against the "mafionic style of governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a national blockade on Wednesday, reported by DPA.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th day in a row, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom, had a weaker turnout than the previous one.
Around 300 people gathered at 20:00, some streets had to be closed for transportation.
The demonstrators in front of the government staged a theatre scene in which they symbolically locked Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Gesev into the prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers of President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both of them is one of the fundamental demands of the protestors.
They also demanded the abolition of the announced reform of health care and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests Nikolai Hadžigenov said today on public radio that on Wednesday there is going to be a "top escalation" in the form of "national demonstrations in Sofia and blockades throughout the country".
He repeated the demand for the resignation of Boris and his government, as well as the announcement of early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov said earlier that he was not going to resign.
It was justified, among other things, by the need to implement the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he switched five members of his government team, even though the concessions did not calm the demonstrators.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov’s government survived the parliamentary vote on trust in Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovič no longer wants games without the audience
The football coach Boloni Siniša Mihajlovič has had enough Italian League games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that since the new season fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're doing here right now is not football.
I'm sick and tired of games without spectators.
It's sex-free football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, it doesn't bring me any joy.
Those fights are worse than training.
It's terrible to play like this and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks so," said Mihajlovich before today's game against Lecce.
The Coronavirus break is followed by series A matches in quick succession, and although they are played in the evening, their players are exposed to heat.
"We play in terrible heat every three days.
Under such conditions, you can't tell how the teams are.
I wish this season was over.
Those measures had to be taken in order to finish the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back from September," said the coach, who had also led Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
This season is also extraordinary for Mihalovič because four months on the bench were missing due to leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and everything else, our team has managed to move the level up.
We want to continue to grow and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of the cyberattack of foreign states, claims Iran
Fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial, and nuclear facilities since late June, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories, and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have reported that the fire that erupted this month in the underground nuclear operation in Natanz could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, Abbas, has told journalists according to Iranian media that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks" every day.
He added that it is not a new phenomenon and that most of them can be reflected.
In recent months, according to Musavi, several broader cyber attacks have been recorded, which have been the basis of "specific governments and groups" according to analyses.
However, according to Reuters, he did not disclose any more details about the possible perpetrators.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries, and other places are common in summer.
This month, an article by Iran’s IRNA state agency discussed the possibility that Iran’s enemies, such as Israel and the US, might have been behind recent incidents.
However, none of these countries were directly accused of the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term tensions between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington resigned from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and imposed sanctions against Iran that have a hard impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Kasem Solejmani and a member of the leadership of Iraqi militia Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3rd.
On January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq, where Americans operate.
The U.S. admits from a distance that dozens of U.S. soldiers have been injured.
Israel considers Iran its archenemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended production shutdown, now until 25 May
The Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has renewed production shutdown due to coronavirus.
Production lines should be restarted on Monday 25 May morning.
The start will be accompanied by dozens of sanitary measures, said the spokesman of the car manufacturer Tomáš Paroubek.
Production has been due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of 18 March.
Originally, the company intended to restore it on Monday 18 May.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the outage is closed borders and closed dealership, so cars have no one to sell.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. two shifts.
Coronavir is affected by key markets of the company, such as Italy, the United Kingdom, or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Cologne) said that the outage of production in TPCA is not signed on to life in the city.
"It was obvious from the beginning, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when things got really loose.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed at the hostels.
"In those two months we had almost no problem to solve," Kaspar said.
For example, Mladá Boleslavská Škoda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, restored it on Monday 27 April in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither of the races works at 100 percent capacity.
The renewal of production in the Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 sanitary measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, a third, i.e. night shift, took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the production was renewed.
There are currently around 2500 people working in TPCA and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time the employer in Cologne.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to the family
For more than two years, she'd been struggling with the vicious cancer of Gemma Sisson, and when it seemed like she'd beat cancer, the disease came back.
A 35 - year - old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a hospice bed, where she could still marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, the disease has succumbed.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook social network account for the loved ones.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and her boyfriend Ricky Moore, who had lived with for more than 16 years, traveled around the world in competitions.
Thirty - nine - year - old woman sports and lives healthy, yet in April 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma started an exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, hoping to recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma really seemed to have succeeded in winning cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
According to the British daily Daily Mirror, the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour spinal surgery and then resumed drastic treatment.
Of course, everything was in vain.
Early this year, on her 39th birthday, the doctors told her that she had a few months to live.
Finally, in April, a handsome blonde decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where her family visited her every minute, who even arranged a wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for the last two-month anniversary.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, her social media account made a donation that Gema wrote for her family.
"If this has been published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones behind, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible illness has caused me.
I cannot thank Ricky enough, who was by my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network, saying that the pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social media followers," she wrote, adding that everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, passers-by acquires a pocket piece of mostly beginner Czech artists.
Images and other creations create directly for the artmat, so they know in advance that they have to fit into a size of 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," Petra Widžová, curator of the project, explained.
Artmat works with the principle of coincidence.
The buyer can thus be surprised at the work of art he gains.
Currently he can become the new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutková prepared a memory with a walk in Prague.
Cards need to be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket packs of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from a trouper and fortune-teller cards, the second series of illustrations based on her Spiritist comic book.
Salaries in health care will increase by not more than five percent next year.
The larger increase is unrealistic according to Vojtěch
Salaries in health care could increase by no more than five percent next year, said the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in Václav Moravec's Questions on Czech Television.
The unionists' demand for an increase of up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in securing protective equipment.
According to him, hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (payments) may be somewhere up to five percent," said the minister.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when since March it has intervened in the selection of coronavir insurance pandemics and government regulations against its spread.
Insurance companies' incomes dropped at the time.
"I have a 15 percent increase that seems unrealistic at the moment," Vojtěch said.
According to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS), the average monthly doctor's earnings in acute bed care will probably reach CZK 88 312 this year, sisters CZK 47 498.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the wages of other founders will be up to 7,000 crowns.
The IHIS data also indicate that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
According to data from the Czech Statistical Office, the average wage in the Czech Republic was CZK 34 125 in 2019.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally by 15 percent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be guided by salary tables, and contract wages in hospitals of cities, regions or private hospitals.
They therefore also require that health care professionals be united in the salary tables.
For nurses this year the difference will reach up to 7,000 crowns per month.
But, for example, last year, wages grew faster than wages.
According to the President of the Czech Stomatology Chamber Roman Šmucler, trade unionists should perceive the state at present.
Recently, due to the effects of the Covid epidemic, the House approved an increase in this year's government deficit to a record CZK 500 billion, of which CZK 1.75 billion is due to go to hospital and social payouts.
The Council of Health Care Providers according to Šmucler disagrees with the general increase in salaries next year.
According to him, pay should be decided by the hospitals themselves and medical establishments, and the extra money should go to them through a payment decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
This week, Pavel Švagr, Chairman of the Administration of State Material Reserves (SSHR) said that the administration does not currently have one protective medical aid.
He's waiting to complete the competitions.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now better able to supply goods than in March when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
A scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they're sending a message.
"Smart quarantine works, there's something to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss this with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly, and the question is whether they should not be in charge again," said the Prime Minister on Sunday on his Facebook program Hey people.
According to him, IT systems and sanitary stations are not sufficiently connected, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the prime minister in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Speaker of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek told ČTK that he does not have information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this move, according to him.
The Smart Quarantine Project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until that time, a smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the military as a government advisory body led by former minister's Deputy Minister Roman Prymula.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) criticized the scrapping project on Sunday.
He also said that the army could take him back.
Weaknesses in the project were previously acknowledged by the government's IT and digitization agent Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project.
"The system works, but it's still working.
For 20 years, it's been self-contained and unsystematic, now we're trying to unite in a few months.
It's not going through the nozzle.
People as they go, poor people in hygiene as they go, adapt the new systems and actually pick up the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava's Mayor Macura won't run again, because he doesn't want to "go crazy in politics"
The current Mayor of Ostrava Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort to "do not go crazy in politics," he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO Bureau, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the local elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the electoral votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I could hold on to one term, and with my experience in business, I could turn everything around and get on my feet," he said to Respekta.
He added that for the second parliamentary term he was persuaded to a certain extent.
"But for me, it's as good as it gets.
I don't want to fool around with the politics," said Macura, who described himself as a heavy introvert who is not comfortable with frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation about Macura's possible end in the YES movement for a long time.
The server recalls that Macura criticised the YES movement several times, for example, for an alliance with the SPD or for the support of Miloš Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few ANO personalities, Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahoš supported the election.
Macura is not planning to leave the YES movement he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile struggle and that no one is coughing in it, I have no immediate motive," he said to Respekt.
Sixty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming Mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura was, among other things, the director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat in the organs of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
Uber will return to Brno at the end of July, which offers transport services.
This is a consequence of the change of the law, stated on Thursday in the press statement of the Brno City Councillor for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
The taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as the designation of a taxi or a tax meter.
By changing the law, however, the conditions for operating ordinary taxis and alternative taxis have changed since July.
Kratochvíl has held several meetings with representatives of Uber in recent weeks.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year with its services.
This step is a consequence of the amendment of the law which allows this company to operate legally.
The city was aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
The taxi drivers protested against him for not marking the vehicles as a taxi or a missing meter.
The court issued a preliminary measure that banned Ubera from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but last year at the end of the year Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to the later rulings of the courts, Uber could ride in Brno, but the company did not use it.
Now they will return on the basis of a change of law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a meter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively via mobile applications.
Too luxuriant celebration in Brno: the flying chair landed a metre from a man on the sidewalk
The office chair flew out from the fourth floor of the apartment building on Saturday evening in Brno and landed about a metre from the sidewalk.
At that moment, a pedestrian came after him, who immediately called the officers.
Immediately upon arriving at the address mentioned in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which there were still chairs and several cans and butts.
"The ear, which was carried from the room on the fourth floor, indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
Officers went out in the hallway to the apartment and asked three young men from 26 to 29 years of age to explain," said spokesperson Jakub Ghana.
Request to appeal Rafaj discuss Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with coalition social democrats on Monday a request for the appeal of the head of the Antitrust Office (ÚOHS) Petr Rafaj.
Rafaj's appeal was called upon by non-profit organizations to discuss the anti-corruption council of the government and also by the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats say that the exchange at the head of office is appropriate.
According to the information of ČTK Rafaj was not invited to the Office of the Government on Monday.
The second mandate will end in the middle of next year, according to the law cannot be appointed for the third time.
His appeal is under the authority of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the call of nonprofit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason is to include Rafaj's recent cases.
In the past week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the request to get acquainted with the materials and the government parties would take a "some position".
He also stated that he had not yet negotiated the challenges with the President, he did not have an appointment with him anytime soon.
According to the C.O.H.S. statement, there's no reason to appeal because Rafaj wasn't charged with anything.
IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz have written in the past week that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with Governor Jiří Čunk.
The meetings linked, among other things, to the decision-making of the project for a controversial new Zlin hospital worth eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard.
Chunek admitted the meetings, according to him, together they dealt with his "senate activities".
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The representatives of the Ústí Region called on the Government to appeal Rafaj at the end of June.
It also asks for reform of the Authority's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the ÚOHS regarding public contracts according to Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek is not transparent and has the characteristics of arbitrary.
Last March, police intervened in the antitrust office for a tender to choose a myth.
This June, the news server Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments written on the company of influential behind-the-scenes player Alexander Čuba.
The advance of 3.5 million to the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been chaired by the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, for the second term of office the President of the former Member of Social Democracy appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, the Rafajs will have their second six-year mandate.
The Antitrust Office Act states that the President may dismiss the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it has not been in office for more than six months, or significantly undermines the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the library of Blanen, workers collapsed in the heat.
Air Conditioning Helps
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children, we go to the library in the centre of Blansko regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was virtually impossible to endure.
It was so hot and bad air.
Ventilation didn't help.
That is why I am glad for air conditioning," said one of the blank readers Petr Novotný.
According to the library manager of Lukáš Dlapa, the temperature in the building often went up to 30 degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and on sunny days it works as a greenhouse.
"In addition, the sun leans on it due to the curvature of the building for much of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem for individual departments to air out, because the window must be closed overnight for security reasons.
We often have this since morning in the library to 30 degrees," Dlapa said.
The worst part was the study room and reading room on the third floor.
And upstairs, the exhibition room and the principal's office.
The climate was also unpleasant in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes it happened that Librarians collapsed at work and ended up in an incapacity for work.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes it was impossible to breathe there," Dlapa remarked.
Originally, representatives of the city wanted to do air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there'll be only three circuits out of five.
"Because of limited funding, air conditioning will have only the most problematic areas.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department are upstairs," said Jiří Svoboda from the Blanen Investment Department.
He added that in the first phase the workers had already installed air conditioning and modified the wiring in the above areas last autumn.
Approximately 360,000 crowns.
The Blansko City Library has nearly 3,000 registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
The curtain of Chicago has driven out the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who are silent about the health of players and do not publish anything at all.
As one of the few, he got off the Crawford line.
A 35-year-old native from Montréal was only present at the first training, and since then he has been absent from the lineup.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and therefore I have spent the last two weeks locked up in my house," he revealed the reason for my absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford's ready to go back to the full load.
"It's amazing to be back.
I will do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
Experienced goalie won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goal range is already the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks await first a preparatory duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in the foreground.
Thousands of people protested against the Prime Minister in Israel
Thousands of Israelis in several places protested against unemployment, corruption, and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu handles the coronavirus crisis.
Manifestos took place, among other things, in front of Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants demand the resignation of Netanyahu for a trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as for the government’s solution to another wave of coronavirus epidemics.
"Bibi, go home," according to AP, one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the Emperor has lost his clothes," it said on another.
Seventy-year-old Netanyahu is the first prime minister of Israel to be tried in the performance of his duties.
He's being charged with three counts of corruption, fraud, and misappropriation.
He rejects all charges and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial may last up to three years, with over 300 Witnesses being summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was confirmed in Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, with nearly 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures to help reduce the daily rises of the infected.
After the gradual release of restrictions from the end of April, however, the numbers of the infected began to rise significantly again at the end of June.
Netanyahu’s critics claim that the government has not helped enough, for example, traders affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters are also concerned that the government is issuing conflicting guidelines in the fight against coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out by firemen from the wreck.
Tragic accident occurred around 23 o'clock near Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapská dam.
Apparently, the driver flew down into the woods at no small speed and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be removed from the wreck by firefighters, including cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the crash are investigated by police officers.
They ordered a forensic autopsy to explain, among other things, whether a man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and spewing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change of strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to spout one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the greatest environmental polluters is not news.
Thus, billions of clothing ends each year in incinerators and landfills.
The view of slow fashion, often despised approach to dressing, has changed quite quickly over the last few years.
About half of Pietro's goods were sold to Filipi at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to the discounts, is not easily bought.
The company does not want to spout one collection after another and at the end of each season the products are cheaper than their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner Michal Mička, the times of new and old collections and blind follow-up of fast-changing fashion trends are over.
"Most traders already count on discounts when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
This is actually a bit of a scam," says Michal Mička, owner of Pietro Filipi.
Moreover, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our product is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and overseasonal.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands absent any discounts is typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed," Mička adds.
Giant graffiti presents RAF flier Kurt Taussig
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work, liked the design.
He used about 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton’s organization, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig made it to Great Britain, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then underwent pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine in Africa.
He was involved in combat operations early in 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, known by people in the field of street graphics under the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in the warm streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the areas that were earmarked for these purposes by then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
The Hanna storm has reached the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight SELČ on the night of today) on the southwest coast of the American state of Texas.
He struck the island of Padre Island, Texas, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and weakened into a tropical storm as he moved over the mainland.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a great danger to coastal residents.
It brought strong wind and intense rainfall; along with local floods, according to the AP, electricity outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and recommended a voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was given to people from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and the Bay of Mesquite Bay, but the element is supposed to hit the area nearly 500 kilometers long before it gradually moves over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes can pose a threat," warned the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC).
This morning local time (the afternoon SELČ) the storm moved in the area of the American-Mexican border and was accompanied by wind at a speed of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year’s hurricane season in the Atlantic region on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by a wind of up to 145 km per hour, but as it progressed to land, it gradually weakened to 112 km per hour, which eliminated Hanna from the hurricane category again.
The authorities called on the local population to survive the storm at home, not forgetting the sanitary measures involved in preventing the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is one of America's most plagued pandemics of covid-19 disease.
Due to existing security measures and the need to maintain distances, evacuations are also a major challenge.
The temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Hidalgo district of Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter after evacuation, who had a positive coronavirus test or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have called on all evacuations to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter, if possible.
"We haven't even gotten it over with yet.
We expect catastrophic floods," said AP Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts claim that in some places it could rain up to 300 millimeters of rain within a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimeters, which, along with the swelling of sea level, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman will lend the general rank to Colonel Lipko
President Miloš Zeman will lend the general rank to Colonel Pavel Lipk on Wednesday.
This is based on an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for granting the rank of Brigadier General is the August arrival of Lipka on the post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Multinational Division Northeast in Poland.
Lipka is still a deputy commander of the Czech army's ground forces.
Zeman's promotion was proposed by the government at the end of June.
Since the beginning of August Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka in the position of Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division North-East in Elblag, Poland, which commands the units of the Alliance forward presence on the territory of Poland and the Baltic.
In March, Řehka became Director of the National Office for Cyber Security and Information Security (NÚKIB).
The government has suggested to the president that Lipko lend the rank of Brigadier General.
Under the Occupational Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be granted to a soldier for the duration of the elected post or for the duration of the service assignment required by the higher rank.
The post of Deputy Chief of the Alliance Division corresponds to the general rank.
A soldier to whom the rank has been granted has the same rights and duties as if he were appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that corresponds to the rank.
The rank loan lasts until the reason for which it was provided.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
He is significantly involved in the performance of the tasks of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and security of military participation in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on the proposal for a promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, will be attended by the Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer announced it.
Among the agreed standards is keeping distance or wearing masks on the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats on the aircraft will not have to remain vacant.
Reuters reported it.
"I am glad that my colleagues adopted the German proposal for Europe and that we were able to agree on these uniform standards," said Scheuer at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement was concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover your mouth and nose for passengers over six years of age, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
There must be plenty of fresh air on aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards caused confusion.
On the Arctic Spitsbergen, the temperature record fell, they measured almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen," said the Norwegian Meteorological Institute on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, thus breaking the record of 1979 by 0.4 degrees, added.
Roughly 2,000-year-old Longyearbyen is the largest city in Špicberky, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Spitsbergen heat faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the danger arising from the warming of other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, mentioned in last year's report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature in Špicberky has increased by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it can even rise ten degrees if greenhouse gas emissions do not decrease into the atmosphere.
Temperature growth in Špicberky can result in melting of ever-frozen soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads, or airports, and can cause more avalanches and landslides.
The Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals that depend on the ocean’s ice cover, also threatens the warming of the climate.
British returning from Spain are facing mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all roads to mainland Spain that were not necessary due to the risk of spreading the disease Covid-19.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but even after returning from them people must be isolated for two weeks.
New rules come into force at midnight.
"Protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," British diplomacy said in its statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the safe list," she said.
As Britain’s Metro newspaper noted, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of British people.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, the British are concerned about whether they will be paid sick if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a 10-day vacation on Lanzarote, scheduled to leave on Tuesday.
The trip has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and my daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as an engineer, and I don't think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after my vacation," said Metro Hunter.
In the context of Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of epidemics.
In the last two days, over 900 newly infected have been added there every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening up coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia, to limit all nightlife and to prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently drawn attention to the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The government will discuss the model of the purchase of electricity from Dukovan
On Monday, the government will discuss the model of the purchase of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The draft law foresees that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, all consumers will pay the difference through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final electricity price for customers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for YES) and the energy company ČEZ have already stated that the more likely option is that people will save thanks to the construction for electricity.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
The intention has been criticized by environmental organisations before.
"The purchase price may be below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can thus be both negative and positive.
The impact will be spread among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - at lower consumption or electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) stated in the material documentation.
Havlíček said in May that he assumed that the wholesale price of electricity would grow and people at the Dukovan site would earn money.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns will be per family per year, which is far less, according to him, than people pay in electricity invoices every year to support so-called supported sources.
He had already estimated that the purchase price could range from 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any draft amount, it is to be included in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders now stock most, currently amounts to around EUR 45 (about CZK 1190) per MWh.
"With the difference in the purchase price and the market price of the power electricity of ten euros, an average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year could pay a supplement - it can correspond to four-member households, equipped with electrical appliances including electric hobs and ovens, but it does not use electricity for heating and heating hot water - less than 100 CZK/year," the MIT government said.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
Coronavir pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a highly speculative issue," said Tomáš Voltr, Executive Director of the Energy Financial Group.
The proposed law envisages the purchase of an MIT or a legal entity owned by it at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the State, guaranteeing conditions for the purchase of electricity, would have been concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but no longer until the operation of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design is defined as a power plant with a nuclear reactor connected to an electricity system with installed capacity of a minimum power output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovan block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity annually, which would correspond to the tenth expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The government approved the financing model for the new Dukovan bloc on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the State on an interest-free basis, with a 2% interest rate calculated on the basis of the operation.
The opposition disagrees with the model of financing, it also resents the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
In May, CEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told ČTK that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is approximately EUR 6 billion (approximately CZK 162 billion).
Contracts between the State and ČEZ on the construction of a new Dukovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development has withdrawn two billion media tourism support material.
The material according to which the Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns on the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on holiday in the Czech Republic was withdrawn by the Office from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for YES) server SeznamZprávy.cz said that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was highlighted on Friday by the server Zdopravy.cz.
The Ministry justified the plan by the decline in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a decline in income.
The proposal sparked criticism of the opposition and representatives of tourism.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the hlidacstatu.cz website, MMR planned to give money to CzechTourism through the State Tourism Support Agency for advertising in televisions, radios, newspapers, Internets, billboards or railway stations.
The largest share of money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
Prima and Nova private television would get most of it.
Printed journals and weekly newspapers would get 400 million and the same piece would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would get 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would get a private station again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and railway stations or metro stations.
The tourism campaign in the Czech Republic was to start in mid-August and take a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is certainly not yet in the form that should be presented," Dostálová said without further details to the server ListNews.
The material criticized the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarová Adamová would benefit the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this pretentious contempt will be struck between the eyes in the fall of the election," she tweeted.
Dostálová rejects that this is actually about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she said on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course we are still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's work material," she said.
Initially, saving tourism doesn't make any sense to a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not a useless advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, chairman of the initiative on Sunday.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
The broth of life, the cock of beer and death like a blade of grass
The third album entitled A Death is also posthumous is a blade of grass of Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who left also a year ago on May 24.
Frič's discography is the fifth item and, like previous titles, here is the main emphasis on Frič's poetry, which he himself is an excellent performer.
Frič, in 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but he passed this inspiration through his own, distinctive experiences and also very inner manifestations of faith.
Of course, he was far away from any agitation, whether he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, totally tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradíček), the masters will forgive.
Frič's album offers records of the author's reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the violinist Josef Klíž, or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I can help - I like - in the words of Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poems.
"They were filled with a proud and endless bitterness," says Hruška, "over the state of our world threatened by extinction.
The world, which is increasingly sinking into dull consumer vanity and greed, is getting further and further away from what his soul was made of - the secrets of faith, humility and human proximity.
In them there was the homesickness of one who knew that the values for which he was created were of little interest, but who also knows that only because of the general lack of interest can they not be renounced.
The poems reminded us that you may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how you lose it.
If he sells himself to general decline, he will sceptically resign, he will silence with fear, or he will remain calm and proud of what he believes and loves until the last moment."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamáček
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
Chairman of the Party and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Ham's said it on the Prima Partie TV show today.
On Friday, the news server ZnazeZprávy.cz informed that Paroubek should be a consultant to Hamáček.
"We write a text from time to time, he sends me some material sometimes and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added, however, that this is not official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the ČSSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"Sometimes I read his opinion, there are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a follow-up discussion with ODS Member Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still "listen openly to the views of Václav Klaus".
According to him, this is fine because it is an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
The fact that the media is making an affair out of this is what he called the mark of this year's cucumber season.
Server ListZprávy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek performs the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former president of the local cell Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and served as Vice-President of his party LEV 21, was heading to the fourth place of the party candidate in the region of Ústí nad Labem.
Hamáček said today that he would not comment on the composition of the candidate until it was ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile head start, it's a kick in the ass, laments the Swede's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American stickler who has ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis two years younger, and last year he was overpowered by the NCAA University Association.
"We had a battle a year before, then he won and I was second, then we switched.
In both cases it was a very good fight," Nilsen describes, who secured his victory with a power of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has since shot steeply up and is currently alone in the highest bars.
In just twenty years he became a world record player, this year on 8 February in Torun he surpassed a bar of 6.17 meters, a week later he added an inch in Glasgow.
"He jumped six meters at the age of 18 when he graduated high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he grew from boy to man, he would multiply all his potential and talent by ten.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record," he believes.
Even if Nilsen's list of achievements is thinner than the one that Duplantis prides himself on, the American sets goals like this.
He indicated his options at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, and this February he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August he won a gold medal at the Panamanian Games in Lima, already in 2017 he made his way to the American World Championship expedition, where he finished 13.
The closest milestone for him is to try the Diamond League for the first time.
"It is definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much in the Diamond League as possible, because there you can make a name for yourself," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly manage as well at events such as the Olympic Games, the World Cup or the Pan-American Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, giving Nilsen and the rest of the staff time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere silver fight?
"Everybody's trying to catch him, but I don't think it'll be possible anytime soon," Nilsen thinks.
"The kid's been jumping for 16 years, and in training, he's got a mile head start on everyone else."
And by the time Tokyo 2021 starts, he's gonna want to raise it.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands of years of disability retirement on an infirm son.
She's in for a trial.
The money a 33 - year - old man receives from the state as an invalidity pension is intended primarily to improve the quality of his life.
For embezzlement, a woman faces up to eight years in prison.
Because of poor health, the court deprived a sick man of his right, and appointed his mother to administer his son’s money, among other things.
"A woman from mid-November 2013 to January this year used part of her son's disability pension funds to deprive him of $440,000," police spokesperson Dana Ladmanová said, adding that the accused woman had a special obligation to defend the interests of the victim.
A woman, as instructed by the court, set up an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the cost of his son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, he used the remaining funds for the purchase of vehicles, electrical appliances and the running of the household," the prosecution says.
That she couldn't use her son's money for her own good, the woman confessed.
But she defended herself by helping to pay for her family expenses.
"We had problems with our incomes to tighten the running of the household.
We've never bought anything above standard.
It was always for things whose purchase the son would approve.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, says scientists after finding tools
The findings of the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spear or spear spikes.
Scientists have found that the oldest tools came from between 33,000 and 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said Archeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies published on this topic in Nature.
The youngest tools are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite Cave, located at a large altitude, has been inhabited for 20,000 years.
So far, the widely accepted theory has referred to the first representatives of Homo sapiens crossing the mainland bridge from today’s Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spear spikes used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this human culture has subsequently spread in much of North America.
However, this model has been fractured in recent decades when several ancient settlements, two to three thousand years older, were discovered.
The second study published in Nature magazine mentions 42 different locations throughout North America that prove human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to the North American mainland sooner than expected.
Some could have made it to America by boat.
"It is clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, on the new findings.
So far, the interest in tickets fills the optimistic scenario, claims the sellers.
Prices are gradually decreasing, too
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, the interest is still roughly half as high, but demand grows by up to 20 percent each week.
According to sellers, post-crisis developments thus fulfill the most optimistic scenarios.
The prices of tickets are gradually decreasing.
According to retailers, the most popular destinations are mainly southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At Letuška.cz, flights to Croatian Split are the most sold.
From other countries, the most sought-after United Kingdom is, however, one of the busiest destinations ever.
The average price of tickets is also reduced.
At Letuška.cz portal it was around CZK 6250 in the middle of the month, 3,000 in the year.
This is mainly due to the increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 % of sales.
However, prices are also falling to some European places, such as Spain or Italy in recent weeks, by about one-fifth.
The crisis also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets much shorter than before, because they are concerned about the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information, Kiwi.com bought the ticket before departure by approximately 10 days year on year.
"This confirms the future trend of people ordering tickets much less in advance, requiring greater flexibility, less risk," said Michal Šindelář, vice president for Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average reservation time before departure is 21 days.
Together with the growth of sales, the number of renewed air lines from the Czech Republic is increasing.
There are currently regular lines to more than 60 destinations at Prague Airport.
This year's summer season is about half the destinations.
The grand finale tonight!
Watch the dart fight live at Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC has walked to the big finale.
It will present experienced 44-year-old Scottish darter Gary Anderson and surprise tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson took out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the spreadsheet.
However, he and James Wade dealt with it, and in the quarter-finals, he had a good fight with Simon Whitlock, who had sent home world number one.
"Flying Scotsman" was very close in the semifinals when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel, in overtime dominated and after the result 18:16 he won a place in the finals of the tournament, which he dominated already in 2018, when in an amazing battle he defeated Mensura Suljovič 21:19.
World Matchplay's biggest surprise is Dimitri van den Bergh.
Belgian talent enjoys the tournament and perhaps knowing that it has nothing to lose has helped it to play on a fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old darter first took out Nathan Aspinall's world six, overpowered Jo Cullen in a dramatic battle, and defeated Adrian Lewis in the quarter-finals after a sharp start.
The big check was the semifinals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right at the beginning, but the calmly playing Belgian then gained an excellent lead in the series, which he then kept more or less without problems to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which struck the occasional uncertainty of the doubles.
Coronavir cases increased at least from the beginning of the week, the number of tests decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, it has demonstrably infected 15 212 people.
Almost 9,600 of them have been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, 5,254 people are ill.
This is based on data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times in a row of two hundred.
Maxim was Friday's 281 cases.
On Thursday there were 235 tested positives, a day earlier 246 and on Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 were infected.
From Covid-19, 9,590 people have been cured in the Czech Republic, i.e. 63 percent of all so far infected.
In most cases, the disease was mild.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 patients with coronavirus, 19 of whom are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days, in terms of 100,000 inhabitants, is still showing Karvinsko, almost 59.
Next is the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected patients, new measures have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday against the spread of coronavirus.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events of over 100 people, cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced from the current thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have demonstrably contracted the new coronavirus has already exceeded the 16 million.
Johns Hopkins University, U.S.A., reported this, which monitors the development of a pandemic globally.
According to this source, the balance of victims who died with covid-19 disease is close to 645 thousand.
The latest million infected have been added to statistics in just three days; the 15 million border fell on July 22.
In recent days, the United States, which already registers over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million, and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected.
The infected are now increasing at a record pace.
This week, the World Health Organization announced that from Thursday to Friday, more than 284,000 new cases worldwide have increased, the highest daily balance since the onset of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous states such as the US, Brazil, and India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases in the past week has increased in almost 40 countries around the world.
These include Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Israel.
The disease has already occurred in almost every country in the world, and the first case has been officially announced by the DPRK today.
The air in the homes is up to five times worse than outside.
Health is bad for air fresheners and deodorants
Health endangers not only poor air quality in the outdoors, but also at home.
The Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post, pointed this out.
According to Abraham, who was responsible for the creation of Israel’s Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is now that many people spend more time working from home to focus on household pollutants.
Abraham mentioned research by the American Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than outside air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year because of poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the epidemic of coronavirus, which has forced many and still forces to work from home, people must spend more hours in homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of air in households," said Abraham.
In Israel, according to her, almost nobody deals with the quality of "home air".
At the same time, things that you normally come into contact with can be dangerous - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides.
"The poisonous gas also produces clothes that we regularly wear to the dry cleaners," said Abrahamová.
According to her, children, old household members, and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk.
Even otherwise healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage the internal organs and the central nervous system.
Not all harmful substances, however, come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
Václav Havel Quiz: How long did he spend in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost its chance to advance to the highest Spanish football league because of the coronavirus infection on the team.
The management of the competition originally cancelled the postponed duel of the last round of the Second League, in which the team could ensure participation in the playoff.
Fuenlabrada reported another 12 infected people on Saturday, making the total number of positive tests for covid-19 in the club climbed to 28.
Because of the disease on the team, a Monday duel against La Coruni was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada had a point to get into the playoffs.
The competition management said today that the duel against La Coruni definitely called off due to the higher power because there was no more time to play it.
Fuenlabrad took the decision.
On the contrary, La Coruna is rebelling against non-playing.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save her, but she considers it unfair that the last round did not play out according to the practice complete in a single term.
The leadership of the former elite Spanish club is threatening to fall into the third league by court.
The first two teams of Huesca and Cadiz have the certainty of progress between the elite.
About the remaining third forward spot will be in the play off to clash Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche.
Karel Gott did not like Václav Havel?!
Dominic's daughter revealed it.
"Daddy didn't have to have him for many years," she revealed to Aha! The eldest daughter of Gott Dominik, saying that Master could not come to Havel's name and whenever he was mentioned, it always upset Karl.
It's hard to tell what they did to each other, but according to Dominic, the dispute started sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Daddy said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could have written in a drawer at the time of darkness, but if he had resisted in any way, he would have had an end to his career," says Gott.
Soon, however, he adds that the Czech greats eventually found their way to one another.
"I know Havel couldn't hear the word until he was 60.
But then the president congratulated him with a letter for his birthday and suddenly Dad's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
After all, ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because Dad regularly invited Mr. Havel to his home on Bertramka," added a blonde whose father died last October.
The Nightingale was also said to be sorry that he had never received a state medal from Václav Havel.
After all, he received it in 2009, although it was already from his successor in the office of Václav Klaus (79).
Another honour will come in memoriam, the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to grant him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.

The warning of meteorologists about the risk of fires concerns Central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí Region, Karlovy Vary and Plzeň Region.
The fire warning will be in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect any more significant rainfall to mitigate the danger in the northwest and west of Bohemia until at least the end of the week," says ČHMÚ.
The Prague City Hall responded to the warning of meteorologists by banning the setting-up of fires in risky places to apply from Tuesday.
